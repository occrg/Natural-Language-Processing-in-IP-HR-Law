# Project Requirements
* Visualisation of comparison of Intellectual Property and Human Rights statutes and scholarship (separately) with x-axis as time; y-axis as as intent/effect of statute/scholarship toward human rights to intellectual property; and z-axis as measure of extent to which statute protects the owner or the user
* Code must be well-written (readable, well-documented, refactorable) as it is likely to be passed on and used for future research
* GUI to allow upload of new statute which will then update data
