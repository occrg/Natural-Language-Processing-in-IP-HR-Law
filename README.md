## Outline
This is my University of Bristol Computer Scinece BSc Final Year Project. It involves creating a Natural Language Processing model and visualising the results.

## Motivation
The project is a contribution to a law academicâ€™s research into the growing relationship between intellectual property law and human rights law; in particular, the extent to which intellectual property laws involve human rights considerations, and their balance between consideration of creators and users.

* 'src' contains all code used in the project.
* 'submissions' contains all files submitted to SAFE throughout the project.
* 'thesis' contains the source code and resources for the final write-up and a PDF of the write-up so far.
