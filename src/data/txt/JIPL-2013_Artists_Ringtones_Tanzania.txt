Re-balancing artists’ rights in cell phone
ringtones? An analysis of Tanzanian copyright
Alex B. Makulilo*

Cell phones: some facts and ﬁgures
Cell phone ringtones have produced new challenges to
copyright law. From the 1990s, and particularly in the
2000s, cell phone ringtones have been big business in the
music industry across the globe. Although there are con-
ﬂicting ﬁgures on the precise income derived from the
ringtone business, it is undeniable that much revenue is
generated from it. To mention some current ﬁgures: it is
estimated that cell phone ringtone business accounts for
a little over 10 per cent of world-wide music sales.1
While this sounds good news to artists, the sharing of
such revenue has sparked controversies over copyright
laws. In the Unites States, the battle over revenue from
cell phone ringtone business culminated in the landmark
case of In re Cellco Partnership.2 Similar suits have been
considered by courts elsewhere. In East Africa, Kenya has
so far tested the application of its copyright legislation to
cell phone ringtones in court, in cases that include Alter-
native Media Limited v Safaricom Limited,3 Cellulant
Kenya Ltd v Music Copyright Society of Kenya Ltd,4 and
Music Copyright Society of Kenya Ltd v Safaricom Limited
and another.5 In Uganda, the ex-mayor of Kampala,
Al Haji Nasser Ntege Sebaggala has sued the giant
MTN Uganda Limited, claiming it has infringed his
copyright by using his speeches as ringtones without his
authorization.6 This suit, ﬁled in the Commercial Court
in Kampala on 13 July 2012, is pending.

This article focuses on copyright issues emanating
from the business of cell phone ringtone in the Tanza-
nian context. Discussion and analyses are delimited to
the Tanzanian Copyright Act and its regulations. Where
necessary, case law from other jurisdictions is persua-
sively referred since there is currently no such case law in
existence from the Tanzanian courts.

The author
† Alex B. Makulilo is a Lecturer in the Faculty of

Law at the Open University of Tanzania.

This article
† The aim of this article is to analyse copyright
issues arising from the use of musical works as cell
phone ringtones in the Tanzanian music industry.
† The point of departure for discussion is the Copy-
right and Neighbouring Rights Act, Cap 218 R. E
2002.

† The author argues that business practice does not
correspond to the provisions of this Act in the
context of cell phone ringtones. As a result, Tanza-
nian artists and the government lose revenue.

The problem
On 23 July 2012, The Citizen, a Tanzanian local news-
paper, bore an appealing headline, ‘How Bongo artists
miss billions in ringtone deals’.7 The paper reported that
OnMobile, a foreign company headquartered in Banga-
lore, India, provided ringtone services for the two major
mobile service providers, Vodacom Tanzania and Airtel.
However, OnMobile had contractual arrangements with
Push Mobile, a local company in Tanzania. The latter
signed contracts with artists to obtain licences to use
their songs as cell phone ringtones. According to the
paper, in the period before OnMobile came on to the
scene, particularly in the late 2000s, artists had to deal
with either Push Mobile or Spice, both local companies,
if they wanted sell their songs as ringtones; this ceased to

be the case following the arrival of OnMobile. Further,
The Citizen reported, out of the cell phone ringtone
business in which a ringtone costs 300 Tanzanian shil-
lings (approximately US$0.19), Vodacom Tanzania and
Airtel earned a total of 80 million Tanzanian shillings
per day (approximately US$ 50,777), of which the two
mobile ﬁrms retained between 75 and 80 per cent. The
rest was paid to OnMobile. It was further reported
that, after Push Mobile had received its share from
OnMobile, it retained everything, leaving only 7 per cent
to the artists. On another occasion, Push Mobile ad-
mitted that copyright had always been an issue in the
music industry.8 Also, on monitoring sales of ringtone
by mobile phone companies, Push Mobile said it pro-
vided artists with viewer accounts where they could
see how many songs had been sold and how much they
earned.9

On 24 July 2012, ringtones were at the centre of the
Parliamentary budget session for the 2012/2013 ﬁscal
year. Kigoma North Constituency Representative Zitto
Kabwe accused the mobile service companies and agent
ringtone providers of
from artists. It was
Kabwe’s submission that the act of under-paying artists
their royalties amounted to stealing their copyright
works.10 He suggested that the proceeds should have
been shared ﬁfty-ﬁfty between artists and mobile service
companies.11

‘stealing’

In a move to reorient their position, on 1 August
2012, artists collected 127 signatures and petitioned to
cancel all existing contracts with companies initially
authorized to deal with their songs.12 The companies
targeted in the petition were Push Mobile, Crystal and
Spice, which either directly or indirectly (through
OnMobile)
telecom companies
Vodacom, Airtel, Zantel and Tigo. Part of the petition
read as follows:

contracted with

We, the artists of Tanzania in unison irrespective of the
genre, instruct you to stop any further sale of our music in
terms of caller tunes and ringtones to mobile phone com-
panies.13

Through a hired law ﬁrm, Trustworthy Attorneys, the
artists served seven-day demand letters to Push Mobile,

Crystal and Spice to cancel their contracts with those
companies on the basis of ‘unfair dealings’.14

Apart from big telecom companies and ringtone pro-
viders, the ringtone issue has implicated individuals.
Two years ago, in Mwananchi, a sister paper of The
Citizen, Mr Festo Plea, a columnist, authored an article
with a headline, ‘COSOTA mnalijua hili la walanguzi wa
Kariakoo?’ translated in English as ‘COSOTA do you
know the pirates at Kariakoo?’15 According to the col-
umnist, pirates were operating openly at Kariakoo, the
largest market in Dar es Salaam and the biggest business
centre in Tanzania, burning CDs containing artists’ copy-
right works. The pirates were also illegally downloading
artists’ songs and transferring them into end users’ cell
phones to be used as ringtones. This ringtone business
earned the pirates between 2,500 and 3,000 Tanzanian
Shillings (around US$1.58 to US$1.89) for each song.

Interviews held between Nassibu Juma,

alias
‘Diamond’ and Ally Kiba (both prominent artists in
Tanzania), on the one hand, and the author of this
article, on the other16 raised a number of legal and prac-
tical issues:
† Both artists conﬁrmed they had, or continued to
have, contracts with Push Mobile, Crystal and Spice
on use of their songs as ringtones.
† These contracts were based on negotiations which
took into account a number of factors, such as the
popularity of the artist and his songs.
† Those contracts were usually for an indeﬁnite period
in which the artists received monthly royalties from
sales of their songs.
† The two artists complained that they were not in a
position to monitor sales of their songs and were
denied monthly ﬁnancial statements by the compan-
ies according to their contracts.
† Because they were not in a position to monitor sales
of their songs, they suspected that what they received
as royalties was little compared to the huge revenues
earned by the companies.
† Asked why they bypassed the Copyright Society of
Tanzania (COSOTA), Tanzania’s collecting society, in
their ringtone deals, the two replied that, although

they were members of the society, which should
administer their works in the ringtone deals and
others, COSOTA failed to discharge its mandate.
† The two artists maintained that there were many
pirates across the country who sold their songs illegal-
ly as ringtones.

This background raises a number of copyright questions.
First, what copyright subsists in customized cell phone
ringtones? Secondly, who has what right in the copyright
of cell phone ringtones? Thirdly, to what quantum of
royalties are right holders entitled? Finally, who has
standing to enforce ringtone contracts? These questions
are considered in the following sections of this article.

Copyright in ringtones
In contrast with traditional ringtones which are supplied
with cell phones by their manufacturers, customized cell
phone ringtones in Tanzania are largely the songs of
Bongo Flava (contemporary urban youth music) artists.
Copyright subsisting in these ringtones is no different
from ordinary copyright protection in any other musical
recording, comprising an underlying musical work and a
sound recording which are protected under ss 5(2)(d)
and 32(1) of the Copyright Act respectively. This type of
copyright protection in Tanzania is similar to that
afforded in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the
United States of America and Jordan.17 Case law in these
jurisdictions to date may offer persuasive authorities
to Tanzanian courts when faced with similar legal
questions.

The Copyright Act, however, deﬁnes neither ‘musical
work’ nor ‘sound recording’. Some authorities have
attempted to deﬁne ‘musical work’ as consisting of the
musical notes and lyrics (if any) in a musical compos-
ition.18 The UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988 deﬁnes ‘musical work’ as a work consisting of
music, exclusive of any words or action intended to be
sung, spoken or performed with the music.19 In other
words, ‘musical work’ under UK law consists of only
musical notation (composition) without lyrics. As to
‘sound recording’
the UK Copyright, Designs and
Patents Act 1988 deﬁnes it as (a) a recording of sounds,
from which the sounds may be reproduced, or (b) a

17 See eg Ramzi Madi ‘Copyright Issues in Mobile Phone Ringtones in
General and in the Light of the Jordanian Copyright Protection Law’
(2012) 18(3) Computer and Telecommunications Law Review 1; O Oluwole
Popoola and Maurice T Vambe ‘Copyright Protection of Ringtones in
South Africa’ (2008) 5(2) Muziki: Journal of Music Research in Africa 323;
Daniel M Simon ‘Cellphone Ringtones: A Case Study Exemplifying the
Complexities of the s. 115 Mechanical License of the Copyright Act of
1976’ (2008) 57(6) Duke Law Journal 1865; Jennifer Mariano Porter

recording of the whole or any part of a literary, dramatic
or musical work, from which sounds reproducing the
work or part may be produced.20 The question whether
the Tanzanian courts are ready to read these deﬁnitions
into the Copyright Act cannot be answered until litiga-
tion involving the meanings of such terminologies
arises.

Rights and owners of rights in ringtones
As mentioned, there are two layers of copyright in a
musical recording: the underlying musical work and
sound recording. Accordingly, there may be more than
one owner of a copyright to a cell phone ringtone with
different rights depending on what one owns. In an
underlying song there are usually two persons who own
distinct copyrights: ﬁrst, there is the lyrist who owns the
lyrics in a composition. Secondly, there is the composer
who owns the music or musical notes. Sometimes it is
possible for one person to be both the lyrist and com-
poser of an underlying musical composition. Each such
author enjoys copyright as an author under s 5(2)(d) of
the Copyright Act. Yet a composer has to obtain a
licence from a lyricist if he or she wants to avoid copy-
right infringement. Importantly, as owners of copyright,
both the lyrist and the composer have exclusive econom-
ic and moral rights under ss 9(1) and 11 of the Copy-
right Act respectively.

Similarly, there are persons who, though not part of
the underlying musical composition, perform musical
works: these performers (eg singers, musicians, dancers
and actors) hold a range of rights under s 31 of the
Copyright Act. Under this provision, performers have
exclusive rights slightly different from those of authors
of copyright works under s 5 of the Act.

The second important component of a musical
recording is the sound recording. Its author is the record
producer.21 In order to avoid copyright infringement,
the record producer must obtain a licence from the per-
former.22 Section 31(1) of the Copyright Act grants the
producer of a sound recording exclusive economic
rights.

There is one further group which generally beneﬁts
from copyright-protected cell phone ringtones, and
which acquires rights through contractual arrangements

with copyright owners: this group includes telecom
companies (eg Vodacom Tanzania, Airtel, Zantel and
Tigo), ringtone providers (eg OnMobile, Push Mobile,
Crystal and Spice) and end users. Sometimes the provi-
ders of ringtones do not have any contractual arrange-
ments with copyright holders, as is the case, for example,
with pirates operating at Kariakoo who illegally transfer
artists’ ringtones into end users’ mobile phones. End
users have rights of use of copyright works upon
payment of a fee per each downloaded song.

Licence and royalties
In Tanzania, an individual artist may license copyright
for use of his or her musical works as ringtones. Quite
often artists and ringtone providers bypass COSOTA.
This approach may violate Regulation 3 of the Copyright
(Licensing of Public Performances and Broadcasting)
Regulations 2003, which provides that no person shall
hold a public performance of or broadcast a work in
which a copyright subsists except under a licence issued
by COSOTA. This is, however, subject to one qualiﬁca-
tion: Regulation 3 concerns only artists who are
members of COSOTA. The same Regulation, incidental-
ly, binds ringtone providers.

Why bypass COSOTA, especially if you have regis-
tered yourself and your works with the society? The
reason always given is that COSOTA has failed to ad-
minister exploitation of artists’ works.23 As for ringtone
providers,
it is taken for granted that an individual
artist has private autonomy of dealing with his or her
copyright work.

In Kenya, in Music Copyright Society of Kenya Ltd v
Parklands Shade Hotel Ltd T/A Klub House,24 the High
Court took the view that the Music Copyright Society of
Kenya was not entitled to claim to be the sole licensed
authority which enforces copyrights of all musical
works.25 Instead, only the owner of the copyrights had a
right to enforce compliance.26 However, in Cellulant
Kenya Ltd the same court took the opposite view,
holding that:

the collecting society on behalf of the music artists had the
authority to deal with the plaintiff in regard to the music
that the plaintiff converted into ringtones,27

adding that:

the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it entered into individ-
ual agreements with the music artists, it is required in law to
deal with their legal representative i.e. the defendant (Music
Copyright Society of Kenya Ltd).28

In its reasoning, the court ﬁrst noted that the Copyright
Act does not speciﬁcally prohibit any party from enter-
ing into an individual agreement with a copyright
owner. Nonetheless, it ruled that the law deemed it ne-
cessary for a society to be established for the purposes of
coordinating and administering the collection of royal-
ties from persons who have been licensed by the copy-
right owners to exploit the copyright. Secondly, such a
society would possess the expertise and means of moni-
toring copyright users for the purposes of assessing the
quantum of royalties to be paid to individual copyright
owners.

Taking the two Kenyan cases

in the Tanzanian
context, Cellulant Kenya Ltd is highly persuasive for two
reasons. First, COSOTA is a statutory body established
under the Copyright Act with a function, among other
things, of administering exploitation of copyrights
works. Administration for this purpose includes collect-
ing and distributing any royalties or other remuneration
accorded to artists in respect of their rights under the
Act. Secondly, Regulation 3 of the Copyright (Licensing
of Public Performances and Broadcasting) Regulations
2003 prohibits holding a public performance or broad-
casting of a work in which a copyright subsists except
under a licence issued by the COSOTA. Thus ringtone
deals between artists and ringtone providers or telecom
companies are open to legal challenge.

The other controversial issue arising here relates to
copyright remuneration. Generally, this is a matter of
contract between copyright holders and users or licen-
sees. As mentioned, the governing principle is that
general rules of the law of contracts apply in all questions
relating to contracts for use of authors’ works.29 In Tan-
zania, rules of law of contracts are generally laid down in
the Law of Contract Act.30 For the sale of goods, special
rules of contract are laid down in the Sales of Goods
Act.31 Since Tanzania follows the English common law
system, common law rules as well as doctrines of equity
relating to contracts provide another source of contract
law. However, the Copyright Act provides for special

rules of copyright contracts too.32 These prevail over the
general rules of contracts.33

Under s 10 of the Contract Act, every agreement must
be supported by consideration.34 Where no such consid-
eration passes, an agreement is void.35 The common law
rule that consideration need not be adequate but sufﬁ-
cient applies in Tanzania as well.36 The overall implica-
tion ﬂowing from these rules is that artists cannot
simply forgo their right to remuneration for use of their
copyright works. Similarly, mere inadequate remuner-
ation for use of copyright works does not make licensing
contracts unenforceable.37 In other words, the author is
entitled to the remuneration agreed to in the licensing
contract. In line with this view, for example, s 31(4) of
the Copyright Act states clearly that:

nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive perfor-
mers of the right to agree by contracts on terms and condi-
tions more favourable for
their
performances.

them in respect of

This necessitates sound negotiation skills on the part of
authors. In Tanzania, most artists suffer from the lack of
such skills. Perhaps it is because of this, and generally to
protect the weak bargaining position of artists, that the
Copyright Act incorporates a special requirement that
the rate of contract remuneration shall be at an equitable
level. But, while the ‘equitable remuneration’ standard is
the benchmark rate in the Copyright Act38 this principle
applies only ex post ie after discovery of disproportionate
remuneration.39

While the Copyright Act is silent as to what is ‘equit-
able’, s 19 provides that ‘equitable remuneration’ relates
to ‘standards generally prevailing in similar cases’. Com-
mentators argue that compensation is equitable if it con-
forms, at the time of contracting, to what is customary
and fair in business, with regard to the type and scope of
the permitted uses, in particular their length and timing,
as well as to all other circumstances.40 As mentioned,
claims for ‘equitable remuneration’ in Tanzania can only

be raised under the following conditions set out in s 19
of the Copyright Act. First, where there is a ‘gross dispro-
portion’ between the remuneration paid to the owner of
copyright and the income from its use. Secondly, the
claim cannot be waived in advance. Thirdly, the claim
cannot be raised after two years following the discovery
of circumstances leading to it. Fourthly, the owner of the
copyright work may not claim discovery of such circum-
stances after the lapse of ﬁve years.

The legal signiﬁcance of a claim for equitable remuner-
ation is that, if successfully made, it displaces any contrac-
tual arrangement for equitable remuneration. However,
in the context of the present practice of ringtone business
in Tanzania, it is difﬁcult for artists to enforce claims for
equitable remuneration for several reasons. First, there is
likely to be a lack of sufﬁcient empirical evidence of dis-
proportionate remuneration: artists do not normally
monitor sales of their songs and, as they maintain, ring-
tone providers and telecom companies do not provide
them with statements of accounts. If this is the case, it
may be difﬁcult to establish the claim. This factor is exa-
cerbated where ringtone providers and telecom compan-
ies fail to provide true records. Secondly, the would-be
equitable ‘standards generally prevailing in similar cases’
are difﬁcult to ascertain in the Tanzanian music market
because the Tanzanian music market is highly constrained
by rampant piracy.41 Moreover, companies as well as indi-
viduals involved in music distribution have always under-
mined the position of artists by underpaying them.42 For
all these reasons, the ‘standards generally prevailing in
similar cases’ are always contested by artists for being un-
favourable on their side.

As stated, the Copyright Act exempts certain uses of
copyright works from the requirement
to obtain a
licence. These generally fall under the provisions relating
to free use. In connection with the ringtone business, a
controversial question has arisen whether ringtone pro-
viders are required to pay royalties for the public per-
formance of ringtones. This question resolves into two

Alex B. Makulilo . Re-balancing artists’ rights in cell phone ringtones

ARTICLE

further sub-questions. First, does the transmission by
downloading of a ringtone to a mobile phone constitute
a public performance? Secondly, when a ringtone goes
off, does that constitute a public performance? In In re
Cellco Partnership, a US decision, both questions were
answered in the negative. With regard to the ﬁrst ques-
tion, the Court said:

in analysing whether the transmission to a cellular telephone
qualiﬁes as a transmission of the work to the public, the
focus is on the transmission itself and its potential recipients
and not on the potential audience of the underlying work or
ringtone.43

Since the ringtone could not be played before the trans-
mission was concluded, there was no public perform-
ance.44 Obiter, the court added:

[E]ven if the customer could listen to the download (which
was not the case in the present case) as it was being received,
and contemporaneously perceive it as the musical work,
that could not constitute a public performance.45

As to the second question, the court ruled that when a
ringtone goes off—whether in public where other people
around may hear it or in private—that is exempted under
the performances of a musical work that occur within the
‘normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances’.46
The court focused its analysis around the term ‘publicly’
in the context of ringtone, which is basically intended to
the recipient of the call. It similarly exempted the per-
formance because mobile phone customers do not play
the ringtones for any commercial advantage; they receive
no fee or compensation for the performances; and they
do not charge admission.47 This court’s decision has gen-
erated scholarly debate. Since the Tanzanian Copyright
Act maintains similar provisions as the US law on exemp-
tion on the basis of private use, the In re Cellco Partnership
provides a highly persuasive authority.

Enforcement
As a general rule, the owner of copyright is the sole
person who may enforce compliance with the Copyright
Act in case of infringement of his or her rights. However,
the right of enforcement is subject to the mandate given
to COSOTA by the Copyright Act. Where an artist is a
registered member of COSOTA, the latter may enforce the

law, COSOTA
artist’s rights. However, under criminal
may be placed in a position to undertake investigation of
alleged infringements of the Act, and surrender the cul-
prits to the police for prosecution. Similarly, an artist may
lay down information to the police for the same purpose.
As things stand at present, the enforcement of the Copy-
right Act is still challenging for numerous reasons: lack of
culture of respect for copyright among the members of
public; lack of capacity by COSOTA to go around the
country to deal with infringers; lack of understanding of
the value of copyright among artists; lack of sufﬁcient
technological mechanisms to track copyright infringe-
ments; some weakness in the law; lack of sufﬁcient legal
and general training of copyright laws— and more.

Meanwhile, enforcement of

licensing contracts is
limited by the common law principle of privity of con-
tract. This principle requires that only parties to a con-
tract have the rights to enforce it. While the recent
petition by artists, comprising 127 signatures, is import-
ant, as it sends strong signal to telecom companies and
ringtone providers about fair remuneration in exploit-
ation of their musical works as ringtones, it cannot by
itself have any force of law to terminate licensing con-
tracts entered by individual artists with the telecom
companies or ringtone providers.

A modest proposal
This article has noted that the ringtone business is sprout-
ing in the Tanzanian music market. However, the exploit-
ation of copyright in the context of this business remains
a big challenge. A number of copyright issues have been
raised and discussed and unfair
remuneration has
emerged as a serious concern following The Citizen
report. While a number of issues need to be addressed,
this article proposes, as a starting point, and with respect
to the theme considered here, that in order to re-balance
the position of artists and users of copyrightable works,
‘common remuneration standards’ be developed in order
to satisfy the requirement of ‘equitable remuneration’
envisaged under the Copyright Act. These ‘common re-
muneration standards’ must only be minimum standards
that may be periodically reviewed when circumstances
arise. While these standards may protect the artists’ remu-
neration base, they must be left free to negotiate more fa-
vourable deals on their side.
