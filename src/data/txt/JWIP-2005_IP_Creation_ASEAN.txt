Intellectual Property Creation as Invention Patents 
for Development and Competitiveness in ASEAN 

Ngo Van LAM* and Thitapha WATTANAPRUTTIPAISAN*

INTRODUCTION 

I. 
Intellectual property  (IP) has been of increasing significance as a driver of the lead- 
time  advantage and business strategies of economies  and  industries. Indeed,  given  the 
highly  uneven  distribution  of  creativity  and  innovation  resources  across  the  globe, 
proprietary IP assets are key for the successful entry of business partners or competitors 
into national and world markets for goods, services and IP itself (Shapiro, 2000). Besides, 
most intellectual property rights (IPRS) are interdependent and &visible and, as such, they 
are registered, protected and apportioned in various tactical and strategic ways'  to ensure 
a more  efficient combination or a more  effective portfolio  of IPRS in order to prolong 
first-mover advantages and maximize innovation  rents. Additionally, firms with such a 
portfolio w d  be in a better position to negotiate for corporate mergers and acquisitions 
as well as for strategic technological alliances and licensing of needed or related IPRS.~ 
IP is a form of knowledge  or intellectual activity embedded in various ways in the 
value  chain.  This  chain  may  extend  from  sourcing  to  the  production,  advertising, 
marketing and distribution  of goods and services of an industrial, scientific, literary and 
artistic  nature.  An  analysis  of  the  patterns  and  characteristics of IP  generation  and 
registration within the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is of important 
policy significance and research interest for several reasons.

1  For  example, a patent  can also be  utilized as  a trade  secret in  technology  difision or transfer  licences, 
which,  as a rule, have  various geographical or field-of-use  restrictions. However,  trade  secrets also  pertain  to 
confidential  information  which  may  give  the  enterprises concerned a  competitive  edge.  In  addition  to  being 
technical or scientific, such information  can be  of a financial, commercial or negative nature, thus overlapping 
somewhat with database protection. Similarly, an industrial design can be protected under a property-based regime 
or one based on (civil) liabilities (for example, under unfair competition law) or even as copyright. Members of the 
World Trade Organization  are free to use both approaches to enforce compliance in case of registered industrial 
designs, while unregistered designs can be protected under the liabdity-based approach. 
*  In turn, this may (or may not) improve the performance of their  equity stocks and lower the interest on 
their  issued  securities  (because  of  the  superficial perception  of  higher  productivity  per  unit  of  research  and 
development spending and,  hence  of  future  profitability),  strengthen  their  negotiating  power  in  technology 
purchase and  transfer  deals,  and  boost  their  own  commercial value in  merger  and  take-over  talks  (Luthria and 
Maskus, 2003; Popp, 2003; Lanjouw and Schankerman, 1999).

O n  the one hand, IPRS are now directly linked to multilateral trade obligations and 
rights under the Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(the  TRIPS Agreement)  administered  by  the  World  Trade  Organization.  This 
Agreement  also  serves to  extend  IPR  protection  in  developing  economies  to  a  level 
comparable  to the  high  standards of developed  countries  (Maskus, 2000).  Moreover, 
there  exists  a  worldwide  trend  towards  stronger  and  broader  arrangements  for  the 
protection  of IP assets.  This appears in the so-called TRIPS-P~US 
regimes contained in 
many  bilateral  or  plurilateral free  trade  agreements  between  developed  countries  or 
regions and their developing counterparts  (Wattanapruttipaisan, 2004). 

On the other hand, there has been a great shortage of information and analysis on IP 
creation in ASEAN. Many economies in this grouping have a well-renown record of durable 
export competitiveness, fast-paced economic growth and social transformation, and broad- 
based poverty reduction for most of the past three decades. They now have to manage the 
policy  challenges and commercial pressures resulting f?om  rapid technological progress, 
intensified global competition-including 
more exacting and sophisticated market requirements. Meanwhile, the width and depth of 
science  and  technology  (S&T),  research  and  development  (R&D)  capabilities  and 
development institutions (including those relating to IP creation and IPR administration) 
remain hlghly uneven within ASEAN. Ths diversity necessitates differentiated transitional 
paths  and  focus  areas  in  technological  capacity  building  and  the  transformation  to  be 
pursued by government and business in the various economies of the region. 

fitom lower-cost  producers and imitators-and 

Patents for invention are the focus of this article because, firstly, these IP assets are 
the  most  important  component  of  industrial  property.3  Of  the  other  main  two 
components of industrial property,  trademarks and branding (although highly valuable 
commercially) are basically marketing tools, while industrial designs are, by  and large, 
of a non-functional  nature.4 Secondly, invention patents provide a good indicator not 
only of the capabilities and adequacy of a country’s S&T base and R&D activities but 
also  of its supportive legal, educational, financial and industrial infrastructure. Thirdly, 
patented IP assets are the cornerstone for discrete gains in productivity at the firm’s level 
and, through cross-sectoral spills-over and diffusion, of the enhanced competitiveness of 
sectors or of the entire economy. 

3  The lack of a standard terminology has  necessitated the interchangeable use in the discussion of the terms 
“triple-test patent” and “invention patent”. The latter class of registered IP assets is also known as “utility patents” 
in the United States. However, this class is not the same as “innovation patents” in Australia or “utility innovation 
patents” in Malaysia.’ These two terms are used to refer to second-tier or sub-patentable IP assets similar to “petty 
patents” or patents for utility models. 

4  In  particular, trademarks are  any  sign which  individualizes the  goods and services  of an  enterprise and 
distinguishes them &om those of its competitors  However, in some jurisdictions, sounds and smells can also be 
protected  as  trademarks.  Meanwhile, industrial  designs  refer  to  the  creativity  embodied  in  a  formal  and/or 
ornamental (non-functional) appearance of a mass-produced, industrial item that satisfies the need for better visual 
appeal to consumen and/or for the more efficient usage of the product concerned. Nevertheless, industrial designs 
of a functional nature can also be protected under the utility model or petty patent regime. Currently, patentable 
industrial designs include the topography (or lay-out design) ofintegrated circuits as well as indigenous and folkloric 
icons, symbols and designs (such as those found in traditional textile products). For further technical discussion on 
these matters, see WIPO (2001, pp. 65-77  and 111-119).

Nevertheless,  a  patent  itself is  an  intermediate  achievement.  Technologically,  it 
may  reflect  sophistication  in  S&T  and  the  productivity  of  R&D spending  but  not 
necessarily the  commercial  quantity  or quality of the  consequent surge in innovative 
output and flow-on  inventions as such.5 Additionally, patents do not capture all of the 
techno-scientific progress currently unfolding. This is because, firstly, most fundamental 
insights and much  of the basic research for the  creation  of “pure”  or pre-commercial 
knowledge are not subject to patent or copyright (Stiglitz, 2003; Daly, 2000). Secondly, 
many discoveries are not patentable because they are intangible or informal in nature. 
Additionally, such discoveries may not rise to the level of the novel and non-obvious 
inventions or of the original and creative works of authorship that still dominate current 
thinking  and institutional  practices with  regard  to  IP assets  and  their  registration and 
protection.  Thirdly,  the propensity  to invent  and  to patent  varies considerably across 
industries.  In  addition,  this  propensity  is  itself influenced  by  a variety  of tactical and 
strategic considerations by current or prospective IP asset owners. 

It should be noted that this article focuses on Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Thailand  and Viet Nam because of the availability of comparable data and 
information  on  IP  and  IPRS.~ However,  the  width  and  depth  of  this  analysis  is 
substantially  extended  with  comparative  illustrations on  the  patenting  activities, and 
their  technological  and  commercial  outcomes,  of inventing  entities in  a selection  of 
developed  and  developing  economies.  Such patents  may  be  registered at domestic  IP 
offices and/or  externally, such  as  at  the  United  States Patent  and  Trademark  Office 
(USPTO).’  Thus, the issues and  options highlighted  in  this  article for  the  attention  of 
policy makers and business and for further research will also be  of direct relevance to, 
and practical application in, many more developing countries than just those in ASEAN. 
The article is structured as follows. Sections II and 111 examine in detail the invention 
patents issued to ASEAN individuals, institutions and corporations by the local IP o6ces and 
the USPTO, respectively. Due emphasis is given to the volume, ownership characteristics 
and technological trajectories of those IP assets.  The objective is  to  highlight a range of 
firm-level constraints, issues and implications concerning IP creativity, the propensity to 
patent and the uthzation and distribution of commercial and technological benefits of the 
patented assets. Section IV looks at other major pressures and dilemmas with regard to IP 
creativity and technological transformation which require hrther attention and research. 

5  Indeed, the identification  of an accurate set of indicaton and weights for measuring and benchmarking the 
direct  outputs and other technological  and  commercial  externalities  associated with  inventive activities has  long 
remained  one of the strong motivations  for economic research in this area  (Griliches, 1990). 

6  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  People’s  Democratic  Republic  (the  Lao  PDR) announced  their  own  patent 
legislation in 2003 although it is not yet known whether their patent offices are ready to receive and process patent 
applications.  According  to  the  WLPo  (2001), there  exists  the  Emergency  (Patents)  Order  of  1999 in  Brunei 
Darussalam and the Patents and Design (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1946 in Myanmar. ASEAN, formed in August 
1967 with five original members, was subsequently enlarged with the admission of Brunei Darussalam in January 
1984, Viet  Nam  in July  1995, the  Lao  PDR and Myanmar in July  1997 and  Cambodia in April  1999. For  the 
purposes  of this article,  the  term  ASEAN refers  generally to the  ten-country  grouping regardless  of the  length  of 
membership and country-specific  differences in patent systems and procedures, unless where otherwise specified. 
7  It should also be noted that the  U.S. patents referred to in the following analysis are utility patents or patents 
for inventions in technology and industry and not design patents or plant patents, which are also granted by the U P T O .

11.  PATENTS FOR INVENTION IN ASEAN 

A patent embodies the right granted by a government to an inventor or a patent assignee 
or owner to exclude others from the commercial exploitation of the protected IP asset for a 
limited  and  speclfied period  of  time.8 In  exchange  or  in  return  for  ths  concession  of 
exclusivity as a private property right, the invention must be disclosed publicly in a manner 
which  is  sufficiently full, clear, concise and exact for  the  technicahies  to be  understood, 
replicated and practised by any person skilled in the relevant art or field of technology. Thus, 
the most significant requirements for patentability are the traditional triple test of being new 
(or  novel), being  non-obvious  (or inventive) and  being  useful  for  practical  purposes  or 
industrial applications, the latter requirement entahng the possibilities of malung things h-om 
the invention or of using the invention by technical means on a certain scale.9 

A.  LIMITED IP CREATION 

Table  1 presents the avdable statistics on triple-test patents registered in ASEAN during 
the period 1993-2002.  Notwithstanding some minor problems in the availability of serial data, 
it is clear that the number of patent grants to regional inventors was comparatively neghgible 
in the 1990s and that ths was even more so during the 1980s. Singapore is a notable exception 
to these observations but ,only from the late 1990s onwards. Thus, the creation of the most 
important component of industrial property assets in ASEAN casts a sobering undertone to the 
impressive economic performance sustained by  the  region’s  first  and second generation of 
newly industrialzing economies (NIES) over the past several decades.’” 

*  However,  although  a  government  may  grant patents  and  other  IPRS,  it  does  not  always  automatically 
enforce them. Most often, IPR  owners must  be also their  own “policemen”. More generally, patented assets and 
other IPFU have to be seen in an overall context with regard to the dichotomy between property rights and access 
rights. There are inherent  trade-offs  between  the need for the widest possible diffusion and adoption of IP assets 
and new technologies  and, on the other hand, the strong enforcement of IPR protection to foster R&D activities 
and their costly commercialization.  The intensity of such conflicting  trade-offs  depends on a country’s own socio- 
economic circumstances and its own perception of the gains or losses from greater protection at a particular stage 
of development and technological  transition  as  well as  over time. In particular,  trade-offs are well known  in  the 
“patents  complex”  involving  pharmaceuticals,  biotechnology  and  plant  varieties  (Maskus,  2000,  pp.  52-57). 
However,  difficult  and  complicated  policy  options  between  protection  and  access  are  also  present  in  other 
IP-related  matters such as business software and biodiversity.  There exists a massive volume of literature  on these 
matters  and, for  a  survey-type  examination of the  pertincnt  issues, see CIPR (2002, pp.  29-93),  Abbott  (2002), 
Kangnekar  (2002). Blakeney  (2002),’UNDP  (2002), Perlman  (2000) and  Scherer  (2000). See also Dutfield (2003, 
pp.  17-55  and 84-107) for an overview of major pieces of work on the above subjects.

9  However, neither the term “invention” nor the triple test is clearly defined. This has left considerable room 
for countries and their national laws to determine how strictly the three common standards should be applied and 
how the evidential burden  should be allocated. However, as  can be  expected, this persistent ambiguity  has given 
rise in practice to several inconsistencies in the interpretation of these matters internationally  (CIPR, 2002; UNCTAD 
and ICTSD, 2002). 

In January  1995, the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD) reclassified 
Singapore (along with Brunei Damssalam, the Bahamas, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) as a more 
advanced developing country. This was a follow-up  to an earlier decision made in 1992 by the OECD Development 
Assistance  Committee  to remove  these  high-income  countries from the list  of developing countries  eligible for 
official  development assistance.  Singapore  has not  applied  for  OECD membership, which would  bring with  it  a 
high-income, developed-country  status. In comparison, the Republic of Korea decided to graduate into this “super 
league”  in  October  1997 and, by  pure  coincidence, the  country promptly went  through  a serious financial and 
economic crisis in the same year. The nominal level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the Republic of 
Korea (US$10,553 in 2002) is still lower than that of Singapore (USS20.887 in 2002); the latter amount is classified 
as  high income by the World Bank. Meanwhile, Malaysia (with GDP per capita of US$ 3,880 in 2002) belongs to 
the World Bank category of upper-middle  income countries (with a lower and upper threshold  of US$2,936 and 
US$ 9,075, respectively, on the basis of gross national income in 2002).

THE JOURNAL  OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

1. 

INSIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF  INVENTIONS 

First, the number of invention patents held by ASEAN residents is insignificant both 
in absolute and relative terms. On average, for example, only 104 IP assets were patented 
per year in the six major ASEAN economies during the period 1993-1999  (1995-1999  for 
Singapore). That was less than 2 per cent of all the triple-test  patents issued by the local 
IP  offices  in  these  six  economies  to  both  residents  and  non-resident  inventors. 
Comparatively, the number of ASEAN  residents’ invention patents is equal to just 0.6 per 
cent  of the patent  grants received by local inventors in the Republic  of Korea  (almost 
17,000 a year) and to between  5-8  per cent, respectively, of the patents issued to local 
inventors in China and Chinese Taipei during the same period  (see Table 1). 

Second,  the  number  of  inventions  patented  by  residents  of  the  six  ASEAN 

economies during the period 2000-2001  averaged 239 per year, more than double the 
amount  of those  registered  in  the  1990s. However,  this  surge was  from  a  very  low 
starting  base,  while  the  observed  acceleration  in  patenting  activities  is  virtually  a 
worldwide  (and not  a regional) phenomenon.  Thus, the  higher  number  of registered 
patents  only  accounted for just  over 2 per  cent  of the  triple-test  patents registered to 
both  residents  and  non-residents  of  those  six  economies  in  the  same  period.  This 
number remains insignificant in relation  to those  granted  to inventors  resident in the 
Republic of Korea (being equivalent to just  over 1 per cent of the latter) and in China 
and Chinese Taipei (both in the range of 4 per cent) during the same two-year  period. 
Third, there was an even lower level of inventive  activities in the  1980s. Triple- 
test patents owned by ASEAN resident entities in the 1990s accounted generally for four- 
fifths of all the residents’ patents approved  during the period  1981-2001,  especially in 
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand  (Lam and Wattanapruttipaisan, 2004). Exceptionally, 
the Philippines recorded an average offorty patents a year during the period  1981-1990, 
compared to twenty-five  a year during the period  1991-2001.  The country’s declining 
inventiveness from the second half ofthe 1990s led to a Iower relative share ofjust under 
4 per cent (eighteen patents) of ASEAN residents’ patents during the period 2000-2001, 
compared to 29 per cent (fifty-seven patents) during the period  1995-1996. 

Meanwhile,  the  relative  importance  of  Thailand  increased  from  the  late  1990s 
onwards, as residents’ invention patents accounted for 18.3 per cent (or nineteen patents) 
and nearly 22 per cent (or 53 patents) of patented assets of ASEAN  residents per year during 
the periods  1993-1999  and 2OOC-2001,  respectively. Most notably, however, Singapore 
has  become  very dynamic from the late  1990s onwards, reflecting the greater focus on 
R&D into  microelectronics and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  biotechnology  from  home-grown 
research institutions and business undertalungs and from transnational companies’ (TNc) 
subsidiaries  (see Section  111  of  t h s  article). The  number  of  triple-test  patents  held  by 
Singapore residents increased fiom  an annual average of twenty-five  during the period 
1995-1998  to 240 in 2002, with an average of 144 per year during the period 1999-2002. 
Consequently,  Singapore accounted for a  rising share of 25 and 57 per  cent  of ASEAN 
residents’ patents between the periods 1995-1 996 and 2000-2001,  respectively.

2.  PREDOMINANCE OF NON-RESIDENTS’ PATENTS 

As has been previously noted in this article, non-residents’  patents accounted for 
97 per  cent  of all triple-test  patents  issued in ASEAN during the decade  1993-2002. 
Such  an  overwhelming  dominance  is  characteristic  of  developing  economies, 
however,  except  those  in East  Asia.  For  example,  in the  Republic of Korea,  non- 
resident  inventors  were  the  source  of about  two-thirds  of patent  grants  during  the 
period  1993-1995  but this share fell to just  over one-third  in the period  2000-2002. 
In fact, since  1995, the number of residents’ triple-test  patents  (6,575) has  exceeded 
that  of  non-residents 
(5,937).  However,  overseas  patent  holders  remain  quite 
substantial at 85 and  75 per  cent  of all patent  issues in  Chinese  Taipei  during these 
two-year  periods, 
to  the 
exceptionally  large number of patents  issued to non-residents,  for example averaging 
16,100 a year during the period  2000-2002.  In fact, non-residents’  patents registered 
in this East Asian NIE are more numerous than those issued to non-resident  inventors 
in  most  other  developing  economies,  as  well  as  in  many  developed  countries.  The 
great  interest  of foreign  inventors  in  protecting  their  IP assets  in  Chinese  Taipei  is 
because  this  island economy  is  a  highly  dynamic  and  important  export  production 
platform, especially of information  and communication technology  (IcT)  products on 
a global scale. 

respectively.  These  higher  percentages  were  due 

In contrast, the number of triple-test patent applications from, and grants to, non- 
residents has been relatively more limited in China. However, the situation has changed 
significantly from  the  mid-1 990s, and  this  reversal reflects several major  pull  factors. 
These include the huge and rapidly expanding domestic market, the substantial foreign 
direct investment  (FDI) inflows and their sustained rise to reach almost US$ 50 billion a 
year during the period  2002-2002,  the widened  scope for patenting contained  in the 
1992 revision of the Patent Law, membership  of the Patent Cooperation  Treaty (PcT) 
in January  1994 and the WTO in December 2001, and the powerful status of being the 
fourth-largest global traderin 2003 (with a turnover exceeding US$ one trillion). 

In particular, the volume  of non-residents’  applications  for triple-test  patents  in 
China started to surge from just  over 7,500 (38 per  cent of all applications) in  1993 
to almost  108,000 (80 per cent) a year during the period 2000-2001.  However, due 
to  resource  constraints  and  the  associated  examination  lags  of  several  years,  the 
number  of  patent  grants  to  non-residents  fell  from  3,187  (58  per  cent  of  all  the 
patents  registered  to  both  residents  and  non-residents)  in  1993  to  remain  largely 
below this level until 1998, when non-resident  patents issued in China reached 3,078 
(65 per  cent  of the total). This upward  trend has  continued, so  that  non-residents’ 
patent  grants increased further  to average  13,253 a year  (70 per cent of total  grants) 
during the period 2001-2002,  and for 2002 alone, 15,605 patents (73 per cent of the 
total)  (see Table  1).

B.  EXAMINATION LACS 

Long  delays  in  the  processing  of  patent  applications  before  grant  are  another 
universal  characteristic.  T o  begin  with,  the  triple  test  is  needed  to  differentiate  the 
existing state of the  art from an  addition  to  knowledge  and  to  minimize  the  risk  of 
granting  patents  which  are  too  broad,  thus  erecting  another  barrier  to  follow-on 
inventions. But  the  prior  art  search and  examination  process  itself can  be  very  time 
consuming.ll  Other sources of delay include,  on the  one hand,  the  typically chronic 
shortage of resources and  experience  among IP offices in most  developing  countries. 
This  applies  especially  to  technical  expertise  in  several  standard  and  new  areas  in 
industrial S&T and to modern facilities for complex search and examination  tasks. On 
the other hand, IP offices may have to ask for more support data and explanations from 
patent  applicants  while  patent  oppositions  can  be  raised  by  third  parties  or  other 
involved stakeholders. 

1.  WAITING TIMES  IN THE UNITED  STATES AND JAPAN 

What are the benchmarks in better resourced offices? Survey results from a random 
sample of 1,000 patent  grants in the United  States during the period  1996-1998 show 
an increasing waiting period for processing, averaging 2.8 years compared  to 2.4 years 
in  1994. The  additional  waiting  time  is  in  part  due  to  the  huge  increase in  patent 
applications (by 39 per cent to reach 243,100) and approvals (by 45 per cent to 147,500) 
between  1993 and  1998. Notably,  the  maximum  waiting  time recorded  for a patent 
grant  is  18.1 years and  the minimum  time,  1.2 years  (Allison and  Leinley,  2000). A 
recent and more comprehensive examination of over 1.65 million US. patents between 
1976 and 1996 revealed an average waiting time of2.4 years and an average number of 
11.7  (independent  and  dependent)  claims per  patent.  Both  studies find  that  patents 
relating to biotechnologies,  drugs, organic chemistry and software are subject to more 
pronounced  processing  lags  (typically  35-45  months).  This  is  because  of  the 
considerably larger number of citations of prior  art they contain (Popp et al., 2003). 

Comparatively, in Japan, the average waiting period for triple-test  patents reached 
three  years in  1985 although  a waiting time  of six  to seven years was  not  uncommon 
before  the  1988 reform  of  the  patent  system.  The  lengthier  prosecution  period  was 
largely caused by a severe backlog of patent filings which was, in turn, attributable to the 
prevailing limit on patent applications to a single, independent claim (also known as the 
head claim). Thus, multiple patents were often needed to protect an invention in Japan, 

This is  because that  prior  art  search  has  to cover all  technical  fields  of direct  relevance  as  well  as  those 
possibly analogous to the patent applications under consideration.  The search may not be limited just to materials 
in the search file of the national IP ofice concerned. If needed, it can be extended to technical journals (numbering 
some  700  currently), other  non-patent  documents  (such  as  technical  books,  with  over  8,000 published  in  an 
electronic  version), commercial  data banks  (with over 700 available in 2003) and other on-line  sources fiom the 
Internet.  Some data banks contain as  many  as  20  million patents  from 40 national  issuing authorities.  Popp et  nl. 
(2003) provide an interesting discussion of the complex and involved steps in the examination process, based in part 
on interviews with patent examiners in the USPTO. 

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  CREATION IN ASEAN

leading to the practice of “patent flooding” (with applications totalling about 340,000 in 
1987). The patent reform of 1988 provides for multi-claim applications, contributing to 
a steady rise from an average of 1.2 claims in  1987 to  4.7  in  1994 and 7.6 during the 
period  2000-2001.  Consequently,  the growth rate in patent  applications slowed down 
from the late 1980s up until the mid-1990s. Nevertheless, today there exists better patent 
protection through the extended breadth of invention patents following the 1988 reform. 
Indeed, the weaker pre-reform  protection in Japan was a source of recurrent complaints 
from several developed countries (Ordover, 1991; Sakalubara and Branstetter, 2001). 

2.  SLOWER PROCESSING  OF  RESIDENTS’ APPLICATIONS IN ASEAN 

The processing of invention  patent  applications from regional  residents is  also  a 
multi-year  process in ASEAN. A comparatively high processing rate of 22 per cent was 
recorded by  Singapore  (during the period  1995-2002)  and  18 per  cent by Viet Nam 
(during the period  1993-2000),  although, in the latter case, there were on average less 
than  thirty applications made per year, compared  to almost 472 applications a year in 
Singapore.  The  turnover  rate  was  even  lower  in  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines  at 
10-13  per  cent,  despite a smaller number  of applications, in  the  range of 110 to  160 
annually,  during  the  same decade. There were  more  residents’ patent  applications in 
Malaysia and Thailand (34&380  a year), and this accounts for the slower processing rate 
of 5-7  per cent during the period  1993-2002.  All these imply a waiting time of many 
years in  ASEAN, assuming that  most  of the  residents’ patent  applications are pursued 
(which is more than likely the case) and not abandoned at the application stage (wasting 
great expenses and all the pre-sunk  investment in the pertinent R&D activities).12 

Notably,  in  Australia  and  China,  there  was  a  marginally higher  processing rate 
(around  13-17  per  cent)  of residents’ applications for  invention  patents  which  were 
comparatively larger in number, averaging 9,500 and 18,200 filings a year, respectively, 
during the period  1993-2002.  Japan and the Republic of Korea also  recorded  a much 
higher turnover rate of about 34 per cent, even though these two East Asian countries 
had  to process  annually a ‘huge  volume  of residents’ applications, around  317,000  in 
Japan during the period  1993-2001  and  57,000 in the Republic  of Korea  during the 
period 1993-2002.  Chinese Taipei managed to have the highest turnover rate of 51 per 
cent from an annual filling of about 5,000. 

12  A patent  application may be withdrawn on a voluntary  basis before the mandatory  publication  (to protect 
the inventor’s trchnology or commercial secrets and lead times). It may also be abandoned because ofthe prolonged 
and costly examination  lag, because of opposition from the patent office or third parties, because of the need for 
supplementary  experimentation (and the subsequent  re-filing) or, in the case of Patent Cooperation Treaty (PcT) 
Members, because of the applicants’ choice not to enter into the national phase 20 months after international  filing 
(before May  2002)  or 30 months  (after May  2002).  There is  insufficient  and  comparable  data for the  necessary 
adjustment  of withdrawn  patents  in  deriving the  turnover  rate  between  patent  applications  and  patent  grants 
discussed  in  the  text.  Generally,  however,  the  incidence of abandoned patents  is  rather limited  in  ASEAN. The 
annual ratio of invention patents withdrawn by both residents and non-resident  applicants was about 4 per cent of 
all applications in Indonesia  during the period  1992-1993,  with  an annual  average of 18 per  cent for the period 
1992-1997  as a whole.  Indonesia joined  the PCT on 5 September  1997, and the patent applications withdrawn 
afterwards reflect, to a considerable extent, PCT-related  transactions.

Therefore, by and large, the waiting time for residents’ patent applications is much 
longer in ASEAN than in the other developing economies  of East Asia, especially when 
considering  the  substantially larger  volume  of applications in  those  economies.  This 
poses  yet  another  disincentive  to  the  propensity  to patent  and  more  generally to  IP 
creation in ASEAN because, in several ways, the examination lag before grant is similar 
to the so-called  “time in purgatory” for applicants (Popp et al.,  2003). 

O n  the one hand, patent application is a costly process, especially to innovators and 
inventors  in  low-  and  middle-income  developing  countries  in  ASEAN. Front-end 
expenses may be as much as one-third  of the total cost for patent fding, registration and 
maintenance over the typical twenty-year  life span of an invention patent. Indicatively, 
patent agents’ fees and related charges from national IP offices range from US$  11,000 
to US$  12,000 in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, to US$ 14,000 in Viet 
Nam. In comparison, the corresponding expenses are estimated at US$21,000 in Japan, 
US$ 10,000 in the United States and US$ 16,000 in the United Kingdom.13 

O n  the other hand, the  examination  lag is  a  time  of great uncertainties  to patent 
applicants because  further  and  more  costly  delays  are  possible  if  additional  data  and 
experimentation are requested  by the examining ofice or are to be supplied (through 
re-examinations  or re-filings) by  the  applicants themselves. Besides, there  may be  the 
time-consuming opposition to the patent application itself through pre-  and post-grant 
opposition by stakeholders or adversarial procedures initiated by the patent office which 
are allowed in many jurisdictions.’4 

Meanwhile,  a longer processing time  means, in effect, a  shorter protection period 
because patent enforcement is typically extendable up to twenty years from the filing (and 
not the grant) date. Besides, invention patent information no longer remains an industria1 
or trade secret and, by implication, its commercial value may be lost to competitors or 
rival inventors in the process. This is because patent applications are normally published 
within eighteen months of the filing date. As has previously been discussed in this article, 
examination lags can be due to the nature of the technologies covered by, and the extent 
and complexity of prior art ciiations made in, the patent applications themselves. 

3.  FASTER TURNOVER  OF NON-RESIDENTS’  APPLICATIONS IN ASEAN 

In  contrast to the long delays in the processing of residents’ filings for triple-test 
patent,  the  processing  of  non-residents’  applications  is  much  shorter  in  ASEAN and 
elsewhere in East Asia,. During the period  1993-2001,  the turnover was around 14 per 
’ 3   For details concerning these cost estimates, see Lam and Wattanapruttipaisan  (2004) for ASEAN, Mulcahy 
(2003) for the  United  Kingdom,  UscAo  (2002) for the  United  States and  Sakakibara and  Bransetter  (2001) for 
Japan. It  should  be  noted  that  in  the  case  of ASEAN there  are a variety  of other incidental  costs and charges.  In 
particular, the standard fee for translation into English ranges from US$ 15 per page in Indonesia to US$ 10 and 14 
per one hundred words in Viet Nam and Thailand, respectively. The translation charges are higher for complex or 
highly technical  documents. 

’4  Indeed, patenting strategies can be used in many forms and with varying degrees of subtlety to reduce the 
incentives  for  others  to  engage  in  related  and  follow-on  invention  and  patenting  activities.  These  issues  are 
examined further in Section  IV of this article. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  CREATION IN ASEAN 

635 

cent in Thailand  (with about 4,000 applications a year) and in the range of 24-32  per 
cent in  Indonesia  (3,000 applications a year), Malaysia  (4,900 applications a year) and 
the  Philippines  (2,500  applications a year).  Singapore  recorded  an  exceptionally  fast 
turnover  rate  of  62  per  cent  (against an  average  of 6,800  a year)  during  the  period 
1995-2002.  As expected, there are many variations from year to year in the waiting time 
among  ASEAN countries.  However,  a  clear  trend  can  be  seen  in  Indonesia  and 
Singapore,  where  the  turnover  rate  of non-residents’  patent  applications has  become 
much  higher  over time-an  improvement  of about  50 and  80 per  cent, respectively, 
during  the  period  2000-2001.  Meanwhile,  in the  three  other  regional countries,  the 
examination lags have remained more or less the same over the recent decade.’5 

Comparatively, the economies of East Asia also recorded a faster turnover rate than 
those  in  most  ASEAN countries,  despite  a  much  larger  number  of  non-residents’ 
applications for invention patents. During the period 1993-2002,  the rates were within 
the range of 25 per cent in China (with an average of 20,800 applications a year), 37 per 
cent  in Japan  (36,900  applications), 47  per  cent  in  the  Republic  of Korea  (24,000 
applications)  and  57  per  cent  in  Chinese  Taipei  (16,100  applications).  Again,  the 
processing of patent  applications has  become faster in recent  years when compared  to 
the beginning of the 1990s. Hence, the examination lags for non-residents’ applications 
in these three East Asian economies are also shorter than those for residents’ applications. 
However,  the  difference  between  these  two  processing  rates  is  not  that  significant, 
because the rates of turnover  for residents’ patent  filings are already remarkably high, 
especially in comparison to those in ASEAN as a whole. 

A  main  reason  for  the  much  shorter  examination  lag  for  non-residents’  patent 
applications is the availability of supporting substantive documentation from prior approvals. 
The large bulk of external patent applications have presumably been registered and granted 
elsewhere, particularly in developed countries. As such, they are backstopped with detailed 
international reports on prior art search (with listed citations with regard to novelty and the 
inventive  step).  These  applications  are  also  underpinned  by  preliminary  external 
examinations concerning the compliance of each of the fded main or independent claims to 
the globally accepted triple crite‘ria for patentability. In a way, the availabihty of such external 
documentation simpMies the work of the normally over-loaded local patent offices, as the 
substantive examination process is technically complex and very time consuming. 

Another  important  matter  for consideration  is  that  the volume  of non-residents’ 
patent applications tends to correspond to the commercial and technological interests of 
foreign patent owners in  obtaining local protection,  Within  ASEAN, such filings have 
been increasing in the  1990s. For example, the volume was rising by two to threefold 
in  Indonesia,  Malaysia, Singapore  and  Thailand  between  the  period  1993-1994  and 

~ 

~~ 

I5  Also notably, the available data  for India  indicates a processing rate  of 13.4 per cent for invention patent 
applications, averaging  10,900 per  year,  from both  residents and non-residents,  during the  period  1993-2002. 
Similar to the situation elsewhere in ASEAN and East Asia, the turnover rate has tended to be faster in recent years, 
for example reaching 20 per cent during the period 200&2002.  Nevertheless, there was a backlog of some 45,000 
applications in India during 2003. 

636 

THE JOURNAL OF  WORLD INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

2000-2002.  In absolute terms, the highest number of non-residents’ applications (in the 
range  of  40,000  to  55,000  applications) was  channelled  to  Singapore,  Malaysia  and 
Thailand for the above-mentioned  periods. Meanwhile,  Indonesia was the destination 
of 30,000  patent  filings  and  the  Philippines  of  25,000  patent  filings.  Compared  to 
ASEAN, the East Asian economies have by far been of substantially greater commercial 
and technological interest and importance to foreign inventors.  Non-residents’  fillings 
were  very  large  in  number  and  rose  quickly  over  time  to  reach  160,000 to  210,000 
applications a year in China and Chinese Taipei, just over 240,000 in the Republic of 
Korea and almost 370,000 in Japan during the period  1993-2002. 

4. 

INFLATION IN EXTERNAL  APPLICATIONS UNDER THE PCT 

In  this  context,  four  of  the  ten  ASEAN countries  are  members  of  the  Patent 
Cooperation  Treaty  (PcT) (namely Indonesia,  Philippines,  Singapore and Viet  Nam) 
administered by the WIPO. l6 An international patent application filed under this Treaty 
(with 126 contracting parties as of May 2005) has the effect of a national application in 
those PCT Member States which are designated as such in the application. Before 2004, 
the basic filing cost was CHF 650 and the designation fee was CHF 140 per country for 
a maximum of six designated countries, whilst the designation of further PCT Member 
States was free of charge. This process saves considerable time and costs associated with 
separate filings in each Member country, a necessary procedure under the Convention 
for  the Protection  of Industrial Property  (also known  as  the  1883 Paris Convention), 
currently  with  some  163  Signatory  Parties.  As  the  cost  of  designating  additional 
countries  (over  the  threshold  of six) was  free,  however,  patent  applicants tended  to 
routinely  specifjr a  large number  of countries.  Indeed,  from 2004, there  has  been  an 
automatic designation of all contracting Members in patent applications filed under the 
PCT for a combined (basic) fee of CHF 1,400. 

Consequently, the inflation in non-residents’  patent applications under  the PCT, as 
inhcated  by  the  WIPO statistics, does  not  necessarily imply  a  correspondingly higher 
interest in obtaining local prbtection  commercially or technology-wise.  Ths is because 
only  a  very  small  number  of  such  applications  enter  into  the  national phase  for  the 
necessary substantive examination  and processing by  the  local  IP  offices.  Illustratively, 
Singapore became a PCT Member on 23 February 1995 and the upsurge in non-residents’ 

‘6  The PCT is a worldwide system for the simplified filing of applications for invention patents on a multiple- 
country basis.  Negotiations  on this  system were  concluded  in June  1970 in Washington,  D.C.,  and  the  Treaty 
entered into force under  WIPO administration in January  1978. There have been amendments and modifications 
to the PCT in  1979, 1984, 2001 and 2004. The international stage of a PCT application involves an international 
prior art search, international publication and, optionally, an international preliminary examination. The time limit 
for entering the national phase (and related processes) to obtain country-specific patents under the PCT procedure 
was raised from 20 to 30 months in May 2002. This extension provides more time for patent applicants to make a 
better and more informed decision regarding the commercial potential of their invention in countries and markets 
of interest to them. The rate of applications under the PCT from developing countries has risen significantly (by an 
average ofabout two-thirds annually during the period  1998-2001,  though admittedly from a low base). However, 
applications &om these countries made up only 5 per cent of the total number of patent applications in 2001 (Lam 
and Wattanapmttipaisan, 2004).

patent  applications was  dramatic.  The  annual  number  of fhngs, which  had  averaged 
slightly under  1,600 per year in the period  1993-1994,  went  up  to 31,000 during the 
period 1995-1998.  Yet, on average, the PCT applications entering the national phase was 
only about  10 per cent of the total during the period  2001-2002  (assuming a two-year 
lag). A similar trend  was  also  talung place  in  Indonesia, which  had joined  the  PCT on 
5  September  1997. The  average annual applications  for  invention  patents  from  non- 
residents amounted to just over 3,100 during the period 1993-1997  and almost 53,300 in 
the following four years. The proportion  of PCT  applications entering the national phase 
after a two-year lag averaged around 8 per cent during the period 2001-2002.17 
c.  TECHNOLOGICAL 

TRAJECTORIES  A N D  O W E R S H I P  PATTERNS 

In the context of R&D activities, it is well appreciated that IPR regimes can play an 
important  role  in  codift.ing,  commonizing  and  hence  diffusing  knowledge  by,  for 
example, making the underlying principles and operations of the invented products and 
processes  (during  the  pre-  or  post-grant  stages)  public  domain  information.18  The 
technological  quality of a patent  can be  weighed  or assessed by  the number of claims 
and of self and/or backward citations of prior art made in the patent application. It can 
also be indicated by the patent family size, which refers to the patents related to the same 
invention  which  were  previously registered  in  various  countries,  thus  indicating  the 
degree  of cross-border  diffusion. The commercial  importance  of a patent  is  normally 
approximated  through  such  indicators  as  market  share or value, profit  rate  or profit 
accounting of the companies or the products involved, years of patent renewal, periodic 
market surveys, etc.I9 

The comparable  data  on  technological  classification  of patented  inventions  are 
publicly  available  only  for  three  countries  in  ASEAN-Indonesia,  Malaysia  and 
Singapore. They cover both  residents' and non-residents'  patents, and exist only from 
the mid-1990s onwards. Patent classifications are grouped under eight broad categories 
of the  International  Patent  Classification System (IPcs).  This is  the same as  the broad 
classification of international  trade  transactions by  the single-digit category under  the 

'7  For the sake of completeness, it should be indicated that  on becoming a Party to the PCT on  17 August 
2001, the average number of non-resident  patent applications in the Philippines jumped from 3,200 a year during 
the period  1996-2000  to almost 13,600 in 2001. On the basis  of the outcomes  experienced by  others in ASEAN, 
the volume of filings is expected to increase significantly after 2001 while the rate of entry into the national phase 
is to remain limited. In 2003, the percentage of PCT applications going into the national phase, after a two-year lag, 
was about 6 per cent. Viet Nam was the first ASEAN country to become a PCT Member (10 March  1993). Non- 
residents' applications for inventions, which had been virtually negligible, increased to an annual average of over 
14,000 a year during the period  1993-1996. 

'8  However,  in  practice,  IPRS  also  have  built-in  limitations  as  a  mechanism  for  knowledge  creation  and 
through the long lifetime of some IPRS,  through the extension of protection to dynamic 
dissemination-including 
sectors and technical IP assets and, on the other hand, through the pursuit of various patenting strategies and spoiler 
tactics (of varying degrees of subtlety). These issues and other related matters are discussed in some detail in Lam 
and Wattanapruttipaisan (2004) and in the many references cited therein. 

$9  See Popp (2003). Lanjouw and Schankerman (1999), and Trajtenberg (1999). in addition to the references 
cited therein, for detailed discussions on the quality of a patent and the related assessment of its dual technological 
and commercial value. An extensive survey and analysis of patent statistics as economic indicators can be found in 
Griliches (1990, pp.  1661-1707).

THE  

ten-category  Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). The paucity of detailed 
and comparable information implies yet another need for more micro-level research and 
case studies on the technological and commercial paths of patented  assets in ASEAN.~" 
Meanwhile,  the  data  available  show  that  three  IPCS categories  dominate  the 
technological composition of all invention patents in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. 
for  example,  categories  C  (includmg  chemistry, 
During  the  period  2001-2002, 
biotechnology  and  genetic  engineering),  G  (including  physics,  optics  and  nuclear 
engineering) and H (includmg electronics and ICTS) together accounted for 61-65 per cent 
of the patented fields of technology in the latter two countries. In the case of Indonesia, 
categories A, B  and C were  each individually similar in relative importance and had  a 
combined share of 63 per cent for the same period. Category A relates to human necessities, 
(includmg agriculture and foodstuffs, and pharmaceuticals) while category B is concerned 
with performing operations (including physical or chemical processes, and transportation). 

The three categories C, G and H  also accounted for a large share of the patented 
fields  of technology  from  residents and  non-residents  in  Malaysia  (56 per  cent) and 
Singapore (63 per cent) during the period 1995-1996.  However, movements over time 
among  these  three  individual  categories  do  not  show  any  definite  trends  in  the 
technological  trajectories  or  commercial  paths  of  IP  assets  patented  in  Malaysia and 
Singapore,21 nor do they  mirror  the  drastic transformation  in  the  economic  structure 
and merchandise trade of the major regional economies so that their export composition 
became  heavily  skewed  toward  ICT goods  during  the  1990s  (see  Section  IV  of  this 
article) .22  In particular, microelectronics became the most important single sector of FDI 
in manufacturing  from both the United States and Japan in the developing economies 
of East and South-East Asia during the  1 9 9 0 ~ ~ ~  

20  A patent  can be grouped under more than one category at this broad level of classification in only eight 
categories. For the purpose ofsubsequent research, more sub-classes are needed but, as is well known, the definition 
ofa technological area for classification purposes is as much an art as it is a science. Notably, the United States Patent 
Classification System (USPCS) contains some  460  main technological classes and around  150.000 sub-classes for 
categorization purposes. 

2'  For example, between the pen04 1995-1996  and 2001-2002,  in Singapore, the relative importance of 
invention patents in category C rose from 21 to 28 per cent while that of category H fell &om 23 to 18 per cent. 
In contrast, the relative share of invention patents in category C declined from 29 to 21 per cent in Malaysia while 
there was a concurrent increase in the relative share of category H €corn  18 to 24 per cent. Meanwhile, Penang has 
long been Malaysia's  Silicon Valley.  As  a budding satellite state of Malaysia's  planned BioValley, it has  recently 
secured overseas investment in biotechnology  (IPCS category C) worth US870 million (The Straits Times, 2004a). 
In  neighbouring Singapore,  biomedical  outputs were  worth  U S $   7  billion,  and  the  industry  attracted 
US$ 0.5 billion of overseas investment in manufacturing facilities in 2003 (The Straits Times, 2004b). 

22  ICT  products  are  defined  as  ofice  machinery  and  automatic  data  processing  equipment  (SITC 75); 
telecommunications,  sound  recording and  reproducing equipment  (SITC 76);  and  thermionic,  microcircuits, 
transistor valves, etc. (SITC 776 of the two-digit  electrical machinery SITC 77). The transformation in the export 
structure is astoundingly fast in the Philippines, with ICT goods accounting for 64.5 per cent of export earnings in 
2001,  compared  to 6.5 per  cent  during  1990. The corresponding  ratios are  51  and  28 per  cent in the case  of 
Malaysia, and 51 and 36 per cent, respectively, in Singapore. Despite its rapid expansion, the relative share of ICT 
exports is more modest in Thailand (25 and  15 per cent), and Indonesia (10.5 and 0.5 per cent). 

2'  For example, the electronics industry in these two regions accounted, respectively, for 45 and 25 per cent 
of FDI in electronics-related manufacturing and some associated research activities from the United States and Japan 
during the early 1990s (Ernst and Ravenhill, 2000). A useful and comprehensive collection of research papers on 
the electronics-based international production networks  in East and South-East Asia is contained  in Bonus et al. 
(2000). See also Ito and Krueger (2000) and Lipsey (2000).

111.  U.S. PATENT GRANTS TO ASEAN RESIDENTS 

In  connection  with  what  has  been  previously  discussed,  a  clearer  and  more 
consistent  picture  can  be  drawn  from  the  detailed  information  available  on  U.S. 
invention patents registered to entities resident or based in the regional econornie~.~~ 
In 
particular,  these  patents  are  grouped  in  accordance  with  the  very  large  number  of 
technological classes under the USPCS. 

A.  PATTERNS OF PATENTING ACTIVITIES 

Foreign  inventors  seeking  the  international  commercialization  and  diffusion  of 
their IP assets tend to take out patents in the United  States, given that country’s sheer 
size as a market for goods and services (including IP assets) and its sustained strength and 
dynamism  in  S&T and  in  R&D (Lall, 2001). Additionally,  there  are more  stringent 
standards for  patentability,  including  strict  requirements  (backed  by  legal  sanctions) 
regarding  the  full  disclosure of prior  art  in  patent  applications in  the  United  States. 
Indeed, European patent law does not have an equivalent provision  (McGarvie, 2003; 
Trajtenberg,  1999). Moreover, legal standards have created a formidable environment 
in the United States for third-party  efforts to invalidate an issued patent-patent  grants 
enjoy a strong presumption that they are “born valid” (Graham et al.,  2002). 

The  information  presented  in  Table  2  confirms  generally  the  patterns  and 
characteristics examined  in  the  previous  section  of  this  article.  Firstly,  the  absolute 
number of U S :  triple-test patents secured by ASEAN entities is relatively insignificant in 
both absolute and relative terms. At around 330 per year during the period 2000-2001, 
they  were  equivalent  to 3 per  cent  of all  patents  issued to developing  countries  and 
4  per  cent  of the  combined  number  of patents  granted  to  Chinese  Taipei  and  the 
Republic  of Korea.  In  contrast,  ASEAN-based  entities  collectively hold  more  United 
States patents than those from China, India, Brazil and Mexico. 

However, China is likely to overtake ASEAN in terms of U.S. patent ownership in 
the  coming  decade.  Firstly, there  has  been  a  steep upward  trend  in, and  a  substantial 
number  of, U.S. invention  patent grants to Chinese resident inventors for the decade 
ending 2002 (see Table 2). Secondly, large producers in China, including those in ICTS 
and  consumer  electronics, are investing heavily  to  underpin  their internationalization 
efforts.  For  example,  from  US$  8 billion  in  1988, corporate  spending  on R&D was 
estimated to reach US$  18 billion  in 2003.  Many  companies are allocating 4 to 6 per 
cent  of their  sales revenue  on  commercial R&D, compared  to  the  accepted norm  of 
5 per cent by U.S. firms. Indeed, Bill Gates, the Microsoft Chairman, noted in July 2004 
that  China  has  now  overtaken  the  United  States  as  the  center  for  mobile  handset 
technology  (Wattanapruttipaisan, 2005).

Secondly,  concerning  the  sources  of  IP  creation  within  ASEAN, Singapore  has 
rapidly  become  the  dominant  ASEAN U.S. patent holder,  with  a relative  share of just 
under one-half during the period  1991-1992  and almost four-fifths  a decade later. For 
the period  1991-2001,  it accou'nted  for almost 73 per cent of all U.S. patents issued to 
ASEAN countries,  compared  to  a  relative  share  of  13 and  7  per  cent  in  the  cases  of 
Malaysia and Thailand, respectively. Most of the U.S. patent  grants to Singapore have 
accrued to one large, homegrown corporation, as will be discussed later in this article. 
However, there  is  no information  (and hence  further  research is  needed)  in  two 
related  areas.  One concerns  the  number  of triple-test  patent  applications received or 
issued  by  ASEAN IP  offices  which,  because  of  their  perceived  commercial  and/or 
technological  importance,  are  also  simultaneously  or  subsequently  filed  for  patent 
protection in the United States, Japan or the European Union. Second, there is virtually 
no  published  information  on  the  ownership  structure,  technology  classes  and  the 
waiting  times of ASEAN residents' patents  approved  by  the USPTO and  other external 
IP offices.

Thirdly, a sharp acceleration has  recently been  observed in patenting activities by 
ASEAN residents in both local IP offices (examined previously) and the USPTO. This trend 
is particularly pronounced in the case of Singapore, whose resident inventors obtained an 
annual average of24 U.S. patents during the period  1991-1992,  but the numberjumped 
to 257 per year during the period  2000-2001.  In contrast, the trajectories of patenting 
activities are shallower in the case of Malaysia and Thailand, while the number  of US. 
invention  patents  obtained  by  entities in  Indonesia and  Philippines appeared to  have 
remained largely at the same low levels over the whole decade (see Table 2). 

In comparison, the accelerating momentum in patented assets is most striking in the 
case of Chinese Taipei and the Republic  of Korea during the  1990s. In fact, these two 
East  Asian  NIES have  become  the  world’s  major  sources  of  IP  creativity  in  several 
microelectronics  fields.  For  example,  during  the  period  1963-1 980,  Chinese  Taipei 
(with a total of 236 US. patents) was behind twenty-eight  other countries in terms of the 
number of U.S. invention patent grants. The pertinent figures for the Republic of Korea 
were  85 patents and forty-first  position.  However, in the period  2000-2001,  Chinese 
Taipei  (with 10,038 patents) moved to fourth position, behind the United  States (with 
195,680 patents), Japan (67,815 patents), and Germany (22,717 patents). Meanwhile, the 
Republic of Korea moved to eighth position (with 6,852 patents) behind France (7,860 
patents), the United Kingdom  (7,632 patents) and Canada (7,025 patents). 

B. 

TECHNOLOGICAL  AND 0 WNERSHIP CHARACTERISTICS 
During  the  period  1997-2001,  there  were  872 US. invention  patents  issued to 
residents of Singapore and 151 for Malaysia, 77 for Thailand, 37 for the Philippines and 
23 for Indonesia.  Patented  assets relating to engineering-driven  ICT  fields constituted 
over two-thirds  of the patent grants by the U ~ ~ T O  
to Singapore. The time-consuming 
and highly expensive process of trial and error in science-based R&D is mirrored by the 
small number  (just 4 per  cent) of granted  invention  patents relating to  molecular and 
microbiology,  radiation  chemistry  and  pharmaceutical  developments.  With  regard  to 
other ASEAN countries, patents in  ICT  areas were  equivalent  to about one-third  of all 
US.  patents  issued  to  institkional  and  corporate  residents  in  Malaysia  and  the 
Philippines and to 12-17  per cent in the cases of Indonesia and Thailand. 

According  to  the  USPTO patent  rules,  the  nationality  or  assigned  location  of  a 
patent  is determined by the address of the first inventor listed in the application. Thus, 
if an  invention  involves research  personnel  or  corporate  entities  resident  in  different 
countries,  then  two issues have to be  examined.  Firstly, who or where  is the principal 
source of IP creativity and, secondly, who and which stakeholders are in a position to 
reap  the  major  technological  and/or  commercial  reward  from  the  invention  itself? 
Additionally,  IP  assets  are  now  increasingly developed  OR  a  collaborative  and  trans- 
boundary basis. Again, detailed research at the firm level is needed on all these issues and 
implications,  especially  when  the  overwhelming  source  of  creativity  and  share  of 
granted IPRS remain under the effective control of TNCs and other external stakeholders. 

642 

THE JOURNAL O F  WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Meanwhile, only 7 per cent of U.S. patents registered to Singapore and during the 
period  1997-2001  are held by individuals. However, this category also includes patents 
whose ownership has not yet been  assigned or known on the patent applications or at 
the issue dates. Reflecting the dominance of corporate K&D, Japan and the Republic 
of Korea also exhibit a similarly low proportion  of individual ownership, which was in 
the  range  of  only  2  to  5  per  cent  during  the  same  period.  In  contrast,  the  ratio  of 
individually owned (plus unassigned) patents issued in the United States is much higher 
for other economies, ranging from 21 to 23 per cent for Australia and Malaysia, to 32 
to  34  per  cent  for  China,  India,  the  Philippines  and  Thailand.  Exceptionally,  the 
corresponding share is as high as 40 to 42 per cent for Chinese Taipei and Mexico. 

With regard to data on non-individual  ownership, the USPTO listing only includes 
corporate  entities  having  five  or  more  U.S.  patents.  On this  basis,  the  sources and 
technological trajectories of invention patents and technological creativity itself are least 
concentrated (or most scattered) in Thailand. For example, over the period  1997-2001, 
U.S. patents owned by individuals and corporations  (with more than five patents each) 
accounted for just 45 per cent of the total for this country, the remainder of which was 
held  by  a  large  number  of  inventing  corporations  and  institutes  with  less  than  five 
patents  each  to  their  credit  per  year.  In  addition,  U.S.  patents  issued  to  Thai  and 
Indonesian entities covered  a very wide spectrum, with most technological sub-classes 
having just one patent each during the same period. Comparatively,  the proportion  of 
U.S. patents owned by individuals and the listed corporations was 65 per cent for both 
Malaysia  and  the  Philippines  during  the  period  1997-2001.  Hence,  at  77  per  cent, 
invention and patenting activities were most concentrated in the case of Singapore. 

Generally, resident subsidiaries of TNCS have been the most important source of US. 
patents registered to corporate entities in ASEAN, except for Singapore. They are the origin 
of most U.S. patents not individually owned  in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. 
For example, during the period  1997-2001,  Malaysia had the second-largest number of 
U.S. patents (totahng 151) in ASEAN. Motorola  was  the biggest owner  of these patents 
(numbering thirty-three) in Malaysia. It also had altogether fifty-two patents from related 
subsidiaries in Malaysia and oth& countries of the region. This number was slightly ahead 
of  the  combined  number  of  U.S.  patents  owned,  for  example, by  the  subsidiaries of 
Hewlett-Packard  (forty-one patents) and Texas Instruments (forty patents) in Singapore. 
In contrast, there were seven corporations in Singapore with twenty or more U S .  
patent  grants each (all in microelectronics fields). Together,  they accounted  for 60 per 
cent ofthe 872 patents registered to this country during the period 1997-2001.  Notably, 
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (CSM), owned by and with its headquarters in 
Singapore, is the world’s third-largest  full-service facility for semiconductor fabrication. 
It is  also the most important single owner of U.S. patents, with  282 patents (or 32 per 
cent of the total). The National  University of Singapore (NUS) had another 34 patents 
(or 4 per cent ofthe total). Notably, CSM took out more patents in the United States than 
it &d in Singapore, showing the great importance of the United States as a global market 

1NTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  CREATION  IN ASEAN

in  microelectronics  products.  The  USPTO  grants  of  invention  patents  to  Singapore 
(averaging 257 a year during the period  2000-2001)  were  greater than  those issued to 
Singapore residents by the local IP o6ce (140 per year in the same period). 

Currently, there is little information with a specific focus on the invention activities 
of  subsidiaries  of  TNCS in  ASEAN, among  other  developing  regions.  The  available 
research shows that their local outsourcing activities do not contribute much to gained 
technological creativity (as opposed to diffusion) in the host countries (Dodgson, 2000; 
Lall, 2000). Further investigations are also needed as regards how decisions are made by 
TNCS in the exploitation  and allocation of the commercial benefits from an invention 
which was based on contributions from several of its subsidiaries in ASEAN and possibly 
elsewhere  (Hobday,  2000).  These  are  important  issues  to  be  considered  in  an  IP 
environment  where  the primary  consideration  is  not necessarily the patented  assets as 
such but rather the ownership and effective control of such proprietary  discoveries.25 
Research  institutions in ASEAN have not  had  a more  visible profile as  owners or 
assignees of U.S. patents despite the long history  of several premier  institutions in the 
region  (Dodgson, 2000). A notable  exception  to  this are two institutions in Singapore 
which garnered 22 U.S. patents (2.5 per cent of the total granted to Singaporeans) during 
the period  1997-2001,  in addition to the 34 patents secured by the NUS. In contrast, the 
institutional research infrastructure was particularly important in  creating and diffusing 
technologies in the  “imitation”  stage in  the  Republic  of Korea  during the  1960s and 
1970s (Lee, 2000, pp. 272-277)  .2h Comparatively, the five major business conglomerates 
(chaebols) account for some 90 per cent of all U.S. patent grants to resident entities in the 
Republic  of Korea at present.  In  Chinese Taipei,  the Industrial Technology Research 
Institute (ITRI), with 986 patents, plus seven other research institutions (123 patents) and 
the National Science Council (361 patents) were the source of  7.8 per cent of U.S. patent 
grants issued to this island economy during the period  1997-2001.27 

25  Another related area for further evaluation is concerned with a more general and larger subject, namely the 
technological  and commercial  impact of national policies in ASEAN for the promotion  ofdomestic IP creation, the 
effective  integration  of  the  technological  infrastructure  into  the  local  industrial  fabric  and  the  diffusion  and 
utilization of the IP asset developed.  Some of the issues and options involved are addressed at length in, for example, 
Yusuf  (2003) and Kim and  NelsAn  (2000), in addition to  the  numerous  references cited  in  these two  volumes. 
Wagner et al.  (2001) examine in detail the many  conditions and circumstances that  determine the S&T base  and 
capabilities in  150 economies. They  also  discuss  the  enabling  factors for  S&T  capacity  building  in  developing 
economies and for durable and diversified R&D linkages with stakeholders in technologically advanced countries. 
26  In particular, researchers in public-sector  institutions  (excluding universities) and government expenditure 
on R&D were about twice as large as those in the private sector in the Republic of Korea up until the late 1970s. 
From then on, however, the situation reversed, although, in absolute terms, the number of U.S. patents granted to 
research institutions  of the Republic of Korea is quite large compared to the case of ASEAN.  For example,  during 
the period  1997-2001, the four largest  institutes  (each with more than  100 United States patents  to their  credit) 
accounted for 5.8 per cent (901 patents) of the 15,564 patent grants received by entities in the Republic of Korea. 
Another  126 patents  (0.8 per cent of the total) were secured by  10 other research outfits. 

27  ITRI research spin-offs on wafer fabrication technologies  have been very helpful to the success of the local 
semiconductor foundries in Chinese Taipei. Strong trans-boundary  and local inter-firm  linkages and ITRI research 
have also served to sustain small-  to medium-sized  enterprises (SMES) as  the dominant player in both desk-top  and 
notebook computers on a  global scale, despite considerable  bamers in terms of technology and scale economies. 
This provides  a  sharp contrast  in these  particular segments of the  electronics  industry  to  the failure of the much 
larger and resource-rich  firms in the Republic ofKorea (Chen and Ku, 2003, pp. 38-51;  Ernst, 2000, pp. 100-140; 
Hobday, 2000, pp.143-154).  Notably, ITRI  net income (after taxes) during the period 2001-2002  averaged 4.5 per 
cent of operating revenue, one half of which was earned from fees and other services.

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 
Iv.  AN ADDITIONAL AGENDA FOR POLICY, BUSINESS AND  RESEARCH 

The  patterns  and  characteristics of  IP  creation  as  invention  patents  in  ASEAN 
reviewed  in  this  article  give  rise  to  a  slightly  more  sober  and  less  all-encompassing 
interpretation  of the striking performance  of economies and  enterprises in the region 
during  the  past  several  decades. However,  there  are  also  many  additional  issues  and 
implications for  consideration  in areas so large and complex as  innovation,  patenting, 
development  and  competitiveness.2x The  new  electronics-based  specialization  in 
production  and trade, and the substantial opportunity  costs involved, in ASEAN during 
the  1990s are examined in detail elsewhere (Lam and Wattanapruttipaisan,  2005). The 
following discussion aims to shed some light on other elements of business creativity, IP 
asset formation and technological capacity building.29 

A.  LEARNING BY DOING A,VD KNOWING 

It should  be  implicit  from  the  preceding  two  Sections of this  article that  the  IP 
assets created in the industrializing process by regional enterprises and entities in ASEAN 
are frequently gradual, sequential and tacit (or disembodied) in character.3" These assets 
often  relate  to  the  gradual  attainment  of a  minimum  level  of  operational  capability 
(know-how)  required in all applied technologies and industrial undertakings. This may 
lead to a deeper understanding  of the principles of the technologies concerned  (know- 
why)  for 
improvement  and  possibly  (albeit  not 
automatically) follow-on  or new inventions. 

the  subsequent  adaptation, 

1.  SEQUENTIAL PATHS  IN  CAPACITY  BUILDING 

Competencies gained through know-how  and know-why  are indispensable when 
and where  the  initial stages of production  and learning are largely constrained by  the 
limited availability of complementarities between tangible factors (human, physical and 
financial) and intangible inputs from the S&T base, R&D activities and formed social 

28  In  business  management,  national  competitiveness  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  the  overall  domestic 
environment  (policy,  institutions  and  infrastructure)  is  conducive  to  entrepreneurship, innovation  and  business 
initiatives. Industry-level  competitiveness is  the extent to whlch an industry or sector has the potential  for growth 
and/or  to generate an attractive return on capital. At the firm level, competitiveness  is  the effectiveness, flexibility 
and efficiency in the production and delivery of goods and services at lower costs than those of competitors or at a 
price premium over those supplied by other enterprises. 

29  There are two broad components of technological  capabilities. Technological diffusion capacity involves 
the  efficient  accumulation, assimilation and adaptation  of external  technologies  (as  embodied  in  machinery  and 
equipment or in other disembodied  transfers such as FDI and licensing agreements). Technology creating capacity 
is cumulatively based on, and derived kom, R&D activities, yields first-mover  and other market advantages and is 
a source of IP assets and licensing incomes (Dodgson, 2000, pp. 233-234). 

3"  Tacit  knowledge  and  skills  are  basically  gained  through  learning-by-doing  and  shared  through  social 
interaction. The concept of tacit knowledge was  put forward  by  Polanyi  in  1958. Audretsch  and Thurik  (2001, 
pp.  14-16)  and Senker (1995, pp.  425447) provide extensive  reviews of recent  discussions  on such  knowledge 
(including the heuristic,  subjective, sticky and internalized  variety) in comparison  to the codified,  structured and 
explicit  knowledge  whose  diffusion  relies  mostly  on the  use  of formal  and  systematic languages and  methods. 
However, it should be noted that the distinction  between  these two kinds of knowledge  is  a contentious issue in 
the literature. 

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY CREATION  IN ASEAN

networks  and  capital  (UNIDO, 2002,  pp.  102-104;  Pack,  2001;  Lau,  1998).  Such 
acquired  competencies  also  pertain  more to the  “software” aspects and the intangible 
sources  of  efficiency and  productivity  gains.  In  turn,  these  can  be  attributed  to  the 
knowledge  and  skills  accumulated  from  the  organization  and  management  of  the 
enterprise and production, from imitation and reserve engineering activities, from social 
interactions  and  received  expert  services,  and  even  from  inadvertent  leakages  and 
demonstration  effects  associated  with  protected  technologes  and  with  commercial, 
professional  or  technical  secrets  (Keller,  2001;  Kim,  1997).  Thus,  a  comparative 
commercial  advantage  will  accrue  to  firms  which  possess  or  have  access  to  the 
technological and organizational methods and processes in value creation that approach 
the local or, less often, international best practices.31 

By and large, the same competence-building processes remain useful and appealing 
to  several  newer  members  of  ASEAN which  are  presently  in  the  lower  end  of  the 
development  spectrum  and  technological fiontier  or which  are  initially takmg up  the 
economic  space  being  vacated  by  their  more  advanced  counterparts  in  ASEAN, and 
elsewhere, for that matter.3* In fact, underpinned  by  sustained factor accumulation, the 
enlargement, deepening and diversification of technological capabilities and organizational 
capital  largely  through  acquired  tacit  knowledge  and  skills  laid  a  foundation  for  the 
industrialization of the currently advanced countries in the West and then for the first and 
second generation of NiEs in East and South-East Asia  (Acemoglu et af., 2002; Lall, 2001; 
Nelson and Pack, 1999; Saito, 1998). Additionally, some ofthe tacit resources gained have 
been successhlly externalized as FDI both inside and outside Asia by a large number ofEast 
and  South-East  Asian  enterprises.  In  fact,  these  third-world  TNCS have  become  an 
important source of investment capital in their own right.33 

Higher efficiency and flexibility from cumulative learning-by-doing  and knowing 
will initially lead  to  some  measure of competitiveness and profitability, but  this is  far 
from permanent.  Firstly, the sequential and incremental  acquisition of tacit knowledge 

31  It  has  long  been  evident  that  an  organization  accumulates  and  stores  knowledge  and  skills  that  impact 
positively  on  the  process  of  value *creation.  These  knowledge  and  skills  are  intangible  and  immeasurable 
“organizational capital” which tends to be unique to the finn concerned and which can yield above-average returns 
on invested capital. This is because most other tangible production inputs are commodities whose supplies are equally 
accessible  to  all  enterprises.  It  is  thus  scarcity, rather  than  ubiquity,  that  provides  a  strategic differentiation  and 
sustained advantage in business and R&D (Carr, 2003; Lev and Radhakrishnan  2003; Atkeson and Kehoe, 2002). 
32  This  IS  because the lower the  technological  capabilities of local enterprises  (both  large and small) in  any 
particular  industrial  undertaking  are,  the  more  limited  is  the  feasible  level  of  external  technological  diffusion 
(regardless of the modes of transfer). It is, however, not within the scope of this article to exarmne the modalities 
and determinants of tacit knowledge and skills accumulation in the context of technological  transfer and diffusion 
on the supply and demand sides or of the externalized or internalized  modes  of transfer. These important matters 
have been extensively discussed, for example, in UNIDO (2002, pp. 41-58  and 9>132),  UNCTAD (1999, pp. 195-228) 
and Mansell and Wehn, (1998, pp. 6-63). 

33  For  example,  with  regard  to  ASEAN, investment  outflows  from  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Singapore  and 
Thailand  averaged  US$  4.7  billion  a  year  (one-third  of  the  inward  FDI received  by  them)  during  the  period 
1990-1995.  After a temporary downturn due to the financial and  economic crisis of 1997-1998,  those  outflows 
reached an annual average of US$8 billion (65 per cent of the inward FIX) during the period  2000-2002.  Over the 
period 1995-2001,  ASEAN was the source of 55 per cent of FDI  in Lao PDR, 30 to 33 per cent in Brunei Darussalam 
and  Myanmar, 20 per cent in Malaysia  and  Viet Nam and  10 to  14 per cent in Indonesia  and Thailand  (ASEAN, 
2003,  pp.  153-157).  Singapore  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,  Malaysia  are  the  dominant  sources  of  external 
investment from ASEAN, although the major third-world TNCS are located in East Asia. 

646 

THE JOURNAL O F  WORLD  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

and  skills  yields  diminishing  marginal  returns  with  acquired  experience  in  the 
organization and utilization of the introduced technologies. Secondly, the technologies 
under  utilization  may  be  increasingly complex  over  time  but  they  are  nevertheless 
widely shared, commonly available and mature. This can be a serious disadvantage in an 
environment  characterized by rapid technological progress and shorter product  cycles, 
intensi+ing  global competition  from the constant  emergence of lower-cost  rivals and 
imitators, and more exacting and frequently changing market demands. 

Furthermore,  it  is  equally  possible  for  enterprises  to  be  efficient,  effective  and 
flexible operationally but yet for them to remain unable to develop an internal capacity 
to  decode, differentiate, invent  and  commercialize  new products  and  processes. This 
applies  to  many  economies  where  complementary  support  services,  resources  and 
infrastructure are not adequate or are not closely interwoven  into the industrial fabric 
(Addison, 2003; Best, 2001;  Lall, 2001; Nelson  and  Pack,  1999; Mansell and Wehn, 
1998). Additionally, disembodied  knowledge  and skds are indeed critical elements of 
industrial competencies,  but  they  often do not  reach the patentable  and copyrightable 
requirements  of IPR regimes in ASEAN and  elsewhere. Besides, the  accumulation  and 
application of such knowledge and skills may contribute to some innovation activities, 
but  these  activities  do  not  necessarily  or  often  coalesce  into  a  discrete  increase  in 
invention and technological generating capabilities of the triple-test standard. 

2.  TRANSITION 

FROM ACCUMULATION  TO INNOVATION-BASED  GROWTH 

All these  account  for  the  fast-paced  but  nevertheless  patent-scarce  process  of 
development and transformation virtudy across ASEAN.34  The process itself appears to 
have been largely driven by  tangible (rather than  intangible) factor inputs. These take 
the  form  of higher  rates of accumulation  of physical and  financial resources (such as 
labour force participation, fixed capital investment, financial savings, etc.) in the region. 
In fact, an extensive controversy regarding “inspiration versus perspiration” (or the total 
factor  productivity  (TFP) debate)  erupted  in  East  and  South-East  Asia  in  the  mid- 
1990s.35 It was then followed by the contagious economic crisis of 1997-1998  and the 

34  It is true that the propensity to patent among ASEAN enterprises and other entities is constrained by a variety 
of  systemic  and  institutional  barriers.  These  are  examined  at  length  in  Lam  and  Wattanapruttipaisan  (2004, 
pp. 67-80).  May  (2003, pp.  17-20)  provides one of the few published  discussions  on some of the basic issues and 
difficulties in  reconciling  traditional  customary  laws with  the  legdative  requirements for the protection of such 
private and intangible property rights as  patents in Indonesia and, to a lesser extent, in Malaysia. 

35  In  particular,  notwithstanding the  rather  conflicting  results  and  interpretations,  productivity  gains born 
inventions  and  technological  change  are comparatively more subdued, although  not  insignificant, in  ASEAN. TFP 
share in real  GUP growth was  about four-fifths in the  United  States and two-thirds  in  France, Germany and the 
United Kingdom between the late 1950s and 1990. In comparison, TFP increments accounted for between one-fifth 
and  one-third  of the  expansion  in  real  GDP in  the  four Asian  NIES as well as  in  China,  Indonesia, Malaysia and 
Thailand during various periods from the early 1960s to mid-1990s. At the industry level, such a modest contribution 
of TFP reflects the limited additions to local value, although TFP gains tend to vary appreciably across industries. For 
further  discussion  on  these  issues,  see  Bosworth  and  Collins  (2003,  pp.  2-5  and  32-34),  Eichengreen  (2002, 
pp.  17-22);  Pack  (2001,  pp.  134-135),  Yusuf  (2001,  pp.  15-21),  Crafts (2000,  p.  22);  Nelson  and  Pack  (1999, 
pp. 424431), Chen (1997, pp.  18-38),  Sarel (1977, pp. 5-17  and 29) and The World Bank (1993, pp. 54-58).

hesitant  recovery  in  the  early  ~ O O O S . ~ ~  Largely  as  a  result,  there  is  now  a  much 
heightened  awareness  in  ASEAN that  the  “quality”  of  growth  matters  greatly.  In 
addition, the  same accumulation-based  development  model  of the  past  three  decades 
might  not  be  able  to  underpin  the  region’s historical record  of high  growth  in  the 
coming years. 

As  such,  the promotion  of higher  technological  capabilities and orbits, including 
from  invention  activities, for  ASEAN economies  and  enterprises is  a  logical  counter- 
measure  to  the  structural  problems  in sustaining high  productivity  levels as  well  as  a 
sequential progression in development strategy and policy approaches in the region.  In 
these contexts, two recent publications (co-sponsored the Government ofJapan and the 
World Bank) have emphasized the pressing needs to amplifjr technological inventions 
and  efficiency  gains  to  regain  the  dynamism  and  resilience  of  the  miracle  years  in 
East and South-East Asia  (Yusuf, 2003; Yusuf and Evenett,  2001). The books  contain 
many  useful  policy  insights  with  regard  to  the  components  of  a  national  system  of 
innovation  and  policy  and  other  drivers  for  productivity  growth  and  export 
competitiveness.  However,  in  the  main  volume  (Yusuf,  2003,  pp.  167-173),  IPR 
systems and  instruments  are  examined  much  less  rigorously and  with  less  detail than 
could be expected from their intrinsic importance as a strategic differentiator in business 
and under the TRIPS Agreement.3’ 

Most recently,  the World Commission  on the Social Dimension of Globalization 
(WCSDG) has  advocated  a  similar  strategic  response,  particularly  for  all  middle-  or 
higher-income  developing economies (thus including all the older Members of ASEAN). 
This response comprises policy- and enterprise-level efforts to sustain economic growth 
and productivity gains through on-going innovation and competence building to create 
opportunities  and  to  ensure “decent work”  for all (WCSDG, 2004,  pp.  59-64).  There 
are, however,  wide-ranging  and  complex  difficulties for  most  countries  in  ASEAN in 
shifting  from  accumulation-  to  innovation-driven  development  and  transformation. 
The persistent under-investment  in S&T and R&D in the regional economies,  except 
Singapore from the mid-l990s,  and the consequent bottlenecks and missed opportunities 
have been well documented (Lam and Wattanapruttipaisan, 2004; Yusuf, 2003; Lall, 2000). 

36  In the electronics-related  economic downturn of 2001, GDP fell by 2 per cent in Singapore and went up 
by just 0.4 per cent in Malaysia (compared to an expansion of almost 10 and 8.3 per cent respectively in these two 
countries during 2000). Regional economic recovery was subsequently constrained by the Iraq war, some persistent 
weakness in external demand for electronics products and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome dunng 
the first half of 2003. 

37  This  is  an  understandable  trade-off  given  the  admirable  breadth  covered  in  this  book.  Meanwhile,  the 
several overlaps of materials and repetitive  discussions  in  the  two volumes  provide  a refreshing reminder of the 
shared scope and  emphasis of both  publications.  For the sake  of completeness,  it should  also be  mentioned  that 
another  recent  World  Bank  publication  edited  by  Krumm and Kharas (2003) contains  an analysis of inventions 
(focusing mostly  on the Republic of Korea), copyrights  (with exclusive reference  to  the  case  of Indonesia) and 
traditional  knowledge  by  Luthria  and  Maskus  (2003, pp.  139-162).  Additionally,  an  overview  of  the  TRIPS 
Agreement together with  the various implications  on, and  options for, developing countries  can be  found in an 
earlier volume from the World Bank  (2002, pp.  129-150). However, IP systems and instruments  are not given a 
separate treatment in this overview.

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

The following discussion examines briefly some other issues  and  constraints with  due 
reference to the electronics industry in the region. 

B.  PRESSURES AND DILEMMAS 

lh’ TECHNOLOGICAL 

TRANSITION 

The new  specialization in  electronics-based production  and  trade  was  indeed  an 
economic  miracle  in  East  and  South-East  Asia  in  the  1990s. Firstly, it  represented  a 
synergic outcome whereby  fast-growing  economies  in these two  regions provided  an 
expanding (albeit cyclical) market as well as the complementary resources for each other 
(Yusuf, 2003; Borrus et  at.,  2000; Ito and Krueger, 2000; Lipsey, 2000). Secondly, the 
transformation was strikingly fast. In just a decade, the first- and second-generation  NIES 
(except  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  of  China  (SARC)) collectively 
enjoyed a higher rate of export expansion and had a greater share in world production 
of electronics products  than  they  did  in  world  trade.38  Thirdly,  East  and  South-East 
Asian  economies  were  able to penetrate  external markets which  are  characterized by 
very  intense  competition,  fast-paced  obsolescence of products  and  costly  equipment, 
plus more demanding and sophisticated consumer preferences. 

1.  LIMITED VALUE ADDITION 

The new specialization has made the composition  of manufacturing and exports in 
East and South-East Asia resemble that of many developed countries. In fact, the high- 
tech  standing and  high-tech  emphasis of Singapore and  Malaysia  are ranked  as  more 
significant than those of several industrialized economies in the world?’  Nevertheless, 
a detailed study has recently shown that the new specialization was not associated with 
any marked and sustained shifts towards high value-added activities and higher levels of 
value  addition  in  most  economies  in  ASEAN during  the  1990s  (UNCTAD, 2003, 
pp.  106-123).  This is partly because these economies have been able to move onto the 
ladder of technologcal  complexity without  first building a strong and diversified S&T 
and  R&D base  and  fostering  a  diverse  and  interwoven  nexus  of support  resources, 
industries and infrastructure. 

By and large, electronics production in most parts of ASEAN remains anchored in the 
labour-intensive and lower value-added segments. Competition is often based on the cost 
advantage of physical factor inputs rather than on technological capabilities, IP creativity 

38  Notably, the share of Icr items exported &om developing economies in East and South-East Asia reached 
almost 65 per cent of intra-regional  exports (totalling US$418 billion) in 2001, compared to less than  19 per cent 
(US$ 44  billion)  in  1985 (Ng and  Yeats,  2003, pp.  14 and  37-39).  The combined  relative share  (in  order of 
importance) of Singapore,  Maiaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia in global electronics production  was 
1.8 per cent in 1985,4.2 per cent in 1990 and 8.5 per cent In  1998. The corresponding ratios for the Republic  of 
Korea and Chinese Taipei  combined were 2.6 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 6.7 per cent (Wong, 2001, p. 4). 

39  The former are defined by Porter ef al. (1 996) as current high-tech  production and export capabilities, while 
high-tech  emphasis relates to the extent to which a nation’s exports depend on high-tech  products (Dodgson, 2000, 
p. 241). Similar and more rccent  details on electronics-related  production, value added and trade can be found in 
UNIDO (2002).

and  patented  assets  for  the  development  of  new  products  and  processes  or  of 
manufacturing  segments  of  greater  design 
innovative  design.40 
Semiconductors and electronics components of mass-produced, standard (rather than top- 
of-the-line)  consumer and industrial products, and their assembly and final testing, remain 
the focal industry in Malaysia and the Philippines; the former being among the few earliest 
players (since the mid-1960s) while the latter is a comparatively late (in the late 1980s) but 
fast-rising entrant 6om the region (UNIDO, 2002; Emst, 2000;  Hobday 2000). 

intensity  and 

Within ASEAN, the largest electronics industry in terms of employment is located 
in  Malaysia,  with  a  workforce  of  330,000  in  the  late  1990s.  Semiconductors  and 
electronics components and their testing and assembly account generally for 80 per cent 
of total output in the industry. There has been  a considerable build-up  and deepening 
of  technological  competence  as  many  electronics  firms  in  Malaysia  are  nearing  the 
cutting edge in process technologies relating to assembly, testing and related engineering 
operations (Best and Rasiah, 2003; Hobday, 2000; and Linden 2000). However, as has 
been  previously  noted  in  this  article, technologkal  creations as  invention  patents are 
lacking in Malaysia. 

As  a  whole,  the  estimated  share of value  added  from  the  electronics industry  is 
modest  in  Malaysia,  ranging  from less  than  1 per  cent  in  computers,  7  per  cent  in 
consumer  electronics  and  21 per  cent  in  semiconductors  in  2000.  Furthemore,  the 
levels of value added rose only marginally between  1994 and 2000, by  10 per cent or 
less, except in consumer  electronics  (Yusuf, 2003). Subdued productivity and limited 
value  addition  also  are  characteristic  of  the  electronics  industry  in  Thailand  (with 
output of US$  14.6 billion  in  1998), the Philippines  (US$ 7.3  billion) and  Indonesia 
(US$ 5.2 billion).4* 

The electronics industry in Singapore is  the largest in ASEAN terms of production 
value,  US$  37.8  billion  in  1998  (compared  to  US$  27.4  billion  in  Malaysia).  It 
accounted  for  about  one-third  of value  added  in  domestic  manufacturing  which,  in 
turn,  contributed  just  over  26  per  cent  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) in  2003. 
Singapore has made a succetsful transition from low-skilled, labour-intensive operations 
to a capital-intensive, skilled-labour and integrated production base. For example, CSM 
operates  five  wafer  fabrication  facilities and  has  an  equity  interest  in  another joint- 
venture  foundry  (also  located  in  Singapore),  and  a  state-of-the-art,  seventh  chip 

4')  The low levels of local value  added  from a  vanety of export-oriented  production  activities under supply 
subcontracts  or. as  part  of an  international  production  network  is  relatively well  established. However,  research 
based on enterprise-level data with regard to gained TFP and value added is much less extensive and systematic. The 
World Bank  carried out in the Spring of 2001 a large-scale  survey of 1,500 firms in China and 326 enterprises in 
six  other  economies  in  East  and  South-East  Asia.  The  results  show  generally  that  firms  within  networks  of 
international  production experienced more export growth and innovations.  However, these favourable outcomes 
were not often translated into faster growth in value addition  (relative to non-networked  firms) or into broad-based, 
direct  employment and income expansion  (Yusuf, 2003, pp. 295-305). 

41  For a  more  detailed discussion on these matters, see Tham (2004, pp. 31-33)  and Tangkitvanich, (2004, 
pp.  2G24). With  regard  to  non-ASEAN  economies,  the corresponding value of electronics output  in China was 
US$ 46.9 billion in 1998; the Republic of Korea, US$ 39.3 billion; Chinese Taipei, USS33.6 billion; Hong Kong 
SAKC, US$ 8.2 billion; and India, US$ 6.3 billion  (Wong, 2001).

fabricator  for  300-millimetre  wafers  was  coming  on  stream  in  the  third  quarter  of 
2004.42 CSM is the world’s third-leading  dedicated foundry, and commercial shipments 
totalled  722,200  wafers  (eight-inch  equivalent)  in  2003.  American  TNCS and  their 
affiliates remain the largest source of demand (about three-fifths) for its output. 

2.  COMPOUNDING  DIFFICULTIES 

With 282 US. patents or 32 per cent ofASEAN’s total to its credit during the period 
1997-2001,  CSM has been the most prolific inventor in Singapore and in ASEAN as well. 
Spending on R&D by the company has been sizable, totalling US$ 303 million  (one- 
fifth  of  net  revenue)  during  the  period  2001-2003.  There  is,  however,  insufficient 
information to permit detailed observations on the evolution of local value added or the 
productivity of R&D expenditure of the major segments of the electronics industry in 
Singapore,  including  in  terms  of  patent  yields  and  their  dual  commercial  and 
technological  significance  (Hobday,  2000).  Regarding  chip  foundries,  CSM  has 
recorded  large  net  losses,  although  a  positive  rate  of  returns  is  achieved  during  the 
upswing phase of the electronics cycle.43 

In Malaysia, few local enterprises are active in R&D for innovative products  and 
designs, hence the small number of invention patents issued to its residents by the local 
IP office (thirty-eight  for the period  200G2001) or by  the USPTO (eighty-two  patents 
for  the  same  two  years  or  151  patents  during  the  period  1997-2001).  As  noted 
previously, most U.S. patents obtained  are in the microelectronics  field and many are 
owned  by  or  assigned  to  TNC affiliates in  Malaysia. Again,  similarly  to  the  case  of 
Singapore  previously  discussed,  Malaysian  residents  apply  for  and  register  more 
invention  patents in the United  States than locally, and many of those patented  assets 
are also in the microelectronics fields. 

Meanwhile,  eight-inch  (200-millimetre)  wafers  of  semiconductors  have  been 
fabricated commercially since 2001 at the Government-owned  Silterra (in Kulim, Kedah 

42  Wafer fabrication is at the heart of chip making. The technology involved is constantly increasing in scale 
as  producers, for  example, migrate to  larger and  larger wafer size to  maxinnze the  number of chips that can  be 
produced. Etching technology i5 also getting more advanced. wlth etched width going from double- to single-digit 
micron. The recent progress from 200-millimeter to 300-mdhmeter  wafers has raised yields by  2.5 times, but the 
new fabricators  cost between  US$ 2.5  and  3.5 billion  each, compared to US$  1 to  US$  1.5 billion for  the  old 
foundries. Nevertheless, new and costly investment has to be made to accumulate and retain skills, to remain in the 
technological race and  to  maintam market shares and  networks. A  similar situation exists in  the  innovation and 
manufacturing of flat screen display panels, among other high-tech  items (Yusuf, 2003, pp.  147-148). 

43  The company was founded in Singapore in 1987 with commercial production starting two years later. It is 
largely owned by the Government and, as ofMarch 2004, it employed 3,300 employees in  11 locations worldwide. 
The CSM group achieved profitability from 1993 through to the first half of 1996 (amounting to US$102.4 million 
out of USS334.5 million of net revenue during the period 1995-1996, for example) when the electronics market 
started to deteriorate. Subsequently, there were net losses totalling US$ 343 million during the period  1997-1999 
(out of net revenue of US$ 1.5 billion), but a large net profit of US$ 245 million (or 22 per cent of net revenue of 
US$  1.13  billion)  was  realized  in  the  electronm boom  during 2000.  However, net  losses  during  the  period 
2001-2003  totalled US$ 1 .09 billion (out of net revenue of US$1.46 billlon), but the first half of 2004 saw a profit 
of  US$  17 million, with another  net  income  of  US$  10 million expected for the  third  quarter. Basic  financial 
information is accessible at the Hoover’s Website, at:  (ww.hoovers.com,;  and at  the Chartered  Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Website, at: (www.charteredsemi.com,.

State) and  1st Silicon (Sarawak State). The limited accessible information  indicates that 
sales revenue of the former was about US$68 million for the six months ending in March 
2004, while the latter facility is currently producing some  186,000 eight-inch  wafers a 
year. These two foundries are unlikely to have secured any US. patents presently, given 
the average time  lag between  filing and grant  of at least 2.5  years. Both  foundries are 
believed to have run at a loss, partly because of high start-up costs, their recent operations 
and the almost simultaneous electronics cyclical trough of 2001-2002.44 

All  those outcomes are in sharp contrast to those realized by the main competitors 
the  world’s 
largest  and  second-largest  foundries,  Taiwan  Semiconductor 
and 
Manufacturing Company (TsM) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), both 
located in Chinese Taipei. Financially, both are highly profitable.4j In addition, these two 
firms  have  been  significantly creative  and  inventive.  TSM allocated  US$  1.05 billion 
(7.4 per cent ofnet revenue) for R&D purposes during the period 2001-2003.  It secured 
1,538 (8.1 per  cent  of the  total for  Chinese  Taipei)  U.S.  patent  grants for the  period 
1997-2001.  UMC devoted to R&D about 11 per cent of net revenue  (US$635 million) 
in the early 2000s and was the holder of 1,568 U.S. patents (8.3 per cent of the total for 
Chinese Taipei) during the same five-year period. 

Another  pressure  point  is  the  significant  on-going  enlargement  of  the  existing 
capacity in dedicated semiconductor fabrication in East and South-East Asia. The process 
is  effected through conversion (for example, from the manufacture of dynamic random 
access  memory  chips), through  expansion by  the  leading foundries and  through  new 
additions (including in China and Singapore). Yet the next downturn in the electronics 
cycle is expected in 2005-2006  (the previous set backs were in the periods 1996-1997 
and 2001-2002).  Thus, there is only a small window of opportunity for exploitation, as 
sales ofsemiconductor and ICT  products are likely to peak, and sizable excess capacity and 
operating losses to emerge globally, in the second half of 2005 or early in 2006. 

3.  MARKET EXPECTATIONS AND RIVAL PRESSURES 

The performance  thresholds  expected or  required  from  all  enterprises within  and 
outside ASEAN are  trending  upward  because  of  the  constant  demands from  clients  and 
intensified pressures  from  rivals  for  ever  higher  levels  of  productivity. These  gains  are 
translated into lower prices, better quality and greater reliabllity, a larger assortment or mix 

44  There is  very limited  information on these  two  semiconductor foundries.  In the  case of 1st Silicon, the 
ectimated losses averaged about US8229 million a year during the period 2001-2002;  losses in 2003 were somewhat 
lower than those incurred in the previous year (Far Eastern Economic Review, 2004, p. 42). 

‘3  The  former,  established  in  1979 as  a  manufacturer  of  electronics  parts,  went  into  the  semiconductor 
business  in  1987 and  had  a  payroll  of some  15,000 employees  worldwide  in  2003.  TSM has  been  consistently 
profitable,  with  an  after tax  net income  of US$ 3.44  billion  from a  net  revenue  of U S $  8.55 billion  during the 
period  1994-1999,  implying a net return over sales revenue of two-fifths. In the penod 200l32003, the company 
recorded  a net  profit  of US$  8.1 billion,  equivalent  to a net  return  of almost 42 per  cent over sales revenue of 
US$ 19.4 billion.  Net income earned in the first half of 2004 amounted  to U S $  1.3 billion  (or a return of 34 per 
cent on revenue). UMC has been in operation since 1980 but entered the pure-play  foundry activities only in 1995. 
It  has  about  8,500 workers  worldwide  at  present.  Net  income  totalled  US$  2  billion  (including  a  net  loss  of 
US$ 90.3 million for 2001) or about 23 per cent of sales receipts of US$8.8 biUion during the period  2000-2003. 
The first half of 2004 yielded net earnings of US$ 0.6 billion  (equivalent to 38 per cent of sales revenue).

of  products  (or  mass  customization)  and  more  timely  and  frequent  deliveries46 The 
difhulties in responsive upgrading by suppliers and subcontractors are further compounded 
by  the  fast-paced  obsolescence  of  costly  equipment  and  acquired  slulls  due  to  rapid 
technological progress. Meanwhile, there are also shorter product cycles and fleeting lead- 
time advantages as  a  result of the speedy appearance of cheaper replications and new  or 
better products from rival companies, with the consequent shrivelling margins of profit.47 
Another  challenging dilemma lies  in  the  unrelenting  competition  from lower-cost 
production platforms both within  and outside East and South-East Asia.  ASEAN itself has 
long been  an  attractive target  for  the  relocation of substantial production  resources by 
overseas enterprises and investors. However, several subsidiaries of leading electronics TNCS 
have subsequently migrated, for example, &om Malaysia to Thdand and China in the early 
2000s and intra-  and inter-regional relocation and outsourcing are expected to  continue 
(Yusuf, 2003).48 In connection with this trend, China will emerge as a major competitor 
of ASEAN and other players in both the electronics and ICT businesses, as it has done so in 
many  other  export-oriented  economic  activities across  the  technology  ~pectrum.4~ For 

46  See Chen  and  Ku  (2003, pp.  48-50)  for  examples of nsing  thresholds  of performance  demanded from 
(largely SME) subcontracton in the notebook penonal computer industry in Chinese Taipei. With regard to prices, 
for example, the drastic fall in the cost of electronics equipments is well known, but articles of clothing one-third 
cheaper to purchase in 2002 than they were a  decade ago (The Economist, 2003). Concerning quality, firs-rank 
suppliers of automotive parts and components in Thailand are normally joint ventures (about 380 enterprises), while 
second-tier  subcontractors  are mostly locally  owned SMES (about 1,000 firms). All  of them now  have to comply 
with a stipulated defect ratio of 20 parts pcr million  (ppm), compared to the previous ratio of 100 ppm. This much 
tougher quahty standard implies virtually zero defects and a  100 per cent quality control check. At thc same time, 
the target for supply cost reduction is  set at  15 to 25 per  cent over the medium  term  of two to three years. The 
benchmarks  for  cost  reduction  exercises are  the  free-on-board  pnces  of similar products in  the  world  market. 
Additionally,  the  demand  for just-in-time  procurement  has  necessitated  up  to  eight  deliveries  (instead of two 
previously) a day to gradually eliminate inventories altogether at the assembly line (Tangkitxanich, 2002, pp. 7-8). 
47  Perhaps the most astounding example of the eroding advantage of fmt movers is the unprecedented drop 
in  the  cost  of computing  power  of a  silicon  chip, whose  accelerating  processing speed  is,  in  fact, ahead  of the 
schedule  in Moore’s law  (Jovanovic and Roucceau,  2002).  Shorter product  cycles are also apparent in  numerous 
dynamic  industries  within  the  broad  technology  class  of  microelectronics  as  well  as  in  mature-technology 
manufactures  rmging from  fashion garmentc  and  high-end  sport  shoes  to  motor  vehicles  and  other  consumer 
durable  goods  (Agrawal and  Gort,  2001). However,  a  compensating  factor  is  the  higher take-up  rates  for new 
products to reach mass-market status. This 15 atrnbutable to thc steep falls in unit prices as a result of (mutually self- 
reinforcing)  technological  advance,  economies  of  scale  and  ccope  in  production  and  agglomeration,  plus  the 
increasing availability of cheaper substitutes from lower-cost  producers  from mostly developing countries. 

48  These trends  and  movements in intra-  and extra-regional  outsourcing and  relocation  are not  always the 
“races to  the  bottom”,  as  observed  by  Daly  (2000). This  is  a  process whereby developing economies that  get  a 
competitive advantage in international  trade and inward  investment are often those which have a poorer record of 
internalizing all social and environmental costs ofproduction  and trade into the prices of their products and services 
and into the incentive packages to attract FDI projects. Daly’s view  IS,  of course, an over-sweeping  generalization, 
as  there  is  currently  little  empirical  evidence  in  support  of  his  hypothesis  (Frankel,  2003,  p.  21).  There  are, 
nevertheless, examples of competitive offers which lead to a lower domestic  living standard while  doing nothing 
to improve productivity (UNIDO, 2002, p. 11 1). However, at the same time, the precautionary  principle applied in 
some developed countries can well lead to a race  to the top (Otsula et al., 2003). 

4’)  These range from sports and dress shoes, garments, consumer video equipment and wooden furniture to 
musical instruments  (such as pianos and guitars). Regarding the electronics industry, the huge domestic market for 
semiconductors in China, estimated at US$  88 billion  currently, holds much potential  for flexible investment  in 
foundry  capacity  as  well  as  scale  economies  (Far Eastern  Economic  Review,  2004,  pp.  4243). China  is  also 
expected  to be globally competitive in motor vehicle exports in the next few years, given an expected production 
scale of about 4.5 million cars and trucks largely for internal consumption in 2004. In fact, the country was already 
exporting motor vehicle  parts  and components worth US$ 4.7 billion  in 2003. There was, for example,  the first 
shipment to Australia in November 2003 of premium-priced  Volkwagen  Polos made in Shanghai (Fortune, 2004). 
See OECD (2002) and UNCTAD and ICTSD (2002, pp. 141-64)  for more details of China’s competitive strength, and 
Wattanapruttipaisan  (2003 and  2005)  for  discussions  of  the  likely  areas  of complementarities  and  competition 
between  China and ASEAN in home and third-country markets.

example, the country’s wafer fabricating capacity consists of five foundries with an output 
ofjust under one-tenth  of global capacity at present. This could double in size through the 
planned implementation of joint-venture  projects (for example, with  TSM from Chinese 
Taipei) during the period 2005-2006. 

4.  STEEPER LEARNING CURVES AND STRATEGIC PATENTING 

There is yet another set of difficult challenges to the construction of technologcal 
diffusion  and  creating  capacity virtually across  ASEAN. To begin  with, technological 
progress is now increasingly based on existing plus newly found discoveries from a host 
of related as  well  as  diverse sectors and  processes (Anton  et  al.,  2001). Coupled  with 
rapid technological  change  (especially in the electronics industry), all these discoveries 
mean greater complexity  and time  in learning and absorption  and a  constant need for 
new  and  more  costly  specialist skills  and  expertise.  Thus,  productivity  growth  and 
export competitiveness are unsustainable without  interactive  investment  in education, 
training and R&D. However, the payoff to that investment will depend heavily on what 
precise products  and processes are  targeted  Uovanovic  and  Rousseau,  2002).  Market 
signals and  technological  changes can provide  firms and  stakeholders with  the  inputs 
they need, but business experience and “savvy” count, t00.5”  Failure is often disastrous 
financially, given the typically significant investment required  (relative to capitalization) 
and the short-term  horizons of market valuation of listed firms. 

In addition, speedy and self-reinforcing techno-scientific progress means that many 
new products  and  processes are likely to overlap with  the  technologies  previously or 
simultaneously  developed  by  external  parties.5’  This  poses  yet  another  difficulty  to 
ASEAN inventors because the stock of existing and newly gained proprietary knowledge 
can be deployed  and applied in such a way as  to maximize the technological lead and 
commercial value for the holders of IP assets.  In fact, defensive and strategic patenting 
activities have  been  on  the  rise  in  the  United  States, contributing  to  the  so-called 

5”  Samsung Electronics (and for that matter, LG  Electronics) has taken a pole position  tcchnologically and/or 
has also enjoyed strong pricing power over major rival corporations in the world in several top-of-the-line  products 
in consumer electronics. This is due to astute foresight in making contranan decisions to invest huge resources for 
the  commercialization  of  newly  developed,  advanced  technologics  in  plasma  flat-screen  display  panels  in  the 
aftermath  of the  1997-1998  financial  and  economic  crisis  in  East  and  South-East  Asia  (Yusuf, 2003, p.  148). 
Comparatively, the  Sony  Corporation  was  itself the  inventor  of consumer electronics  and  is  the  world’s largest 
consumer electronics firm, with 5,475 U.S. patents dunng the penod 1997-2001.  Sony’s market capitalization was 
more than twice that of Samsung Electronics in 2000 but dropped to 52 per cent (US$ 38 billion) of Samsung’s as 
of February  2004: Global sales of Samsung, at  US$ 50.2 billion  in 2003, were about four-fifths  of Sony’s, but the 
former recorded a much higher profit margm over sales, 12 per cent, compared to less than 2 per cent in the case 
of Sony. In May 2004, Samsung Electronics was ranked by Forbes magazine at the 45th position among the world’s 
2,000 leading  companies.  Sony  Corporation  was  ranked  82nd  and  Matsushshita Electric  Industrial  Company  at 
415th.  The latter is the world’s second-largest consumer electronics firm (with global revenue of US$ 62.6 billion 
but with a net loss of USS 145 million in 2003) and had secured 5,284 U.S. patents during the period  1997-2001. 
See Forbes (2004). 

5’  Pertinent to this discussion are the legal battles between Sony and Eastman Kodak relating to digital camera 
technologies, and between Fujitsu and Samsung (the world’s largest and second-largest producers) over technologies 
in (flat-$creen) plasma display panels. The global sales target of Samsung for these panels was USS 7.1 billion in 2004.

“patent paradox”.52 The former  can be used  to extend the life of the  original patents 
(evergreening practices). Strategic patenting can be deployed to cover inventions which 
are not ready for commercialization  but which, nevertheless, have to be protected  for 
two reasons. One is  to block  or to make  it more  difficult or costly for other firms to 
invent  around  the  related processes and  products.  The other  reason  is  to  prevent  or 
discourage  other  firms  from  engaging  in  follow-on  inventions  later  on  (Hall  and 
Ziedonis, 2001; Allison and Lemley, 2OOO).53 

The electronics industry  (both hardware  and  software), as  are the biotechnology 
and pharmaceutical industries, is  characterized by frequent litigation relating to patent 
and other  IPRS. This requires, in turn, the sustained allocation of sizable financial and 
management  resources for precautionary  purposes and for legal defense irrespective of 
the validity of infringement  claims. The substantial transaction costs involved are likely 
to be affordable only by  the largest corporations in ASEAN, and these are relatively few 
in number.54 As an option, many electronics firms often require access to a “thicket” or 
combination of IPRS in order to legally invent, produce and then sell the products  and 
processes concerned. However, given the highly competitive environment  within  the 
industry, there is no guarantee that the needed technologies or additional licences could 
be obtained at all or could be secured on reasonable cominercial terms. 

Another  option is  not  to patent; hence  the patent  paradox  noted  earlier. In fact, 
firms  in  litigation-prone  industries  or  with  relatively  high  litigation  costs  (those  in 
biotechnology and pharmaceuticals in particular) are less likely to seek patents in those 
sub-classes of technology in which there is a likelihood of prolonged opposition or there 
have been many damage awards to rivals for patent infringements (Allison and Lemley, 
2000; Lichtman et al., 2000). 

A third possibility is to form, deepen and diversify R&D alliances with cross-border 
entities, including TNCS. Such linkages were  evident in the automobile industry from 
the  early  1980s and,  more  recently,  in  the  new  and  dynamic  fields  of  technology, 
especially  electronics  and  biptechnology  (Walsh,  2003;  Liu  and  Chen,  2003; 

52  Driven  by  rapid  technological  change  and  shorter  product  life  cycles, semiconductor firms tend  to  rely 
more heavily on lead time, secrecy and better manufacturing and design capabilities rather than on patents to recoup 
R&D investment. Nevertheless,  there has been a sharp rise  in the  number  of patents  relating  to semiconductors 
since the early 1980s. Defensive or strategic patenting activities are among the main reasons behind this paradox. 
53  In particular, disclosure can be strategically made in such a way that it signals to rivals how far behind they 
are technologically or how limited the expected commercial value of the inventions may be. Likewise, information 
can also be disclosed in great obscurity. Notably, a typical patent application in the United States is twenty to forty 
pages. Figures quoted by UNIIP show that during 2000, for examplc, the WIPO received thirty applications of over 
1,000 pages while several others were as long ac  140,000 pages (UNDP, 2002, p.  103). Some biotechnology patents 
carry as much  as  160,000 pages  of information (Forbes, 2002). Litchman  et  a/. (2000, pp. 2180-2189)  provide  a 
detailed analysis of the implications of the prior art test in disclosure. 

54  In  particular,  although  the  rate  of  patent  litigation  remained  largely  unchanged  in  the  United  States 
between  1985 and 2000, the absolutc number ofissued patents morc than doubled (from 71,700 to 157,500), thus 
implying  a higher number  of litigated claims and  counter-claims.  Meanwhile, the cost of litigation is  typically  in 
the range of US$  1 to US$3 million per suit, and US$ 0.5 million per claim at issue per party. The average length 
oftime for resolution of patent suits at the level of a district (trial) court is about 31 months. See Graham ef a/. (2002) 
for further details.

Trajtenberg,  1999; UNCTAD, 1999). Nevertheless,  strategic linkages and  networlung 
can be a catch-22 situation for countries with a limited and shallow S&T and R&D base, 
including virtually all those in ASEAN. The sustainability of trans-boundary collaboration 
is essentially a two-way process. It depends very much on the prior availability of strong 
technological capabilities among the firms and institutions involved plus a critical mass 
in the relevant fields of S&T. This is the age-old issue of mutual trust, reliability, quality 
and timeliness in delivery among partners and collaborative stakeholders (Wagner et al., 
2001; UNCTAD, 1995). 

V.  CONCLUSION 

The fast-paced growth and transformation of most ASEAN economies has not been 
mirrored by a commensurate record of IP creativity as invention patents over the past 
several decades. The volume of patented  assets owned by ASEAN residents locally or in 
the  United  States  is  insignificant in  both  absolute  and  relative  terms.  This  contrasts 
sharply  with  the  substantial  amount  of  IP  creations  and  technological  capabilities 
achieved  by  Chinese  Taipei  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  within  largely  a  decade. 
However, Singapore’s recent technological dynamism, driven largely by  discoveries in 
microelectronics  fields and by  a  major  local enterprise,  constitutes a partial  exception 
within  the  region.  As  such,  ASEAN economies  still  have  a  long  way  to  go  in 
technological  capacity building and transformation  to ensure greater and more diverse 
value addition as  well as to attract, anchor and internalize a larger range of high value 
added activities. 

This strategic transition in technological  (diffusion and creating) capabilities has 
to be undertaken as part and parcel of ASEAN economies’ constant efforts to forge new 
bridgeheads of growth, to attain deeper trajectories of competitiveness and to raise and 
sustain high rates of return on human and physical capital in the process. Development 
and  comparative  advantage  among  interdependent  economies  and  enterprises  are 
increasingly based on knowledge, driven by invention and innovation and steered by 
on-going  learning.  As  also  evident  in  the  preceding  discussion,  the  imperative  for 
technological  transition  in  ASEAN has  become  even more pressing given  the  multi- 
dimensional  challenges,  with  all  their  attendant  pressures  and  dilemmas,  to  be 
managed  and  resolved  by  business  and  government  in  the  region.  The  transition 
process  can  certainly  be  facilitated,  and  policy  design  and  business  decisions  better 
made, through  a clearer understanding  of the patterns  and characteristics of creativity 
and  patented  assets, including  their  determinants,  on both  the  supply  and  demand 
sides within ASEAN. 

At present, there is  virtually no analytical information on the  cost efficiency and 
productivity  of R&D allocations, on the propensities to patent  (given the low turnover 
rates and other structural and transaction costs in patenting)  and on the technological

and  commercial  significance of  domestic  or  U.S.  patents  held  by  ASEAN residents. 
Another profitable field for research, with important  implications for government  and 
business, concerns the invention activities of regonal enterprises and TNC subsidiaries 
and the ways patented assets are deployed  and protected  by them. Moreover,  the role 
of research institutions as a source of domestic IP creativity and transferable technologies 
to  local industries is  an  important  area  for further  enquiry  in  its own right.  Lastly, a 
general  and  larger subject  is  the  convergence  or  otherwise  of  the  social and  private 
values  of patents  and  other  IPRS,  given  the  significant and  multi-faceted  divergences 
among,  as  well  as  within,  economies  in  ASEAN. All  these  highlight,  once  again, the 
richness  of  the  outstanding  agenda  for  further  attention  by  all  the  concerned 
stakeholders both inside and outside the region.
