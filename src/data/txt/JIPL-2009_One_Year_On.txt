Obvious to try, one year on
Paul England*

forty years

During the last
the volume of high-tech
research has increased enormously, especially in the ﬁelds
of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The resources com-
mitted to research are enormous, because the potential
rewards in world-wide markets are so great. Competition
is ﬁerce. In this climate “obvious to try” has tended to
take on a life of its own as an important weapon in the
armoury of those challenging the validity of a patent.

Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe—Angiotech

An increasing feature of the global pharmaceuticals
market is the competition between ‘originator’ pharma-
ceutical companies (those who research and develop
new drugs to market), and ‘generic’ companies (those
who market their own, ‘me-too’, non-branded copies of
those drugs in competition with the originators). In
order to compete with an originator, the generic must
ﬁrst seek to invalidate the patent(s) protecting the drug
it is interested in, either at the patent ofﬁce of regis-
tration or in the courts of the country in which the
patent is registered. Patents can only protect ‘inventive’
products and processes; one way for the generics to
have a patent revoked is to show that it is not inven-
tive. For several years, the originators have complained
that the generics ﬁnd it too easy to invalidate their UK
patents in this way. English judges, they say, have been
making it too hard to demonstrate inventiveness, stack-
ing the odds in favour of the generics.

This matters to originators because their patents are
the result of highly expensive research, often involving
the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars. Thus,
they argue that they should be entitled to a greater level
of protection against the me-too drugs coming from
generics which have not had to invest similar resources
and can therefore undercut their prices. Indeed, invalida-
tion of many patents has led to damaging erosion of the
originators’ markets in recent years. It has also placed
pressure on them to pour resources into developing new
drug candidates to ﬁll development pipelines, without
having secured sufﬁcient reward for the investments
made in their existing portfolio. In contrast, generics say
that they are merely removing weak ‘life-cycle’ or ‘ever-

Key issues
† When patents are applied for in the UK IPO, or
subject to a revocation proceedings for lack of
inventive step, the comptroller of patents and the
UK courts must address the question of what is
obvious and if there are any approaches that can
help them in the particular factual circumstances.

‘obvious-to-try’ test, but this has been formu-
lated in a number of different ways by the courts
over the years, some which make it easier to
show obviousness and some harder.

An August 2007 article in this

‘Saint
Gobain—patron of pharmaceutical patentees’, reviewed
the key authorities behind the development of the test
most often applicable to patents of the formulation
kind: the so-called ‘obvious-to-try’ test. These auth-
orities culminated in Saint Gobain1 and Angiotech,2
heard in the Court of Appeal. The ﬁndings of Jacob LJ
in Saint Gobain promised much for patentees in all
technology areas by coining a somewhat easier version
of the obvious-to-try test for those trying to demon-
strate the inventiveness of
their patents. However,
this issue was then left hanging by the same judge in
Angiotech, which followed it shortly afterwards. The
subject was clearly in need of review by the House of
Lords. One year on and, sure enough, things have
moved on. The House of Lords has ﬁnally addressed
the issue of obviousness and, in particular, the correct
approach to asking whether an invention was ‘obvious

to try’. This article assesses what the Lords say about
this test and its implications for the inventiveness
handle and, in particular, pharmaceutical patents.

How the ‘obvious-to-try’ test ﬁts in
Where does the issue of ‘obvious to try’ ﬁt into patent
law? In short, Articles 52(1) and 56 of the European
Patent Convention 1973, as implemented by sections
1(1)(b) and 3 Patents Act 1977, provide that an inven-
tion shall be taken to involve a patentable inventive
step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art,
having regard to any matter which forms part of the
state of the art. The established approach to obvious-
ness was famously set out in Windsurﬁng.3 However,
that case only provides the correct way in which the
question of obviousness should be approached. It does
not provide a means by which the essential question of
‘what is obvious?’ may itself be assessed. The courts
have deliberately avoided trying to deﬁne ‘obvious’
so that
the essential statutory test should not be
diminished. Thus,
in Norton
Healthcare4 stated:

the Court of Appeal

No formula should be substituted for the words of the
statute. In every case, the Court has to weigh up the evi-
dence and decide whether the invention was obvious. This
is the statutory task.

However, perhaps inevitably, the UK courts have devel-
‘sub-tests’ to assist in determining the
oped several
essential statutory question of whether a patent
is
obvious (while being careful not to let these replace the
essential question). One such test, applied in appropri-
ate circumstances, is the obvious-to-try test which is
particularly applicable where the inventor at the pri-
ority date had a number of known technical options
that might, with hindsight, have been tried in coming
to his invention. This is why this sub-test is often
applicable
evergreening
inventions, where a known drug has been reformulated
using one or more of a list of other drugs, excipients,
salts, or dosage, crystal or hydration forms: were all the
potential options on the list obvious to try at the time
the patent was ﬁled?

to formulation and other

An obviousness ‘hurdle’ set at different
heights
The obvious-to-try test has been formulated in various
ways over the years. The manner of formulation affects

the ease with which a patent can be attacked for
obviousness—what might be described as the height at
which the obvious-to-try hurdle is set. A lower hurdle
makes it easier to invalidate a patent for lack of inven-
tive step; a higher one, more difﬁcult. Those critical of
the UK courts’ approach to obviousness complain that
the hurdle has been set too low. The key to where the
hurdle is set is to look at how the obvious-to-try ques-
tion is qualiﬁed by expectations that the invention
being tried will be successful. Three formulations illus-
trate the varying ways in which this has been done.
First, the original
formulation from Johns-Manville’s
Patent:5

the person versed in the art would assess

1. It is enough [to show the invention was obvious to try]
that
the
likelihood of
to warrant actual
trial . . .

success as

sufﬁcient

This has similarly been expressed in the form of asking
whether the invention was obvious to try with a
‘reasonable expectation of success’. In other words,
there must be a consideration of whether the invention
was likely to be worth it.

Before looking at the next formulation, one should
note a second aspect, which is relevant to the way in
which the UK courts came to address the need for
some expectation for success. Laddie J in Brugger6
thought that the number of routes that may be tried
when applying the Johns-Manville’s test has no impact
on obviousness where the resources available and the
commercial interests at stake might compel the skilled
person to try them all:

. . . if a particular route is an obvious one to take or try,
it
is not rendered any less obvious from a technical
point of view merely because there are a number, and
perhaps a large number, of other obvious routes as well.
If a number of obvious routes exist it is more or less
inevitable that a skilled worker will
try some before
others. The order in which he chooses to try them may
depend on factors such as the ease and speed with which
they can be tried, the availability of testing equipment,
the costs involved and the commercial
interests of his
employer. There is no rule of law or logic which says
that only the option which is likely to be tried ﬁrst or
second is to be treated as obvious for the purpose of
patent litigation.

This observation appeared to undermine the require-
ment

in circumstances where one has practically

limitless resources,7 everything may potentially be tried
with little fear that much of it will result in no success
at all. This statement of Laddie J becomes relevant when
looking at the House of Lords decision in Angiotech,
which is discussed later. However, in the second of the
example formulations
taken here a hard line was
espoused by Pumfrey J that has a similar practical
effect, that the obvious-to-try test need not be qualiﬁed
by any motivation of success at all:

2. Evidence that the skilled person would be led to try
something because there was a reasonable expectation that
it would produce a reasonable result established one poss-
ible route to ﬁnding obviousness. But if it was obvious to
try that thing for other reasons, there need be no super-
added requirement that there should also be some expec-
tation of success.8

Pumfrey J took the same approach in the ﬁrst instance
decision on Angiotech. This
is a lower hurdle to
showing that a patent is obvious, since it could cover
an unlimited range of activities and experiments with
no regard to whether there was any apparent likelihood
that they would be worth trying. Nonetheless, this
seemed more or less the measure of obviousness that
had established itself in the UK courts.

Then came Saint Gobain,

in which the Court of
Appeal took a dramatically different, quite unexpected
position. In his judgment, Jacob LJ posed a third for-
mulation when he said of the question of obvious to
try:

3. Mere possible inclusion of something within a research
programme on the basis you will ﬁnd out more and some-
thing might turn up is not enough. If it were otherwise
there would be few inventions that were patentable. The
only research which would be worthwhile (because of the
prospect of protection) would be into areas totally devoid
of prospect. The ‘obvious-to-try’ test really only works
where it is more-or-less self-evident that what is being
tested ought to work.

This radically different approach to the obvious-to-try
test set the hurdle of showing what is obvious much
higher. For an invention to be obvious it had to
be ‘self-evident’ from the outset that it would work.
This was good news for patentees and it showed that
the Court of Appeal shared their concerns that it is too
easy to show obviousness. But how closely would it be
followed? Not closely, as it turned out. While afﬁrming
it as a general proposition in the appeal of Angiotech,
for reasons explained below, Jacob LJ felt he could not
apply it to the facts of that particular case. The issue

had become messy and it was high time the House of
Lords cleared it up.

Lundbeck
The ﬁrst clue as to how the Lords might treat the issue
in Angiotech came in another Court of Appeal decision,
H. Lundbeck A/S v Generics [UK] Ltd and others.9 Here,
Lord Hoffmann took the unusual step of coming down
from the Lords in order to hear the case with Lords
Justice Smith and Jacob.

Lundbeck concerned escitalopram, an enantiomer of
the racemic compound, citalopram. Both the escitalo-
pram compound and a method for making it (using
the ‘diol’ route) were claimed in the patent in suit.
Among other things,
the Court of Appeal had to
address whether the diol route was obvious. The evi-
dence was that there were other potential methods of
isolating escitalopram available that might have been
tried to effect
the
question was characterized by the ﬁrst instance judge
and the Court of Appeal as a case of the obvious-to-try
type.

separation. Consequently,

the

Lord Hoffmann said:

[the Judge] said: ‘this is a case in which it is said that the
method of claim 6 was one which is obvious to try’. He
then cited from Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc v Conor
Medsystems [2007] RPC 20, which represents the Court’s
last word on the extent to which the notion of some step
being obvious to try is helpful
in deciding whether an
invention is obvious. The judge then summed up (at para-
graph 72) the current state of the law:

The question of obviousness must be considered on the
facts of each case. The court must consider the weight to
be attached to any particular factor in the light of all the
relevant circumstances. These may include such matters as
the motive to ﬁnd a solution to the problem the patent
addresses, the number and extent of the possible avenues
of research, the effort involved in pursuing them and the
expectation of success.

No criticism has been made of this statement of prin-
ciple and in my opinion the judge proceeded to apply
it correctly to the facts of the case. In particular, he
took into account, ﬁrst, that there were ‘a number of
avenues of research’ open to the skilled man seeking a
solution to the problem and that therefore he would
not have taken the diol route unless satisﬁed there was
a ‘real prospect’
the necessary reaction would
work.

So,

the test endorsed in this case was not self-
evident success but a ‘real prospect’ of success. The
obviousness hurdle had moved down from Saint
Gobain, but apparently not by much. Was this a reﬂec-
tion of the facts in this case, or a more general state-
ment of principle? The issue was soon addressed again
by Lord Hoffmann, this time sitting in the House of
Lords in Angiotech.10

Angiotech
The patent in suit
The patent at suit in Angiotech concerned stent tech-
nology used in the treatment of angiogenesis. Angio-
genesis is the excessive growth of small blood vessels
causing arteries to become constricted or ‘stenosed’.
This condition can result in angina and heart failure.
This problem can be alleviated to a certain extent by
stents, small, tubular wire cages that are pushed into
the blocked artery to hold it open. However, stents
cannot prevent the further growth of tissue and associ-
ated blood vessels by angiogenesis into the structure of
the stent itself, causing further closing of the arteries—
a problem called restonosis.

To solve this problem, Angiotech’s patent claimed
the use of a stent covered in an anti-angiogenic factor,
in particular taxol, one of a number of known drugs at
the priority date of the patent that could prevent cell
division and thus angiogenesis. Importantly, the patent
did not contain any proof that the stent coated with
taxol would actually work to treat restenosis. Conor
sought revocation of the patent on the basis that it was
obvious in the light of prior art that disclosed an
unspeciﬁc, drug-eluting stent for local delivery of ‘anti-
replicate’ drugs that might reduce restenosis. At ﬁrst
instance, Pumfrey J agreed with Conor and revoked the
patent as obvious. This decision was upheld on appeal.
Jacob LJ stated that:

to name one ‘other’ anti-replicate which, on the
Just
information given in the patent is no more and no less
likely to be found to work in practice is not to make an
invention.

Angiotech was given leave to appeal
to the Lords
where, due to a settlement in relation to the UK pro-
ceedings, the Lords invited the Comptroller General to
stand in place of the respondent and present the argu-
ments against the validity of the patent. There were
two key issues on which the Lords focused.

& others [2008] UKHL 49.

invention of

What is the invention?
Establishing the actual
the Angiotech
patent was clearly necessary before considering its
obviousness. Angiotech argued that inventiveness lay in
the claim that the taxol-coated stent would have the
property of treating restenosis. However, the respon-
dent sought to argue that, since the patent did not
show that taxol would actually work in reducing reste-
nosis,
it was nothing more than an idea that taxol
might work. Ideas as such, they said, cannot form the
basis of an invention. Hence, the patent taught no
more than that taxol was worth trying, and added
nothing to existing knowledge.

to treat or prevent

The Lords agreed that a patent must not be granted
for an idea which is mere speculation, unsupported by
any disclosure in the speciﬁcation. But in their view,
the speciﬁcation did contain support for a claim to a
taxol-coated stent
restenosis.
Although the speciﬁcation did not provide any evi-
dence proving that taxol would actually reduce resteno-
sis, the Lords pointed out that there is no requirement
in UK patent law for it to do so: obviousness should
not be subject to a different test according to the
amount of evidence the patentee presents that his
patent will work. In the Lords’ view, this argument was
an illegitimate amalgam of the requirements of inven-
tiveness and either insufﬁciency or support, or both.
Instead it was held that the speciﬁcation need only pass
what Lord Hoffmann referred to as a ‘threshold test’ of
disclosing enough to make the invention plausible, as
this patent did. And the inventive step should instead
be identiﬁed purely by reference to the patent claims.
A failure to appreciate this had, according to the Lords,
led the Court of Appeal to assess obviousness incor-
rectly. In this case, the correct question was therefore
whether it was obvious to use a taxol-coated stent to
treat or prevent restenosis as was claimed in the patent,
not whether it was obvious that taxol (among other
products) might have the effect of treating restenosis (as
yet to be proved) and was therefore worth testing to
ﬁnd out.

Obvious-to-try
It was because Jacob LJ had failed to appreciate that
the court should look to the claim and disregard a lack
of proof that he had not applied his obvious-to-try for-
mulation from Saint Gobain. Jacob LJ had thought it
inappropriate to measure obviousness by a test that
looked to likelihood of success, where success had not

actually been shown. The Lords, however, had freed
themselves from this restriction. Instead, they could
now ask themselves what
the correct approach to
the obvious-to-try test is in this case, as in any other.
They stated that
the
alternative posed, but not applied, by Pumfrey J at ﬁrst
instance:

formulation was

the correct

is the patent vulnerable only if it can be shown that the
skilled person would have an expectation of success sufﬁ-
cient to induce him to incorporate taxol in a drug-eluting
stent . . . ?

If Pumfrey J had applied this test, the Lords felt sure he
would have found the patent
to be non-obvious.
However, it seemed that the Lords did not want to
straitjacket themselves with a single, rigid expression of
the test. Instead, they swiftly moved on to paraphrase
the correct approach under the authorities as saying
that ‘obvious to try was useful only in a case in which
there was a fair expectation of success’. A ‘fair expec-
tation’ is not intended to be an abstract measure, as
how much expectation would be needed would depend
on the particular facts of the case. In this respect,
Lord Hoffman endorsed the statement of Kitchin J in
Lundbeck at ﬁrst instance:11

The question of obviousness must be considered on the
facts of each case. The court must consider the weight to
be attached to any particular factor in the light of all the
relevant circumstances. These may include such matters as
the motive to ﬁnd a solution to the problem the patent
addresses, the number and extent of the possible avenues
of research, the effort involved in pursuing them and the
expectation of success.

So has the House of Lords merely added a number of
new formulations to the family of obvious-to-try tests?
The Lords appear to have been unwilling to set any
kind of test that should be regarded as a strict formula,
in keeping with the court’s reluctance to replace the
statutory test. But, what Lord Hoffmann is saying may
actually be quite simple: when asking if an invention is
obvious to try, one should consider if there was an
‘expectation of success sufﬁcient to induce’ the skilled
man to do the work. This looks very much like the
original Johns-Manville’s test, above, except that the
Lords add that the expectation must be a ‘fair expec-
tation’, which must be assessed ‘holistically’ on the
basis of all the circumstances.

Clearly, the requirement to have regard to expec-
tations of success in this way is a large move away from
the approach of Pumfrey J where expectations of

immediately rise,

success need not matter at all (what Lord Hoffmann
described as an ‘oxymoronic’ approach). As soon as
expectations of success are introduced, the obvious-to-
try hurdle must
since unlimited
things might be tried in technology research without
any expectation that they will work. But what of the
words ‘fair’ and even ‘real’ from Lundbeck? Is a fair/real
prospect of success a higher hurdle than a reasonable
one? Possibly, depending on the synonyms one looks to
for fair, such as ‘satisfactory’ or ‘considerable’.

In any case,

the move from the prevailing ‘low
hurdle’ approach to obviousness seen in decisions of
Pumfrey J and Laddie J seems certain. This is a good
point at which to look at the judgment of Lord Walker
in this case.

Lord Walker on Brugger
Lord Walker’s comments seem to reveal a speciﬁc
concern that technology is receiving insufﬁcient patent
protection.
In supporting Lord Hoffmann’s leading
judgment, Lord Walker particularly noted academic
observations made by Sir Hugh Laddie that refer to his
decision in Brugger, referred to earlier:

what makes something worth trying is the outcome of a
simple risk to reward calculation . . . the more commer-
cially attractive the solution . . . the harder it will be to
avoid an obviousness attack. In those circumstances a sol-
ution which is quite low down a list of alternatives, all of
which are more or less worth trying, will fail for obvious-
ness; a consequence which is consistent with the decision
in Brugger v Medic-Aid.

Lord Walker then notes Sir Hugh’s observation that the
rapid advance of
technology creates a serious and
growing problem for assessing obviousness, because
resources for researching potentially ground-breaking
technology are huge. Thus,
the most commercially
attractive research is more likely to be the most
obvious and less likely to be patentable—a bizarre
result. In stating this, he implicitly shares Sir Hugh’s
own criticism of the result in Brugger v Medic-Aid.

In these circumstances,

the Lords have sensibly
broadened the assessment to consider the likelihood of
technical success and the practical circumstances such
as the length of the list of available options (in the
endorsement of Kitchin J) and to distance somewhat
the availability of unlimited commercial resources.

Paul England . Obvious to try, one year on

anti-replicants. The Lords explained that the prior art
nonetheless left one in no better position than knowing
that
the solution may lie somewhere in the large
number of drugs which could be tried. It is difﬁcult to
imagine a ﬁrst instance court coming to such a view in
recent times.

Implications for formulation patents,
and beyond
The House of Lords has clariﬁed that the court must
look to the claim of a patent to identify the inventive
step. Provided the claim passes the ‘threshold test’ of
plausibility the information disclosed in the patent spe-
ciﬁcation is not relevant to questions of obviousness,
but only sufﬁciency. Will patentees now ﬁnd it easier
to obtain and defend patents on the basis of their
‘inventiveness’? The approach that something can only
be obvious to try in the fair expectation of its success
does appear to be a move away from the more hard
line approach adopted by Pumfrey J that expectation of
success is not relevant. Another move forward is the
Lords’ criticism of the Brugger approach that a poten-
tially vast number of hypothetical, alternative routes to
an invention may all be obvious to try if the resources
are available for them.

The facts of Angiotech also have important impli-
cations for patentees, and for formulation patents in
particular. Whilst Angiotech’s patent is not itself one of
the formulation kind, the parallels are clear: a known
item (a stent), for a known medical condition (resteno-
sis), combined with a component taken from a list of

for example,
known drugs (taxol). Substitute these,
with a known active ingredient, for a known disease,
combined with an excipient taken from a list of known
excipients. While such claims have been difﬁcult to
defend in the past, the analogy to Angiotech’s stent and
the need to show a fair (or perhaps, real) a priori
expectation that such a formulation will work suggests
this may be an easier proposition in future.

But the decision’s refusal to come to any hard and
fast test, in favour of a holistic approach, may mean it
is widely open to interpretation. How it settles into UK
patent law will only be seen as it is applied by the
lower courts in the coming months and years. But it is
submitted here that
the obviousness
hurdle has been raised by the Lords and so this is an
important authority, one that should make a difference
particularly in the ﬁeld of pharmaceutical patents.

the height of

If there were any doubt that the Lords intend this
decision to raise the hurdle on obviousness and
provide greater protection to patents of all kinds then,
to end, here are the words of Lord Neuberger in his
short, supporting judgment in Angiotech:

I have had the beneﬁt of reading in draft the opinions of
my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord
Walker of Gestingthorpe. I agree with them that
this
appeal should be allowed. Although the decision represents
a signiﬁcant development in United Kingdom patent law,
and we are differing from the views of highly experienced
Judges in that ﬁeld, . . . (emphasis added)
