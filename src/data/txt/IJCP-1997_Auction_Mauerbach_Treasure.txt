The Auction of the  "Mauerbach
Treasure"
Ignaz  Seidl-Hohenveldern*

Abstract: This  article  describes  the  history  of  the  objects  stored  at
the  Mauerbach  monastery  in  Austria  from  soon  after  the  Second
World War until their auction last year. During the war, the German
National  Socialists  had  collected  art  works  throughout  Europe  in
many  different  ways—through  theft,  confiscation,  forced  sales, and
legitimate sales. Both the legal issues raised by the attempts to deter-
mine  the  rightful  owners  of  these  objects  and  the  criticism  which
the  Austrian  government  received  for  failing  to  find  more  of  these
owners  are  discussed.  The  situation  was  finally  resolved  last  year
when  the remaining  objects  were  auctioned  and the proceeds  given
to various organizations representing the victims of the Nazis.

At  long  last,  the  story  of the  "Mauerbach  Treasure"  has  been  con-
cluded.  This hoard  of  art  objects  has been  the  source  of many  leg-
ends  owing  to  the  secrecy,  including  even  the  identification  of  the
objects  themselves, which  had  surrounded  it for  many years.1

1  The Origin  of the Mauerbach  Treasures

The origin  of the objects  which were stored  in Mauerbach  is tragic,
indeed.  Most  of  the  objects  were  seized  by  the  National  Socialists
from  Jewish owners, who perished  in the Holocaust.  Three-quarters
of  the  objects  came  from  the  U. S.  Army's  Central  Art  Collecting
Point  (CACP)  in  Munich.  At the  end  of  the  war,  a vast  amount  of
art treasures was stored in a salt mine in Alt-Aussee (Austria). These
objects  included paintings which were intended to form  the nucleus
of the Kunstmuseum  Linz  to  adorn  the  Braunes  Haus, the National
Socialist Headquarters  in Munich, and the SchloB in Posen  (Poznan,
Poland),2  which  was  meant  to  be  Hitler's  headquarters  in  Eastern
Europe.  As  Alt-Aussee  was  considered  to  be  an  excellent  shelter,
some public and private owners were also allowed to use this depot.
Austrian civilians had prevented the destruction of the depot ordered

by  the  Gauleiter  at  Linz3  pursuant  to  Hitler's  March  1945  "Nero
order"  not  to  let  any  valuable  objects  fall  into  enemy  hands. These
civilian  rescuers  had  found  a complete  list  of  the  objects  stored  in
Alt-Aussee. This list,4 as well as the listed objects, was handed over
to the U. S. Army. This list would have greatly facilitated  the return
of  the  objects,  but  unfortunately  it  was  lost  while  in  American
custody.

The U. S.  Army brought  the contents  of  this depot  to  the  CACP
in  Munich.  From  1945 to  1952, the  CACP  tried  to trace  the  legiti-
mate  owners  of  these  objects  and  succeeded  in  satisfying  the  most
obvious and best  documented  of the claims, particularly those  from
well-known  collections. At the time of the dissolution  of the CACP
in  1952, the remaining objects  were handed over to the U. S. Army
by Hofrat  Herrmann  Michel, the Director of the Vienna  Museum of
Natural  History  who  happened  to  be  in  Alt-Aussee  after  bringing
some  of  this  museum's  treasures  to the  salt  mine  for  safe-keeping.
His handing-over  of the  list  thus became, by  implication,  an  act of
his Ministry which was in charge of cultural property. Between  1952
and  1955, the role of the (Austrian) Federal Monuments Office  (Bun-
desdenkmalamt)  was  limited  to the  storage  of  these  remaining  ob-
jects.  The  U. S.  High  Commissioner  for  Austria  had  reserved  for
himself  the right  to dispose  of any  such objects.5  On 22 July  1955,
the art objects transferred  from  the CACP in  1952 "and all other art
objects  now in the custody of the Austrian Federal Government  and
still under the control  of the office  of the United  States  High  Com-
missioner  for  Austria  [were]  released  to  the  Austrian  Federal  Gov-
ernment  for  disposition."6

These objects which came from the CACP were not the only ones
to be finally  stored, from 1956 to  1994, in Mauerbach  near Vienna,
a former  Carthusian monastery. Added to this group were art objects
found  at  SchloG  Fischhorn  on  the GroGglockner  High  Alps road in
the  Land  Salzburg. This  Schlofi  had  been  transformed  into  an  SS
stronghold.  Moreover,  objects  deposited  in  Alt-Aussee  but  not
brought to the CACP, as well as objects from other depots in Vienna,
Linz  and  Salzburg, were  also  deposited  in  Mauerbach.  Finally,  art
objects  literally  left  stranded  in the streets at the end of the war and
objects  left  behind  in the living quarters and offices  of the  Occupy-
ing Powers in  1955 landed there, as well as objects from the rest of
the depots established by the Reichsstatthalter after  the first massive
and  indiscriminate  air raids  on Austrian  cities. Private persons who
were known  to own interesting  art objects  were pressured  into hav-
ing  them  taken  to  these  allegedly  safe  depots  in  Lower  Austria.
Three  of  the depots were blown up by the  SS pursuant  to the Nero
order; others were looted by the Soviet Army. Some of the remaining
objects  were  not  reclaimed  after  the  end  of  the  war,  their  owners
presumably  having perished, and ended up at Mauerbach.

All  objects  stored  in  Mauerbach  had  two  things  in  common  —
they  were  physically  present  in Austria  at  the  end  of  the  war,  and

their rightful owners have not been traced and may never be  found.
The present value of the hoard was estimated at DM 5 million.7 The
sum of the estimates in the auction catalogue8 is 33.836.675 Austrian
Schillings (ATS) for the lower estimates and ATS 49.760.820 for the
higher one (respectively  U. S.$4.7 to $7 million).

2  Title to the Mauerbach  Objects
2.1  Confiscated  Property
By  15  May  1946,9 Austria  had  adopted  the  UN  Declaration  of  5
January  1943  into  Austrian  Law,  providing  for  the  nullification  of
title  to  property  acquired  by  force  or  duress.  Thus  the  victims  of
National  Socialist confiscations  or their heirs, in principle, remained
the rightful  owners of the  objects  concerned.

2.2  Property  Purchased  under Duress
2.2.1  In Occupied Countries
While  Stalin  allegedly  intended  to  establish  a  museum  consisting
exclusively  of  looted  "trophies,"10  Hitler  conceived  the  Kunstmu-
seum at Linz as a comprehensive show of what he considered "desir-
able" art.11 This purpose could not have been fulfilled  if the Museum
had  been  limited  to  showing  merely  confiscated  Jewish  property.
Thus, paintings and other art objects were bought by German author-
ities  for  this  Museum, for  the "Braune  Haus" (Munich), and for  the
SchloB  in  Posen.  As far  as those  objects  found  in Alt-Aussee  were
acquired in territories occupied by Germany, the countries concerned
alleged  that  the  mere presence  of  the  German  Army  amounted  to
duress  entailing  the  nullification  of  these  purchases;  furthermore,
those  purchases  were  usually  made  with  subsequently  worthless
money  issued by the occupying power.

2.2.2  In  Germany
Owners  also alleged duress in the case of purchases by the Reich in
what  the  Reich  held to  be  its  own  territory.  A  case  in  point  is  the
Vermeer  painting  ("The  Artist  in  his  Studio")  formerly  owned  by
Count  Czernin  and sold  to  Hitler  at  a  price  which  was  considered
by some to be very low.12 In a suit by Czernin to recover the painting
from  the  Austrian  government,  the  Verwaltungsgerichtshof,13  as  in
previous  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court,  held  that  there  was  no
duress  involved  in that  case.  The  mere  fact  that  prior  to  the  war a
much higher price had been  offered  by a collector14  does not prove
the  existence  of duress.  Such  a price would  have been  paid only  if
an export permit could have been  obtained  for  the painting. Neither
the pre-1938  Austrian  authorities  nor the German  ones  would  have

been willing to grant such a permit. If no duress could be proved in
the  case  of  the  purchase  of  the  Vermeer  and  similar  cases,  these
objects,  at the end of the war, were German property  in Austria.

2.3  German Property  in Austria
Section  IV,  paragraph  3  of  the  Potsdam  Agreement  of  2  August
194515  allotted  German  property  in  Western  Austria  as  reparations
to  the  Western  Occupying  Powers  and  in  Eastern  Austria  to  the
USSR.  Under  Article  22  of the  State Treaty  of  15 May  1955,16 the
Allies transferred  these assets to Austria.17

Austria  based  its  claims  for  the  art  objects  which  had  not  been
returned  to  their  rightful  owners  by  the  CACP  on  the  ground  that
these  objects  had  been  found  in Austria  at the  end  of  the war  and,
as they  were then,  at  least  prima  facie,  German  property,  they  thus
had  equally  become  prima  facie  the  property  of  the  Republic  of
Austria.  We  doubt  whether  transferred  cultural  property  should  be
localized,  for the purpose of the  satisfaction  of reparation  claims, at
the place to which  it has been transferred  rather than  at its place of
origin.18  In  fact,  the  return  of  such  transferred  cultural  property  to
its home museum appears required by Article 56 of the Hague Rules
of Land  Warfare.19

The argument based on a prima facie property title is even weaker
in so far  as Germany  had  acquired title to the bulk of the  assets by
confiscation  rather  than  by  bona  fide  purchase.  Austria  based  its
claim  on an explicit transfer  by operation  of Article 22 of the  State
Treaty of  15 May  1955 and a letter of the U. S. Deputy High  Com-
missioner.  This  letter  of  22 July  1955 released  the  remnants  of  the
CACP objects to Austria "for disposition." However, both Article 22
of  the  State  Treaty  as  well  as  this  release  must  be  understood  in
connection  with  Article  26  of  the  State  Treaty, obliging  Austria,  in
so far as such action had not already been taken, to return any object
taken  on account  of  the racial  origin  or religion  of the  owner. Any
such property which remained heirless or unclaimed  for  six months
after  the coming into force  of the present Treaty was to be  transfer-
red  to  welfare  organizations  for  victims  of persecution  by  the Axis
Powers. Austria thus did not receive these objects for its free disposi-
tion  except  those which  had been  purchased  by German  authorities
or nationals  without  duress  {e. g.,  apparently  the Czernin Vermeer).
Austria remained bound like a trustee to trace the rightful  owners of
all other objects  received  from  the CACP.

3  Return by Austria
3.1  Prior to the  1969 Law
Austria's  obligation  to  return  apparently  heirless  property  became
increasingly difficult  to fulfill  with the passage of time. In the years
before  1969,  Austria  had  returned  more  than  10.000  art  objects  to

their rightful  owners,20 but these  included only a few  transferred  to
Austria  by  the  CACP  in  1952.  The  tracing  of  stolen  property  is
subject  to  the  law of diminishing  returns. It  is  this  fact  rather  than
pressure  by  the  four  Occupying  Powers21  which  explains  why,  in
the  early  years  of  the  occupation,  this  relatively  large  number  of
cases was brought under the general restitution laws,22 the only rele-
vant  legislation  at that time.

Of course, tracing the rightful  owners of apparently heirless prop-
erty  was  not restricted  to  art  objects.  Victims of the  Holocaust  had
been deprived of all their goods and thus also of their business enter-
prises  and  real  estate. It  would  have  been  intolerable,  if  those  who
robbed  the  victims  of  their  possessions  would  have  been  able  to
profit  from the fact that any heirs capable of filing a restitution claim
for  such  assets  had  also  been  murdered.  By  the  law  of  13  March
195723  on  Organizations  for  the  collection  of  heirless  property,
Austria  established two Collecting Agencies (Sammelstellen)  A and
B which were entitled to claim heirless property and to use the pro-
ceeds  for  welfare  for  the victims  of persecution.  The  Sammelstelle
A  was  entitled  to  bring  claims  for  heirless  property,  which  on  31
December  1937  had  belonged  to  persons  of  the  Jewish  faith.  The
Sammelstelle B was to collect property which belonged to any other
victims. The Sammelstellen were completely free  of all Government
influence  and were managed by individuals enjoying  the  confidence
of the victims.24

The Sammelstellen could claim only  in lieu of the rightful  owner
and  were  also  often  unable  to  establish  their  claims  by  identifying
an  heirless  object  as having  belonged  to  a  specific  person.  Not  all
objects  in Mauerbach could be identified  in this way  —  far  from  it.
What should be done with the rest? The very nature of the Holocaust
made reliance on any deadline for the foreclosure of claims problem-
atic. Direct heirs had been murdered together with the original own-
ers.  In  fleeing  from  Hitler,  potential  claimants  had  been  dispersed
all  over  the  world, some living  far from any center  of  communica-
tions.  They  might  never have  heard  of  the  CACP  —  and  even  less
likely  about  Mauerbach.  They  might  have  considered  it  a  hopeless
task  to try  to  trace what,  as of right,  belonged  to them. Only  when
they  learned  about  successful  claimants  would  they  change  their
mind,  and  as archives are gradually  opened,  new evidence  may be-
come  available.

3.2.  The  1969 Law
Nonetheless, any administration dislikes unfinished  business. A first
attempt  to  establish  a deadline  for  such  claims was made when, on
9 March  1967, the Austrian Federal Government introduced a bill for
that purpose. According to this Draft  Law,25 the objects remaining in
Mauerbach  after  that deadline would  go to the  Sammelstellen.  This
would  have  been  in conformity  with the  intentions  of Article 26 of

252

the  State  Treaty  of  1955,  as  well  as  with  assurances  given  by
Austrian officials  to the U. S. Army that Austria had no intention of
enriching itself by the objects  transferred  from  the CACP.26

However, the Sammelstellen  were eager to conclude27 and to dis-
tribute  the  assets  they  had  collected  to persons  in need,  80% to  go
to welfare  organizations close to the Jewish community, and 20% to
welfare  organizations  associated with other  victims. Thus, the  Sam-
melstellen  agreed  to  waive  any  further  claims  on  the  Mauerbach
objects, if Austria would be ready to pay in advance a lump sum for
those items remaining in Mauerbach after the expiration of the dead-
line for a final  filing of claims. This deadline, extended until the end
of  1972,  gave  claimants  more  than  two  years  to  file  their  claims.
Proceedings  for  the  restitution  of  claimed  objects  could  begin  only
after  that  deadline  had  passed.  Otherwise,  a  better  but  later  claim
could  not  have  been  satisfied.  As no  one  could  foretell  how  many
objects would remain unclaimed, guessing their value was a  difficult
task. The Sammelstellen  asked for ATS ten million (or DM  1,3 mil-
lion) and settled for ATS five million (or DM 700.000) plus 8 to  10
paintings  sold for U. S.$28,000.28  On the assumption that this lump
sum  would  have,  in  fact,  corresponded  to the  value  of  the  then re-
maining  objects,  Article  7 of  the  final  version  of  this  law,29  which
embodied  this  agreement  and  attributed  the  ownership  of  these  re-
maining assets to the Republic of Austria, would have been unobjec-
tionable from  a legal point of view. Under the same assumption, the
subsequent statement of the Government30 would have been correct,
that Austria, at no time, had tried to enrich itself out of the property
of the victims of National  Socialist  persecution.

However,  the  result  of  what  was  intended  to  be  the  last  appeal
for  claims  fell  drastically  below  all  expectations.  Only  72  items,
comprising  262 pieces,31  were  restored.  This  fact  caused  great dis-
satisfaction  among the victims of National  Socialist persecution and
led  to  doubts  whether,  under  these  changed  circumstances,  the
waiver  of  all  further  claims  by  Dr. Nahum  Goldmann  on  behalf  of
the  Committee  for  Jewish  Claims  on  Austria32  and  by  France,  the
United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  in  bilateral  exchanges  of
notes33  would  still be valid. Austria, nonetheless, began to act  as if
it  had  thus  become  the  rightful  owner  of  the  Mauerbach  treasure.
Plans were made for  distributing  the best pieces to several  Austrian
museums,  and  two  paintings  were  actually  loaned  to  Austrian  em-
bassies.34  However,  an  uneasiness  continued  to  exist.  The  objects
were returned to Mauerbach  or continued to remain there.

Even  if  the  sum  Austria  paid  to  the  Sammelstellen  had  been  of
equivalent  value  to  the  objects  remaining  in  Mauerbach  after  31
December  1972, it was  a serious psychological  mistake  for  Austria
to assert  its ownership over these objects.  It is true that the Nether-
lands after  World War II did attribute property, whose owners could
not be traced  within  a deadline, to several  Netherlands  State muse-
ums.35 However, in this matter, given their different  situations during
the war, Austria  is arguably not  in the  same position  as the  Nether-

lands  with  respect  to unclaimed  property,  although  understandable
psychological barriers have prevented Austrian politicians of the im-
mediate post-war  generation  from  admitting this  fact.36

3.3  The  1985 Law
Growing awareness in Austria, as well as criticism  from  abroad, led
to  the  adoption  of  the Second  Law  on Clarification  of  Title to Art-
istic  and  Cultural  Property  on  13  December  198537  which,  once
more,  set  a  new  deadline  for  filing  individual  claims  until  30  Sep-
tember  1986. The number of claims  made  pursuant  to this law was
slightly  larger than that made after  the First Law. The key provision
of  the  Second  Law,  however,  was  that  the  Republic  of  Austria,  as
the owner  of the  then remaining assets, would  auction them  off  for
the benefit  of the victims.

When  this  law  was  adopted,  the  debate  was  concerned  mainly
with how to restore the greatest possible number of objects to indivi-
dual  claimants.  Only  then  did  attention  turn  to  the  disposal  of  the
remaining  objects  by auction.  As a result,  the  Second  Law  needed
to be amended to provide for this auction.38 The Republic of Austria
transferred  the remaining objects, by a contract of 31 October  1995,
to the Federation of Jewish Communities of Austria. This Federation,
representing  the bulk of the victims, held  a benefit  auction of these
objects by Christie's Vienna, on 29 and 30 October  1996. The Feder-
ation  is  to  distribute  88% of  the proceeds  of the  auction  to  Jewish
victims  of the  Holocaust  and  12% of the proceeds,  in equal  shares,
to three welfare  organizations of other groups of victims, associated
with  respectively  the Austrian  Communist,  Social  Democratic,  and

The Auction  of  the "Mauerbach  Treasure"

Conservative  Parties.39  At  the  time  of  the  auction,  lawsuits  were
still pending concerning  eighteen  oil paintings. Insofar  as individual
claims  to  any  of  these  paintings  do  not  succeed,  they  will,  one  by
one,  be  handed  over  to  the  Federation  of  Jewish  Communities  for
auction on the same basis.

Any object bought  at these auctions may be freely  exported, even
if  under  other  circumstances  no  export  permit  would  have  been
granted.  An  example  of  this  is  Makart's  ceiling  decoration  for  the
library of the Palais Dumba, Vienna. Dumba had left  instructions in
his will that the library  should  stay  intact with all of Makart's work
remaining  in  situ.  However,  according  to  the  auction  catalogue,
Dumba's widow, Marie, donated the entire cycle, including the ceil-
ing  design,  to  the  City  of  Vienna.40  There  is  no  doubt  that  during
the war the ceiling  design  was purchased  for  Hitler's  Linz Museum
at  an  apparently  fair  price.  Yet,  according  to  the  Austrian  Federal
Ministry  of Finance, the  seller  was  not the Municipality  of Vienna,
but  one  of  the  Dumba  heirs.  Efforts  to  keep  this  design  in  Austria
failed.  At  the  Christie's  auction,  the  Kunsthistorische  Museum
stopped  bidding  for  this  ceiling  design  at  ATS  1,600,00  (DM
230,000).  The  design  was  sold  for  ATS  1,785,000  (DM  275,000),
allegedly to a Museum of the  19th Century in Taiwan. According to
the  Explanatory  Remarks  of  the  Austrian  Government  to  the  1985
Law,41 the grant of freedom  of exportation also eliminates any obsta-
cle  to  exportation  at  the  external  borders  of  any  other  European
Union  State  pursuant  to  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No.  391/92  on
the Export  of Cultural  Goods.42

Under Austrian  law, any purchase  at a public  auction bestows on
the  purchaser  an  original  title  to  property,  free  of  all  claims43  that
can  be  brought,  even  by  someone  who  might  have  recognized  the
property only after  seeing the pictures in the auction catalogue. Since
the enactment  of the Austrian  General  Civil Code of  1811, Austrian
law  grants  to  public  auctions,  like  the  one  held  by  Christie's,  this
privilege,  known  by  the  quaint  and  illustrative  name  of  "receiver's
privilege."44

Even after  the enactment  of the  1985 Law, Austria was the object
of political  pressure from  France and an unsuccessful  lawsuit by the
Netherlands45  asking  that  part  of  the  Mauerbach  paintings  be  re-
turned  to  them.  According  to  some  sources,  these  States  have  ad-
dressed  such  claims  to  the  Federation  of  Jewish  Communities  of
Austria,  after  Austria  transferred  to  this  Federation  the  property  of
the Mauerbach treasure. According to an "Information  regarding Le-
gal  Status"  in  the  Auction  catalogue,  the  Republic  of  Austria  has
guaranteed  to  this  Federation  an  exemption  from  liability  with  re-
spect  to  all  claims  by  third  parties  based  on  any  legal  deficiency
under the terms of the transfer  contract.  Whether  the titles  acquired
at the Christie's auction  and unencumbered  under Austrian  law will
be  recognized  as  such  in  these  countries  depends  on  the  operation
of conflict  of law rules and the concept prevailing in these countries
of ordre public.46

4  The Tracing  Process

Claimants  were  irritated by the  secrecy  surrounding  the  Mauerbach
treasure. The mere fact that the objects were stored in an old monas-
tery  had  given  rise  to  fears  that  such  storage  would  damage  the
paintings. At the  auction, the experts from  Christie's  stated that the
paintings  were  in  excellent  condition,  an  impression  shared  by  the
general  public  at their pre-auction presentation.  The main  source of
discontent,  however,  was the  method used  by  the Austrian  authori-
ties and courts to ascertain  whether a claim was justified.

The  Austrian  authorities  decided  to  handle  the  Mauerbach  prob-
lem  divorced  from  its  historical  and  political  context.  The  CACP
had  handed  over  to Austria  a receiver's  hoard,  to  be  handled  as  is
done  in  all  other  such  criminal  cases.  The  true  owners  had  to  be
found.  If tracing  efforts  fail,  any such criminal hoard is forfeited  to
the Republic of Austria. Should a rejected  claimant bring the matter
before the courts, the State's case would be presented by the Finanz-
prokuratur which protects all financial  interests of the State. Its staff
is  trained  to  obtain  the  maximum  financial  benefit  for  the  State,
leaving all other considerations to the political decision makers. The
self-righteous  feeling  of personal  innocence of Austrian  government
circles  in  the  immediate  post-war  period  did  not  completely  blur
their awareness of the moral and political implications of the Mauer-
bach problem. Dr. Machunze, the rapporteur on the  1969 Law in the
Nationalrat  (the  lower  house  of  the  Austrian  parliament),  speaking
for  the  majority,  stressed  that  all  these  claims  should  be  dealt  with
speedily  and  energetically  and  that  claimants  should  be  met  with
understanding  sympathy.47  Yet,  this  statement  appears  not  to  have
had  the  effect  of  taming  the  hunting  instincts  of  the  Finanzpro-
kuratur.

The agents of the Finanzprokuratur used the same tracing methods
as are employed  in ordinary cases of disposing of a receiver's hoard.
Due  notice  was  given  of  the  discovery  of  the  hoard  by  publishing
in the official  part of the newspaper  Wiener Zeitung a description of
the several  items, detailed enough so that the owner could recognize
the stolen item and make a claim, yet incomplete. A particular detail
was intentionally kept secret. A claimant would need to provide that
detail  and thereby prove  that he is indeed the owner.  Of course, the
use of this method is possible only if access to the objects  is strictly
forbidden.  The need for such secrecy is best illustrated by the results
of  the  showing  of  a  TV  film  which  gave  a  quick  glimpse  of  the
Mauerbach  treasures.  The  film  was  shown  abroad  in  1970  in  order
to  acquaint  possible  claimants  with  the  possibility  of  filing  claims
under  the  1969  Law. As a  result,  some  spurious  claims  were  made
for pictures where the camera had rested a bit longer.48 On the other
hand,  the  disadvantage  of  such  secrecy  is  demonstrated  by  press
reports according to which some owners were able to recognize their
property  only after  the illustrated auction catalogue was published a

month  before  the benefit  auction.  Most  of  these  owners  generously
agreed to donate these paintings to the auction.49

The  secrecy  method,  as  such,  appears  perfectly  logical.  As  a
matter of fact,  it seems to have been employed also by the CACP.50
However,  in  the  case  of  the  Mauerbach  treasure,  this  method  pre-
vented the restitution of the bulk of the hoard, contrary to the expec-
tation  in  1969.51  In  1969,  a  list  of  all  objects  held  in  storage  had
been  prepared  and published  in the  Wiener Zeitung for  the  purpose
of giving notice to potential claimants. In Austria, the publication of
a  notice  in  the  Wiener Zeitung  constitutes  proof  of  having  given
public notice. However, even in Austria this is a sheer fiction.  In the
Mauerbach case, the list of the treasures was also sent to all Austrian
embassies  which  were  required  to  render  this  information  public52
and inform  the leading newspapers in the country concerned that the
list could be consulted  at the Embassy.53

Rather  than  lack  of  publicity,  a  more  significant  reason  for  the
small  response  to  this  list  is the  sad  fact  that  many  of  the  original
owners  and  their  direct  heirs  had  perished  in  the  Holocaust.  The
claimant, possibly a distant relative, may have seen the painting only
briefly  during a visit. How could  such a claimant then find  the cor-
rect  answer  concerning  details  in  a  painting,  such  as  whether  the
animal,  other  than  cows,  in  a  painting  described  as  a  Dutch  land-
scape  with  animals, is  a dog or a horse?  Yet, ownership  could  best
be proved by the correct  answer to this "secret"  fact.

In his 1984 article, Decker recounted many of the causes of dissat-
isfaction  of  would-be  claimants  and  several  incidents  related  by

them.54  For example, one claimant  alleged  that  Austrian  authorities
had asked her to give further  details of the painting in order to  affix
those  details  on  an  inferior  copy,  thus  saving  the  original  for
Austria.55  This  suspicion  is  symptomatic  of the  atmosphere  of mis-
trust  on the part  of the  claimants  governing the proceedings.56  In a
relatively  large  number  of cases, there  were  several  claimants  for a
single painting.  The rival  claims  had to be cleared  up by the courts
before  the  painting  could  be  returned.  In  some  such  cases,  where
none  of the rival  claims appeared  fully  convincing,  the court attrib-
uted  to  each  of the claimants  a  share  in  the painting.  Such  a Solo-
monic  solution  may have  simplified  the task  of judges  and reduced
the number of claimants.57 Although this type of decision cannot be
reconciled  with strict  logic, the alternative would have been that the
painting, as none of the claims was fully convincing, would continue
to  belong  to  the  mass  of  heirless  property,  which,  under  the  1969
Law, would have ultimately become the property  of the Republic of
Austria.

Another complaint  aims at the secrecy of the proceedings  —  even
beyond  the  secrecy  required  to  facilitate  the  identification  of  the
claims.58  Because  in  Austria  the  right  to  privacy  is  held  in  much
higher  esteem  than the right to information,  the Austrian  authorities
refused  to  indicate  the  names  of  the  persons  to  whom  Mauerbach
objects  had  been  restored.  Perhaps  the  authorities  acted  on  the  as-
sumption  that these persons  would be interested  in keeping the  fact
of  restitution  a  secret  from  the  tax  authorities  in  their  country  of
residence.

Decker  also complained  that the Mauerbach  cases were heard by
several  judges,  who  changed  frequently  while  the  case  was  pend-
ing.59  Possibly  as a  reaction  to  Decker's  complaint,  all  Mauerbach
cases  under  the  1985 Law  were heard  by  a single judge,  Dr. Grad-
ischnik,  who,  on  that  account,  was  discharged  of  all  other  cases.
This  method  of  proceeding  caused  some  delay,  yet  it  insured  that
the Mauerbach cases were dealt with in a uniform manner by a judge
possessing expert knowledge. However, this judge too, could not lay
at  rest  the  main  complaint  of  the  claimants  —  he,  too,  could  not
decide  in equity. Rather, he had to require convincing proof of own-
ership, in spite of the above-mentioned difficulties  of proving owner-
ship after  more than fifty years. Let us take, as an example, a Dutch
claim  for  a Zumbusch  painting, described  by the claimant  as repre-
senting  a  small  girl  in  a white  dress,  standing  before  a  red  garden
table with a fruit  bowl on it. In Mauerbach, there was a Zumbusch60
showing  a  half  naked  putto  with  a  dark-brown  sash,  holding  a
fruitbowl.  It  is evident that  the description  of the claimant  does not
correctly  describe the Mauerbach  painting. Yet, assuming that  there
is  additional  evidence  that  the  claimant  really  owned  and  was  de-
prived of the painting representing the girl, it would  seem  equitable
to grant  him  the ownership  of the  Mauerbach  putto painting,  either
by attributing  the errors in his description  to the factors  enumerated

above,61 or outright on the basis of the equitable consideration  that,
otherwise,  if  the  putto  painting  were  unclaimed,  it  would  remain
heirless property. However, Judge Gradischnik  denied the claim  for
lack of identity between the painting of the girl and that of the putto.
Had  the  putto  painting  thus  remained  the  property  of  the  Republic
of Austria, I, too, would criticize such strictness. The situation looks
entirely  different,  however,  when  under  the  1985  Law, the  heirless
property  was to be  auctioned  for  the benefit  of victims  of National
Socialist  persecution.

5  Comments  on Pictures from an  Exhibition

Some  of the paintings  in  the pre-auction  exhibition  raise  intriguing
questions. Whatever could have caused a German to steal the portrait
of an almost unknown French general62 of the early  19th century by
an unknown  French artist  —  and why has it not been claimed by his
descendants,  as  his  name  appears  in  the  catalogue?  Possibly,  the
portrait  had  been  brought  to Austria  on  account  of  a marriage  well
before the war. The portrait then may have come to Mauerbach either
as  confiscated  Jewish  property  or  as  a  remnant  from  the  anti-air
raid  evacuations.  The  presence  of  the  Archipenko63  is  even  more
intriguing. No Reich authority would have bought this object, typical
of what Hitler considered to be "entartete Kunst" (degenerate art).64
Had it been  confiscated  by  such authorities  in France or elsewhere,
it would  have been  sold  in Switzerland  for  foreign  exchange, along
with  similar  objects  from  German  museums.  Even  if  it  had  been
owned  by  a  private  collector  in  1944, the  latter  very  likely  would
have hesitated to hand it over to the Reichsstatthalter for evacuation,

as  he  would  thus  have  admitted  to  appreciate  an  art  abhorred  by
Hitler, thus rendering himself politically  suspect.

Apart from  three or four outstanding  objects, the Mauerbach trea-
sure  is  no  treasure  at  all.  The  bulk  is  composed  of  19th  century
paintings by minor German and Austrian artists, such as, at the time,
could  be  found  in  the  drawing-room  of  any  cultivated  well-to-do
person.  Only  a very few of them  are below that standard  and could
be qualified  as outright Kitsch.

Thus, the Mauerbach exhibition  showed for the last time the inter-
ests and taste of members of Vienna's grand bourgeois society at the
turn  from  the  19th to the 20th  century.  The  glamour  of  this  period
cannot  be  separated  from  the  contribution  thereto  by  Austrians  of
Jewish  descent.  Therefore,  in my mind, the most poignant paintings
in the exhibition  are those of unknown  elderly gentlemen, the origi-
nal owners of most of the other paintings. These portraits, presuma-
bly of doctors,  lawyers or minor industrialists, evoke the same  feel-
ings  as  do  late  18th century  pastels  of  lovely  French  countesses  —
the pathetic awareness that the subjects portrayed in the former were
to  perish  in  the  Holocaust  and  in  the  latter  at  the  guillotine.  There
lies  some  consolation  in  the  thought  that  these  gentlemen  would
certainly  have  approved  of  the  idea  that,  if  the  paintings  could  not
be handed over to their lawful  heirs, the proceeds of their sale should
go to charity  for  their fellow-victims  of National  Socialist crimes.

6  The  Auction

The  auction  of  the  Mauerbach  treasures  was  held  in  Vienna  on
29—30  October  1996 by  Christie's,  which  generously  waived  any
remuneration  for  its services. Before  the auction, the proceeds were
expected  to  reach  ATS 35  million  =  DM  5 million.65  Under  strict
rules of accounting, the Republic of Austria might have been able to
claim  the  return  of the ATS 5 million  (=  DM 700.000)  it had paid
in  1969  to  the  Sammelstellen  as  a  lump  sum  for  the  Mauerbach
treasure,66 possibly even with interest. However, in view of the pur-
pose  of the present auction no such claims were  even  raised.67

It  is  due  to  the  sentimental  factor  involved,  as  well  as  to  the
knowledge  that  the  proceeds  go  to  welfare  institutions  for  victims
of National  Socialism, that the result  of the Mauerbach  auction was
very  different  indeed. Thus, the proceeds  of  the  auction  amount  to
more  than  ATS  155,1 million  =  DM  22,5  million,  all  lots  having
been  sold.68  By comparison, the main Autumn auction at the Doro-
theum,  the  main  Vienna  auction  house,  offering  objects  of  similar
or superior  quality ended in disappointment,  with the highest  bid of
ATS 2,53  million  (DM 360.000) and most of the better  lots remain-
ing  unsold.69

So  this  unique  evidence  of Jewish  cultural  life  at  the  end  of  the
19th century has been dispersed all over the world, just as were their

former  owners.  In  a  way,  it  is  regrettable  that  a  proposal  made  a
long time ago by Martin Weyl, the Director of the Israel Museum in
Jerusalem,70  was  not  accepted.  He  would  have  liked  to  exhibit  the
entire  treasure,  "if  the  quality  of  the  paintings  [was]  good."  From
the point of view of cultural  history, such an offer  would  have been
more than welcome. From the strictly artistic point of view, this  offer
would be less tempting. Of course, some of the objects at Mauerbach
would do honour to any museum, but how could one justify  to show,
at the same time, well over twenty landscapes with cows and another
dozen  with  sailboats  in heavy  seas?  So it seems the better  solution,
after  all, that this treasure, whose origin is fraught  with robbery and
murder,  has  been  sold  for  the  benefit  of  the  victims  thereof.  It  is
regrettable that it took so long to arrive at this solution, although the
present article tries to explain the reasons for some of the  difficulties
involved.

13  Contrary to what Decker, id. at 63,  seems to believe, this Court enjoys  power

and  prestige  similar to that of the  Supreme  Court.

14  According to Decker, id. at 63, Jeromir Czernin-Morzin claimed that Andrew
Mellon  had offered  to buy the painting for as much as $6 million  before the
war.  Hitler  bought  the Vermeer  in  1940 for  1.65 million  reichsmarks
($660,000).  A similar  plea  of duress  had been  raised  before  the Austrian-
German  Arbitral  Tribunal  in the case  of Stiftung  PreuBischer  Kulturbesitz,
Berlin-Dahlem  v. Mercedes de Leloir nee Princess Dietrichstein.  In its Bind-
ing  Opinion  No. 84 of 23  January  1960,  the Arbitral  Tribunal  decided to
leave  this  aspect  of the  case  to the civil  courts. See  IGNAZ  SEIDL-HOHEN-
VELDERN,  THE AUSTRIAN-GERMAN  ARBITRAL  TRIBUNAL  ESTABLISHED BY

Decker, A Legacy  of Shame,  supra  note 2, at 64, also  cites  Dr. Hermann
Fillitz, director of the Kunsthistorisches  Museum in Vienna, that the Czernin
claim  was adjudicated  by an American  court  with  the same  result.  It is
difficult  to understand  how a United  States court  could  have exercised juris-
diction  over  this  claim.  Perhaps  this  allegation  is  based  on the strange
decision  in Bernstein  v. Van  Heyghen  Freres,  163 F.2d 246 (2d Cir. 1947),
I. L. R. 14, 11, in which the US Circuit Court in  1947 (!) held  that it did not
have  jurisdiction  to determine  the plaintiff's  claim  that  he had  transferred
his property  under duress; the court  thus refused  to inquire  into the validity,
under  German  law, of acts  of officials  of that  State,  exercising,  in  1937,
duress  against a victim  of racial  persecution. See EDWARD  D. RE,  FOREIGN

18  While we have no doubt concerning the validity of Austria's title, for exam-
ple,  to the Linz Steel Works, built by the Reich during the war, we hesitate to
apply this reasoning to evacuated  cultural property. The presence of valuable
manuscripts  of the Berlin  museums  in a Schlofl  in Silesia  was just  as fortu-
itous  as that  of the CACP  objects  in Alt-Aussee.

influenced  by  this  argument.  WILFRIED  FIEDLER,  INTERNATIONALER  KUL-

50  Gasselseder's  report to the Federal  Monuments  Office  of 29 July  1949, Ar-
chives  of  the  Federal  Monuments  Office,  Restitution  Matters,  reads  very
much like the complaints of refugee  claimants recorded by Decker, A  Legacy
of  Shame,  supra  note 2, at 68 — 71.  In fact,  I wonder  how the German and
French  authorities  were  able  to  identify  the  rightful  owners  of a  hoard  of
French  paintings  found  in a  deceased  former  German  officer's  suitcase in
Halle. The paintings were identified  after  they were exhibited,  first  in Berlin
and  later  in Paris,  for the purpose  of locating  the rightful  owners  of these
paintings,  which  were presumably  stolen or bought  illegally  during the war.
Yet,  some  such  owners  were  found  in the end. Seidl-Hohenveldern, Kun-
straub  im Krieg, supra note 45,  at 58;  FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE  ZEITUNG,

tus  for the making and circulating  of these  lists,  also  among  international
Jewish  refugee  organizations.

54  That  world-wide  attention  was drawn  to the Mauerbach  treasure  may  cer-
tainly  be attributed  to the highly  engaging  and well-written  article  by  An-
drew  Decker.  This merit  is two-fold.  It prompted  Austria  into  renewed ac-
tion, and it acquainted  more victims and their heirs with the existence of the
Mauerbach  hoard and thus of a possible chance to recover some of the goods
robbed  from  their next-of-kin,  which  — apart from the often  relatively  small
financial  value  of the  objects  — were  of the  highest  sentimental  value  to
them.  Decker  also described  and passionately  attacked  Austrian  authorities
for  the  many  obstacles  encountered  by would-be  claimants.  His article  is
based  largely on the recitals  of such  claimants.

Zeitung,  described  there  as "Young  lady  with  a lace  scarf  and  a flower in
her  low neckline  <57cm  x  57cm>").  Mrs. Fent  suspected  the Austrian
government  had repainted  a different  von Amerling  to fit her description.
According to the auction  catalogue,  MAUERBACH  AUCTION  CATALOGUE, su-
pra  note 8, at 230—31, No. 517, von Amerling had painted two versions of
the  much  larger  (94,5 cm x 79 cm)  painting  listed  as No.  15 in the Wiener
Zeitung ("Lady in Turkish costume, reading"). Rather than accept Mrs. Fent's
theory, it appears much  more likely  that von Amerling had also painted two
versions  of No.  16 or that, at some  later  time, a copy  had been  made of it,
so as to leave to several members of a family a copy of what may have been
the portrait of one of its  members. Seidl-Hohenveldern, Kunstraub  im Krieg,
supra  note  45, at 61. Or, possibly, in Mrs. Fent's  recollections, the painting
had become  more  beautiful  than it actually  was.

56  Decker, A Legacy  of Shame, supra  note 2, at 73—74, also mentions the case
of  Mr.  Leitmann,  whose  claim  rivaled  that  of a Dutchman,  who allegedly
had  made  more  than  one spurious  claim.  After  the judge  had attributed to
each of them a half share in the painting, Mr. Leitmann  discovered  evidence
that  was clearly  incompatible  with  the document  on which  the Dutchman
had  relied.  The Austrian  Consul-General  in San  Francisco  dissuaded Mr.
Leitmann from  an appeal against this decision. The Consul-General  reasoned
that  a bird  in the hand  is worth  two in the bush.  This  may have  been a
realistic appreciation of how the Austrian  legal  system may sometimes work
—  but is this blackmail, as Mr. Leitmann  alleges? A blackmailer acts for his
advantage, but here, in case of a successful  appeal,  the painting  would not
have  become  the property  of Austria.  This  would  only  have  been  the case,
if,  on appeal,  the judges,  while  denying  the claim  of the Dutchman, had
attributed  more  weight  to the flaws  existing  also  in Mr. Leitmann's  claim
than the lower court had done.

59  Decker,  A Legacy  of Shame,  supra  note  2, at 73. Mrs. Duke,  quoted by
Decker, id. at 71, complained specifically  about the bizarre behavior of Judge
Kremtzov.  This judge  is an excellent  jurist,  but his bizarre  behaviour was
demonstrated  in other  cases as well.  Judge  Kremtzov  resigned  rather  than
agree to an examination  of his  mental  stability.  He joined  a law firm, mur-
dered his senior partner  and is actually  serving a life  sentence.
