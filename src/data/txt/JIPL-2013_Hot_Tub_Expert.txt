Hot-tubbing experts: is there scope for the use
of concurrent expert evidence?
David Wilson, Christopher Sharp, Sue Gilchrist, and
Nina Fitzgerald*

In the end, concurrent evidence is generally likely to produce
more ounces of merit which will be worth more to a judge than
pounds of charisma or demeanour.1

Overview
In April 2013, new Civil Procedure Rules were intro-
duced in England and Wales in light of the ﬁndings of
Lord Justice Jackson’s review of the costs of civil litiga-
tion. One of those proposed reforms, which has now
been embodied in the new Civil Procedure Rules, relates
to the use of concurrent expert evidence, more often
known as ‘hot-tubbing’. This article reviews the general
position of experts in English litigation, reports on the
pilot study of the use of concurrent expert evidence
carried out in Manchester over the last two years which
led to Lord Justice Jackson’s recommendation, reviews
the use of concurrent evidence procedures in Australia
in intellectual property litigation and looks to the future
use of the process in England under the recently intro-
duced rules.

Key but costly
Expert witnesses have long been a key aspect of intellec-
tual property litigation in England and other common
law jurisdictions elsewhere around the world (e.g the
United States, Australia and Canada). In English patent
litigation, which almost always involves issues of a tech-
nical nature and/or determining the state of the art at a
speciﬁc point in time, the expert witnesses’ opinions are
critical to educating the court and assisting the judge to
determine issues of invalidity (e.g inventive step and in-
sufﬁciency) and infringement. Hence, in English patent
litigation, it is often said that an expert’s evidence, in-
cluding his or her performance in the witness box, can
determine the outcome of a case.

Given the importance of expert evidence, the prepar-
ation of written reports and testimony at trial can be

costs of civil litigation in England have continued. In

Appeal tasked with reviewing civil litigation, delivered

his ﬁnal report on the costs of such proceedings, which
included 109 recommendations for promoting access to
justice at proportionate cost.2

Two such recommendations were made by Lord
Justice Jackson relating to expert evidence. The ﬁrst was
that any party seeking to adduce expert evidence should
provide an estimate of the cost of such evidence. The
second recommendation was that the procedure of con-
current evidence developed in Australia should be
piloted and, if the results of the pilot were positive, the
Civil Procedure Rules should be amended to allow for
concurrent evidence in appropriate cases. Concurrent
evidence is more informally known as ‘hot-tubbing’ and
involves the parties’ witnesses being sworn in together
and providing oral testimony at the same time. As men-
tioned, it is not a new procedure, having been utilized in
international arbitrations and Australian litigation for
many years, and more recently in Competition Appeal
Tribunal proceedings in the UK (eg in Genzyme v Ofﬁce
of Fair Trading3).

This article will focus on this second recommendation
by Lord Justice Jackson and explore the use of concur-
rent evidence in Australia (and elsewhere) and the possi-
bilities for its introduction into English intellectual
property litigation. However, ﬁrst, it is necessary to con-
sider the current position of expert witnesses in English
litigation as well as Lord Justice Jackson’s proposals in
more detail.

Current position in England
In 1999 the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) were intro-
duced to try and reduce the cost of civil litigation in
England. These included new provisions directed to con-
trolling expert evidence. In his Access to Justice Report,
Lord Woolf was, in particular, very concerned about the
risk of partisanship of expert evidence:

Expert witnesses used to be genuinely independent experts.
Men of outstanding eminence in their ﬁeld. Today they are
in practice hired guns. There is a new breed of litigation
hangers-on, whose main expertise is to craft reports which
will conceal anything that might be to the disadvantage of
their clients.

The new provisions implementing Lord Woolf ’s recom-
mendations now form Part 35 of the CPR, and the key
points are as follows:
† CPR 35.1: expert evidence is restricted to that which

is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings.

† CPR 35.3: the duty of the expert is to help the court
on matters within his or her expertise. That duty over-
rides any obligation to the person from whom an
expert has received instructions, or payment.
† CPR 35.4: no party may call an expert or put in evi-
dence an expert’s report without the court’s permis-
sion. If permission is granted, it shall only be in
relation to the expert named by the party or in rela-
tion to the ﬁeld of expertise identiﬁed.

The second of those provisions is supplemented by a
corresponding Practice Direction which states
that
expert evidence should be the independent product of
the expert uninﬂuenced by the pressures of litigation,
and that experts should assist the court by providing ob-
jective, unbiased opinions on matters within their ex-
pertise and should not assume the role of an advocate.4

It is also necessary to highlight one further provision
relating to the conduct of evidence from witnesses at
trials in England. A witness’s written evidence stands as
evidence in chief. Therefore, at trial, unless there are
additional issues that go beyond those which have been
advanced in the written evidence (in England expert evi-
dence is usually exchanged 12 to 8 weeks before trial),
there will be no examination in chief and a witness will
only be cross-examined and possibly re-examined.

The role of an expert witness speciﬁcally in intellectual
property cases has been considered in a number of deci-
sions by the English courts. Most recently,
in Med-
immune Limited v Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited,5
a patent infringement and revocation case, Mr Justice
Arnold reiterated that the duty of an expert witness is to
assist the court on matters within his expertise, and
addressed issues in relation to the instruction of expert
witnesses by the legal representatives in patent litigation:

A cardinal aspect of properly instructing the expert is to
ensure that the expert is put in a position to express an inde-
pendent and impartial opinion.

He also considered that expert witnesses in patent litiga-
tion were in an unusual position in that they were often
leading scientists who had no prior experience of patent
actions or legal issues such as the identity and attributes
of the skilled person, the common general knowledge
and whether or not something is obvious. The judge
noted that, because of those constraints, the legal repre-
sentatives often drafted the expert report on behalf of
the expert, on the basis of what the expert had told
them: such an approach could entail a risk of loss of ob-
jectivity on the part of the expert and partisan evidence

that during cross-examination could be exposed. This
case is a reminder of the importance of independent and
objective expert evidence to judges in patent cases,
which must be safeguarded right from their initial
contact with the lawyers (both in-house and external
counsel). This echoes the now-famous words of the late
Mr Justice Laddie in Cala Homes v Alfred McAlpine6
where, ﬁnding that an expert witness was exhibiting
‘pragmatic ﬂexibility’ with his opinions, he said:

The judge is not a rustic who has chosen to play a game of
Three Card Trick. He is not fair game. Nor is the truth.

English judges have also considered the role of expert
evidence in non-patent cases, and in recent years, there
has been some judicial comment about the utility of
expert evidence in design, trade mark and passing-off
cases. For instance, in Procter & Gamble Co v Reckitt
Benckiser (UK) Ltd,7 Lord Justice Jacob addressed the
relevance of expert evidence in relation to registered
designs. In that case the Judge said that the scope for
evidence in relation to a registered design is very limited:

The evidence of experts, particularly about consumer pro-
ducts, is unlikely to be of much assistance: anyone can point
out similarities and differences, though an educated eye can
sometimes help a bit. Sometimes there may be a piece of
technical evidence which is relevant—e.g.
that design
freedom is limited by certain constraints. But even so, that is
usually more or less self-evident and certainly unlikely to be
controversial to the point of a need for cross-examination,
still less substantial cross-examination.

Lord Justice Jacob made similar observations in Dyson
Limited v Vax Limited,8 a case concerning infringement
of a UK registered design, but went further, stating that
it was highly desirable in registered or unregistered
design cases that, if permission for expert evidence was
to be given at all, ‘the precise ambit of that evidence
should be deﬁned’ and the expert should be told what
question or questions are to be addressed and conﬁne
themself to those. That exercise should take place at the
case management conference.

The position is similar in relation to trade marks
where, in Hasbro Inc v Nahrmittel GmbH,9 Mr Justice
Floyd stated that issues relating to what a customer will
think when he or she sees a particular word or sign, are
all points on which a judge is able to form his or her
view, and expert evidence is not of assistance. At the
costs stage of that same case, Mr Justice Floyd stated:

[1995] FSR 818.
[2008] FSR 8.
[2012] FSR 4.

I would not wish to do anything to encourage the use of
expert witnesses in proceedings of this nature. I do not
think it was justiﬁed to call an expert and produce lengthy
reports, both in chief and reply, to deal with issues which ul-
timately fell for my decision in this case.

He decided to disallow the recovery of costs by the suc-
cessful party in relation to their expert evidence.

Thus in recent years the judiciary has had cause to
reﬂect on the utility of expert evidence in intellectual
property cases. More generally, concerns have been
raised by both the judiciary and practitioners regarding
the cost of expert evidence in civil litigation and the po-
tential inefﬁciencies of such evidence, given the adversar-
ial nature of the legal system.

The Jackson Reforms
In light of those continuing concerns,
in November
2008, the then Master of the Rolls, Sir Anthony Clarke,
appointed Lord Justice Jackson to carry out a detailed
review of costs in civil litigation in England and to make
recommendations to promote access to justice at pro-
portionate cost. Lord Justice Jackson carried out exten-
sive research into the costs of civil
litigation and
delivered his Preliminary Report in May 2009.10 In
Chapter 42 of
the judge
addressed expert evidence, noting that there were con-
cerns about the cost of experts and the fact that expert
evidence often went beyond the issues in the case and
included irrelevant content. Lord Justice Jackson then
made some suggestions for saving cost, including se-
quential exchange of expert evidence (as opposed to
simultaneous exchange) in order to prevent the issue of
‘the ships passing in the night’, a presumption that all
experts on issues of quantum are instructed on a single
joint basis, and consideration of the use of concurrent
expert evidence at trial.

the Preliminary Report,

In relation to concurrent evidence, in his Preliminary
Report, Lord Justice Jackson suggested that, if practi-
tioners and the court saw any merit in the procedure,
then there should be a pilot exercise. In addition, the
Judge reviewed in detail Chapter 58 of the civil proce-
dures in Australian litigation, including the use of con-
current evidence. He stated that judges from the New
South Wales bench of the Federal Court of Australia
considered that the procedure was effective, saving time
and costs and leading to expert witnesses undertaking
their proper role of assisting the court. The judges also

that concurrent evidence disposed of

the
thought
problem of testimony becoming a one-on-one gladiator-
ial combat between witness and cross-examiner.

After publication of the Preliminary Report, there was
then a period of consultation with practitioners and the
judiciary in England on the various suggestions made by
Lord Justice Jackson. This led to a Final Report which
was delivered in December 2009.11

In Chapter 38, Lord Justice Jackson reported on the
submissions he had received during the consultation
period. The Law Society for England & Wales and the
Bar Council agreed that the cost of experts was a signiﬁ-
cant part of civil litigation. However, many practitioners
stated that expert evidence, if it was going to be of value
to the court, was bound to be expensive. In relation to
concurrent evidence, the judge reported that the views
from stakeholders fell into three broad camps: (a) out-
right opposition, (b) general support and (c) cautious
support subject to a pilot.

The judge made over 100 recommendations in his
Final Report in order to improve access to justice. Two
of those recommendations related to expert evidence:

† The CPR should be amended in order to require that
a party seeking permission to adduce expert evidence
must furnish the court with an estimate of the costs of
that evidence.
† The procedure developed in Australia known as con-
current evidence should be piloted, and it the results
of the pilot are positive, then consideration should be
given to amending the CPR to provide for use of that
procedure in appropriate cases.

Following Lord Justice Jackson’s Final Report, a pilot
study in relation to concurrent evidence was initiated at
the Manchester Technology and Construction Court and
Mercantile Court, a regional seat of the High Court.
Before considering the procedure used in the Man-
chester pilot study and the results in more detail, it is
useful to look at the practice of concurrent evidence in
Australia over the past decade or so.

Australian perspective
A brief history of the use of concurrent
evidence in Australia
Australian judges have been known to claim proudly
that they were the ﬁrst to develop concurrent evidence.
A brief look into the history of hot-tubbing reveals that
the procedure was experimented with as early as the late
1970s and 1980s. However, it was not until the mid-
1990s and 2000s that it became a popular, and in some
cases mandatory, method of receiving expert evidence.

While there is some debate, the ﬁrst use of concurrent
evidence appears to have been in the Trade Practices Tri-
bunal (now the Australian Competition Tribunal). In
Re Queensland Co-Op Milling Association Limited and
Deﬁance Holdings Limited.12 Justice Woodward, presi-
dent of the Tribunal, was inﬂuenced by contemporary
criticism in the Commonwealth Arbitration Commis-
sion of the procedures used in receiving economists’
expert evidence.13 He therefore devised a less adversarial
approach directing the three economist experts to
submit their preliminary evidence in writing and then,
after hearing the case’s oral, non-opinion evidence, to
submit written statements of their ﬁnal views, taking
into account the evidence presented. Once the reports
were ﬁnalized, the experts engaged in oral debate with
one another in court followed by some discussion with
counsel in court.14 Despite this early experiment, the Tri-
bunal did not use the approach again until the mid-
1990s, under Justice Lockhart’s presidency.15

Concurrent evidence was also experimented with in
the 1985 case of Spika Trading Pty Ltd v Royal Insurance
Australia Ltd,16 where evidence was given concurrently
by ﬁve hydrologists regarding ﬂood damage. There was
not enough room in the witness box for all ﬁve experts,
so all of the experts gave evidence from where they sat in
the body of the court.17

During the 1990s, a number of tribunals began to
use concurrent evidence intermittently, including the
Trade Practices Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal18 and the New South Wales Land and Envir-
onment Court (LEC) under Chief Judge McClellan

Counsel for both parties requested that the evidence given orally be done
with the witnesses presented to the Tribunal in panels. This allowed a
great deal of fruitful interaction between the parties and particularly the
scientiﬁcally expert members of the Tribunal. It assisted the Tribunal
greatly to come to grips with complex material and shortened the time of
hearing. The parties and counsel are to be congratulated for this and
their whole approach in assisting the Tribunal in its task.

(as he then was).19 This was achieved without the
promulgation of any institutional rules of procedure
explicitly permitting the reception of concurrent evi-
dence. For example, the LEC explicitly acknowledged
that hot-tubs were not following an explicit rule or
Practice Note.20 However, the LEC concluded there was
no need for such a rule, as the procedure was working
very well.21 The ﬂexibility on procedure which was
already afforded to the Trade Practices Tribunal, the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the LEC meant
that
the procedure could be implemented without
breaching their mandate.22

In 1998, the Federal Court of Australia was the ﬁrst
court to institutionalize the practice of concurrent evi-
dence in its rules.23 It was suggested this was perhaps
partly due to the inﬂuence of Justice Lockhart (previous-
ly the president of the Trade Practices Tribunal), by then
a Federal Court Judge.24 These rules permitted, but did
not require, the court to use hot tubs when receiving
expert evidence. The ACT then followed the Federal
Court, adopting new Supreme Court rules modelled
upon the Federal Court’s innovation.25

Following the success of concurrent evidence in the
Federal Court, the Australian Law Reform Commission
(ALRC) in its 2000 Report, ‘Managing Justice: A Review
of the Federal Civil Justice System’, recommended that
procedures to adduce expert evidence in a panel format
should be encouraged whenever appropriate.26 The
ALRC claimed that it was desirable for courts and tribu-
nals to have rules or practice directions expressly
empowering, and therefore encouraging,
judges and
tribunal members to direct that expert evidence be
adduced in a panel format.27

In 2005, the New South Wales legislature introduced
the Civil Procedure Act 2005, under which the Uniform
Civil Procedure Rules 2005 were introduced. A feature of
the new rules was regulation 31.35 which permitted the
reception of concurrent expert evidence.

The procedure itself—how does it work?
While concurrent evidence now has a long history in
Australia, the procedure by which it is carried out is sig-
niﬁcantly less established, and judges have expressed the
desire for ﬂexibility depending upon the circumstances

of each case. Each court and tribunal that allows concur-
rent evidence has different rules and procedures. Since
the vast majority of intellectual property cases in Austra-
lia are heard by the Federal Court of Australia, this
article focuses on the implementation of concurrent evi-
dence by the Federal Court.

Where the parties ﬁle evidence from two or more
experts about a similar question, the Federal Court may
make an order for the evidence of those experts to be
given concurrently.28 The nature and scope of that order
can vary signiﬁcantly on a case by case and a judge by
judge basis. Rule 23.15 of the Federal Court Rules 2011
allows for judges to require one or more of the following
steps to be taken:

(a) that the experts confer, either before or after writing

their expert reports;

(b) that the experts produce to the court a document
identifying where the expert opinions agree or
differ;

(c) that the expert’s evidence in chief be limited to the

contents of the expert’s expert report;

(d) that all factual evidence relevant to any expert’s opi-
nions be adduced before the expert is called to give
evidence;

(e) that on the completion of the factual evidence men-
tioned in para (d), each expert swear an afﬁdavit
stating:

(i) whether the expert adheres to the previously

expressed opinion; or

(ii) if the expert holds a different opinion;

(A) the opinion; and

(B) the factual evidence on which the opinion

is based;

(f) that the experts give evidence one after another;

(g) that each expert be sworn at the same time and that
the cross –examination and re-examination be con-
ducted by putting to each expert in turn each
question relevant to one subject or issue at a time,
until the cross –examination or re–examination is
completed;

(h) that each expert gives an opinion about the other

expert’s opinion;

(i) that

the experts be cross–examined and re –

examined in any particular manner or sequence.29

The taking of any or all of these steps is at the discretion
of the judge. In fact, Rule 23.15 adds: ‘The Court may
dispense with compliance with the Rules and may make
orders inconsistent with the Rules—see rules 1.34 and
1.35.’ Accordingly, each judge of the Federal Court has
developed, and is continuing to develop, their own pro-
cedure for concurrent evidence, and some judges have
elected not to allow it at all.

While the differences between the judges make it difﬁ-
cult to generalize, in intellectual property cases one ap-
proach recently applied in major cases involved the
following process:

1. Agreed Questions. The parties’

lawyers prepare an
agreed list of questions for the experts (settling the
questions may require the judge’s intervention).

2. The ‘Conclave’. Experts on the same subject matter

meet (without lawyers present).

3. Experts, Agreed Report. The experts prepare a joint

report in response to the questions.

4. The ‘Hot Tub’. At the time of giving oral evidence,
each expert will be sworn in at the same time and all
of the experts will sit in the witness box together. Each
witness will state their opinion on the ﬁrst of the
questions. Following this, there may be some discus-
sion between the experts in relation to the question.
At this time, the judge may also put questions directly
to the experts to seek to assist the judge’s understand-
ing of the evidence. The experts may also question
each other.

5. Cross-examination. Once each of the topics has been
addressed, traditional cross-examination may take place.

The procedure has largely been considered a success
by the judges who have utilized it, and by the profession.
Inconsistencies in the procedure in individual cases have
been a cause for concern for the profession. There are a
number of consequences of this inconsistency:

1. It is difﬁcult to inform experts or potential experts of
the time commitment that will be required as a result
of the requirement for expert meetings, joint reports
and extended time in the witness box. Experts often
have a full-time high-level occupation which can con-
ﬂict with the many additional hours they may be

required to spend when, in addition to afﬁdavit evi-
dence, they may be required to give evidence concur-
rently (and participate in each of the steps above). It
is important that solicitors brieﬁng expert witnesses
inform the expert of the potential for concurrent evi-
dence and give fair warning about the time commit-
ment required by the expert in those circumstances. It
is sometimes the case that an expert may not be able
or willing to assist when they are fully informed of the
time commitment. This may limit the pool of experts
available to assist the court in intellectual property
litigation.

2. The role of an expert, if the conclave, joint report and
hot tub (and cross-examination) phases are all in-
volved in a case, can be a much more demanding role
for the expert. Some experts may be more (or less)
comfortable in these contexts than in the more tightly
constrained context of cross-examination only. Cur-
rently, practitioners do not know whether or not the
experts retained will be required to engage in each of
these contexts. Judges may need to be mindful that
the level of an expert’s expertise in a particular tech-
nical area should be the focus, not the ability of the
expert to navigate each of these different contexts.

3. There is potential for the free-ﬂowing nature of a dis-
cussion in the hot-tub to result in signiﬁcant evidence
in chief in addition to the afﬁdavit evidence (which
evidence is often prepared over many months and has
been provided to the other parties months before the
hearing). This causes difﬁculties for counsel for the
parties who are required either to make a quick objec-
tion or address the new evidence. It may also cause
problems for the other experts and the judge who, in
the absence of an objection, could be required to deal
with new and potentially irrelevant issues. This can
also be unsettling for the experts who may be cut off
by an objection mid-sentence for reasons which are
obscure to them.

4. Finally, the absence of a set procedure makes it difﬁ-
cult to advise clients as to the procedure that will be
applied in their case, and to provide a cost estimate at
the outset of the proceedings. While knowledge of
which judge will hear the matter can assist in advising
on the likelihood and extent of concurrent evidence,
this alone is not sufﬁcient as the procedure may still
vary depending on the particular circumstances, and
cases can be transferred to a different judge before the
trial.

David Wilson et al. . Hot-tubbing experts: is there scope for the use of concurrent expert evidence?

ARTICLE

697

Despite the inconsistencies in the procedure in indi-
vidual cases, concurrent evidence can provide the parties
and the court with a number of advantages, such as:

1. In highly technical ﬁelds, experts may be better placed
to challenge another expert’s stated view than is the
judge or opposing counsel. Accordingly, by providing
the experts with freedom to question each other at the
joint meeting and throughout the hot-tub, the accur-
acy of each expert’s written view may be able to be
more effectively tested. Furthermore, experts in the
hot-tub can assist the Court by in effect ‘translating’
aspects of the other expert’s evidence which may be
unclear. This can result in the judge obtaining a better
understanding of the technology and a better basis for
forming a view on the merits.

2. The court gets the opportunity to see the different
demeanours of each expert in both the hot-tub and
cross-examination. This may assist the judge in reach-
ing conclusions about the expert’s evidence.

3. The experts are available to answer the judge’s ques-
tions and enhance the judge’s understanding. Judges
of the Federal Court of Australia have referred to the
ability to ask their own questions directly to the
experts as the primary beneﬁt of the hot-tub.

4. Counsel for the parties are still able to assist the hot-
tub process through objections (and in the absence of
the witnesses where needed). This can assist in ensur-
ing that the hot-tub does not stray into irrelevant ma-
terial or issues which have not been addressed in
afﬁdavit evidence.

It is clear that in intellectual property cases in the
Federal Court of Australia, concurrent evidence is here
to stay. Many Federal Court judges support concurrent
evidence and those who are not are free to elect not to
use it. The profession in Australia is currently consider-
ing proposals to clarify the hot tub process, not least for
the experts themselves.

Having looked at the system in Australia, what steps
have taken place in England and Wales to test whether
the use of concurrent evidence is appropriate in domes-
tic litigation?

The Manchester pilot
As explained earlier in this article, following Lord Justice
Jackson’s Final Report a pilot study was initiated in the

Manchester Technology and Construction Court and
Mercantile Court led by His Honour Judge Waksman
QC. That pilot study was monitored on behalf of Lord
Justice Jackson by the University College London Judi-
cial Institute, led by Professor Dame Hazel Genn.30 An
Interim Report was published by Dame Hazel Genn in
January 2012, detailing the procedures used for identify-
ing cases where concurrent evidence could be utilized,
the process for taking concurrent evidence and the
results of the study.31

As a ﬁrst stage, the pilot exercise involved judges iden-
tifying cases that were suitable for the use of concurrent
evidence. The court issued guidelines in June 2010 for
the voluntary participation in the pilot and it was agreed
that certain criteria would need to be considered by the
presiding judge, such as the complexity of the issues of
expert evidence, the importance of expert issues to the
case as a whole, the number of experts and areas of ex-
pertise and the extent to which the use of the concurrent
evidence procedure would be likely to help clarify or
understand expert issues and save time or costs at the
hearing. An important additional criterion was that con-
current evidence should not be used in cases where the
credibility or independence of any of the experts was in
doubt.

As of January 2012, over 15 cases had been identiﬁed
as suitable, and the parties involved in those cases had
agreed to use the concurrent evidence procedure. Those
cases involved expert evidence in the ﬁelds of tax, engin-
eering, accounting, surveying, information technology
and share valuations. However, of those 15 cases only
three proceeded to trial and none involved issues of
intellectual property.

The procedure used in those cases was set out in draft
guidelines which fell broadly into two sections: pre-trial
and during trial. Before trial, the court would make the
standard directions for permission to adduce expert evi-
dence and provision for the service of expert reports.
The court would also direct that the experts meet and
prepare a joint statement setting out the areas where
they agreed, and more importantly the areas where they
disagreed along with each expert’s position (with refer-
ences, where relevant, to particular sections of expert
reports). The parties were then directed to produce an
agreed agenda for the taking of concurrent evidence
based upon the joint statement. This should contain a
numbered list of the issues where the experts disagree
and should if possible be prepared in time for any

pre-trial review hearing. The judge would have the
opportunity to revise or supplement the agenda.

Immediately before the trial, the agenda would be
provided to each expert. At trial, the experts would be
sworn in one after each other and then together take
their place at the witness table. The judge would then
identify to the experts any signiﬁcant factual matters or
issues which had arisen during the course of the trial
before the experts had been sworn in. Then, in relation
to each issue on the agreed agenda, the judge would ini-
tiate a discussion by asking the experts, in turn, for their
views. The judge would then ask questions of each
expert about their views, and the judge would be able to
invite the experts to comment on each other’s views and
ask their own questions. Only after that process had
been carried out for the relevant issue, would the parties’
representatives be able to ask questions of each expert.
The guidelines stated that any questioning should be
designed to test the correctness of an expert’s given view,
or seek clariﬁcation of it, and it should not cover ground
which had already been fully explored. At the end of
the evidence, the judge would then seek to summarize
the experts’ respective positions on the issues and ask the
experts to conﬁrm or correct that summary.

After the trial of the three cases that reached that
stage, the judge, the barristers, the instructing solicitors
and the experts were all invited to complete question-
naires about
their experiences. The views were as
follows:
† The judges’ views were positive. They thought that
the use of concurrent evidence led to a large amount
of pre-reading before trial, but the agreed agenda
process and subsequent concurrent evidence led to
the judges gaining an immediate feel for the weight of
each side’s position. This led to issues being narrowed
quickly, and technical issues being more understand-
able. The concern raised by the judges was the use of
the procedure where there would be any attack on the
competence or impartiality of any of the experts.
† The parties’ representatives were also broadly positive.
They thought that the process was more efﬁcient and
that it was easier for the court to directly compare the
expert evidence. They also thought that hot-tubbing
was less adversarial, and that it encouraged greater ob-
jectivity on the part of the experts. There were,
however, some doubts as to the rigor of the process,
the difﬁculty for the barristers to prepare in advance,
and the potential savings in cost.

† The experts were also content with the process, con-
sidering it to be less adversarial, more efﬁcient, and
easier to explain any differences in opinions to the
judge in an immediate way.

The fact that the views expressed above were the product
of only three cases going through the full process means
that they are more a reﬂection of the views expressed by
the parties rather than a representative view of the wider
legal profession. However, Dame Hazel Genn believed
that some preliminary observations could be drawn,
such as the signiﬁcant beneﬁts as a procedure for enhan-
cing judicial decision-making, and the fact that there
was little evidence of any costs savings. The Interim
Report concluded by recommending that it was entirely
appropriate to include the use of concurrent evidence as
an optional procedure in civil litigation.

The authors of this article are aware that concurrent
evidence has also been used in a handful of UK cases
outside of the pilot study. For example, in the High Court
of Justice of Northern Ireland, Commercial Court, expert
witnesses on the issue of the valuation of a business were
examined by hot-tubbing.32 Mr Justice Weatherup noted
that the effect of the approach of concurrent evidence was
to ‘focus attention on the differences and to leave aside a
rehearsal of the matters not in dispute’. He added that
concurrent evidence proved to be a time-saving, cost-
saving exercise. The procedure has also been used by
Mr Justice Ramsay (the Judge now in charge of imple-
mentation of Lord Justice Jackson’s recommendations)
in two cases in the Technology & Construction Court
in London (Hi-Lite Electrical Limited v Wolseley UK
Limited33 and Harrison and others v Shepherd Homes
Limited34). In Harrison v Shepherd Homes, Mr Justice
Ramsay stated in his judgment that hot-tubbing ‘high-
lighted the extent of agreement between the experts and
also showed the limited differences in approach on which
I have had to make a decision’.

Conclusions and next steps
New provisions were introduced to the CPR on 1 April
2013 in order to implement Lord Justice Jackson’s
recommendations as to case and costs management. As
part of that package of amended rules, a new paragraph
11 was added to the Practice Direction to CPR 35 (the
chapter dealing with expert evidence). This provides
the judge with the discretion to direct that some or all of
the experts in a case from ‘like disciplines’ shall give their

expert concurrently. A short description of the proced-
ure to be used is set out in paragraph 11: the judge will
start the discussion by asking each expert for their views,
and may then ask questions; the experts may then be
invited to comment on the other experts’ views; the
parties’ representatives then have an opportunity to
question the experts, although full cross-examination is
not appropriate; ﬁnally, the judge will then summarize
the experts’ different positions and ask them to conﬁrm
the accuracy of the summary.

However, whether concurrent evidence will take off in
intellectual property cases in England and Wales remains
to be seen. The Manchester pilot study and the more
recent cases indicated that concurrent evidence can be
less adversarial and produce better quality expert evi-
dence for the judge. It is unknown whether it will save
cost, particularly in patent litigation where the major
cost of experts is not actual attendance at trial, but the
detailed preparation of expert reports. Furthermore, it is
foreseeable that there could be concerns amongst practi-
tioners of a loss of control both before trial at the
meeting of experts and in trial during the hot-tubbing
process. No doubt similar concerns will also be felt by
practitioners and litigants who are used to practising in
the controlled expert environment of US litigation.
Judges, however, may consider this process gets them
closer to the genuine substantive differences between the
experts than the more constrained and adversarial cross-
examination format. An additional complication could

be the view of the Chancery judiciary, the judges who
hear intellectual property cases in England. In their
March 2010 Response to Lord Justice Jackson’s Final
Report, the Chancery judges stated that they had no ex-
perience of the use of concurrent evidence, but thought
that certain types of cases could be the subject of a pilot,
giving as an example unfair prejudice applications by
shareholders which commonly give rise to complex
share valuation issues.35 This may or may not be
addressed further as part of the Chancery Modernisation
Review which was announced on 22 February 2013, and
is aimed at reviewing the current practices and proce-
dures for Chancery business in London in light of the
Jackson reforms.36 However, if hot-tubbing is to be used
effectively, it will need judges to prepare extensively and
control the concurrent evidence discussion.

That being said, it appears that at least some of the
English judiciary are poised to embrace the reforms—at
a speech to the Annual Bond Solon Expert Witness Con-
ference, Lord Justice Goldring (at that time the Senior
Presiding Judge) speciﬁcally addressed the issue of con-
current evidence:

Hot tubbing changes how experts engage with the parties,
each other and with the court. If it serves to limit and focus
the issues in the case, reduce the extent or opportunity for
long-winded or repetitive cross examination and saves court
time, hot tubbing must clearly be a step in the right direc-
tion. It will be interesting to see in how many cases parties
will choose hot tubbing next year. I hope many will.
