Protection of the Underwater

Cultural Heritage



The General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cul-
tural Organization, meeting in Paris from 15 October to 3 November 2001, at its
thirty-ﬁrst session,

Acknowledging the importance of underwater cultural heritage as an
integral part of the cultural heritage of humanity and a particularly
important element in the history of peoples, nations, and their relations
with each other concerning their common heritage, 

Realizing the importance of protecting and preserving the underwater
cultural heritage and that responsibility therefor rests with all States, 

Noting growing public interest in and public appreciation of underwater
cultural heritage,

Convinced of the importance of research, information and education to the
protection and preservation of underwater cultural heritage, 

Convinced of the public’s right to enjoy the educational and recreational
beneﬁts of responsible non-intrusive access to in situ underwater cultural
heritage, and of the value of public education to contribute to awareness,
appreciation and protection of that heritage, 

Aware of the fact that underwater cultural heritage is threatened by
unauthorized activities directed at it, and of the need for stronger measures
to prevent such activities, 

Conscious of the need to respond appropriately to the possible negative
impact on underwater cultural heritage of legitimate activities that may inci-
dentally affect it,

Deeply concerned by the increasing commercial exploitation of underwater
cultural heritage, and in particular by certain activities aimed at the sale,
acquisition or barter of underwater cultural heritage, 

Aware of the availability of advanced technology that enhances discovery of
and access to underwater cultural heritage, 

Believing that cooperation among States, international organizations,
scientiﬁc institutions, professional organizations, archaeologists, divers,
other interested parties and the public at large is essential for the protection
of underwater cultural heritage, 

Considering that survey, excavation and protection of underwater cultural
heritage necessitate the availability and application of special scientiﬁc
methods and the use of suitable techniques and equipment as well as a high
degree of professional specialization, all of which indicate a need for
uniform governing criteria, 

Realizing the need to codify and progressively develop rules relating to the
protection and preservation of underwater cultural heritage in conformity
with international law and practice, including the UNESCO Convention on
the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and
Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 14 November 1970, the
UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and
Natural Heritage of 16 November 1972 and the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, 

Committed to improving the effectiveness of measures at international,
regional and national levels for the preservation in situ or, if necessary for
scientiﬁc or protective purposes, the careful recovery of underwater cultural
heritage, 

Having decided at its twenty-ninth session that this question should be
made the subject of an international convention, 

Adopts this second day of November 2001 this Convention.

Rules concerning activities directed at underwater cultural heritage 

.   

Rule 1. The protection of underwater cultural heritage through in situ
preservation shall be considered as the ﬁrst option. Accordingly, activities
directed at underwater cultural heritage shall be authorized in a manner
consistent with the protection of that heritage, and subject to that require-
ment may be authorized for the purpose of making a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion to protection or knowledge or enhancement of underwater cultural
heritage. 
Rule 2. The commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage for
trade or speculation or its irretrievable dispersal is fundamentally incompat-
ible with the protection and proper management of underwater cultural
heritage. Underwater cultural heritage shall not be traded, sold, bought or
bartered as commercial goods. 
This Rule cannot be interpreted as preventing:

(a) the provision of professional archaeological services or necessary ser-
vices incidental thereto whose nature and purpose are in full conformity
with this Convention and are subject to the authorization of the compe-
tent authorities;

124     

(b) the deposition of underwater cultural heritage, recovered in the
course of a research project in conformity with this Convention, provid-
ed such deposition does not prejudice the scientiﬁc or cultural interest or
integrity of the recovered material or result in its irretrievable dispersal;
is in accordance with the provisions of Rules 33 and 34; and is subject to
the authorization of the competent authorities. 

Rule 3. Activities directed at underwater cultural heritage shall not adversely
affect the underwater cultural heritage more than is necessary for the objec-
tives of the project. 
Rule 4. Activities directed at underwater cultural heritage must use non-
destructive techniques and survey methods in preference to recovery of
objects. If excavation or recovery is necessary for the purpose of scientiﬁc
studies or for the ultimate protection of the underwater cultural heritage,
the methods and techniques used must be as non-destructive as possible
and contribute to the preservation of the remains. 
Rule 5. Activities directed at underwater cultural heritage shall avoid the
unnecessary disturbance of human remains or venerated sites. 
Rule 6. Activities directed at underwater cultural heritage shall be strictly
regulated to ensure proper recording of cultural, historical and archaeologi-
cal information. 
Rule 7. Public access to in situ underwater cultural heritage shall be pro-
moted, except where such access is incompatible with protection and man-
agement. 
Rule 8. International cooperation in the conduct of activities directed at
underwater cultural heritage shall be encouraged in order to further the
effective exchange or use of archaeologists and other relevant professionals. 

.   

Rule 9. Prior to any activity directed at underwater cultural heritage, a
project design for the activity shall be developed and submitted to the
competent authorities for authorization and appropriate peer review. 
Rule 10. The project design shall include:

(a) an evaluation of previous or preliminary studies;
(b) the project statement and objectives;
(c) the methodology to be used and the techniques to be employed;
(d) the anticipated funding;
(e) an expected timetable for completion of the project;
(f) the composition of the team and the qualiﬁcations, responsibilities
and experience of each team member;
(g) plans for post-ﬁeldwork analysis and other activities;

(h) a conservation programme for artefacts and the site in close
cooperation with the competent authorities; 
(i) a site management and maintenance policy for the whole duration of
the project;
(j) a documentation programme;
(k) a safety policy;
(l) an environmental policy;
(m) arrangements for collaboration with museums and other institutions,
in particular scientiﬁc institutions;
(n) report preparation;
(o) deposition of archives, including underwater cultural heritage
removed; and
(p) a programme for publication. 

Rule 11. Activities directed at underwater cultural heritage shall be carried
out in accordance with the project design approved by the competent
authorities. 
Rule 12. Where unexpected discoveries are made or circumstances change,
the project design shall be reviewed and amended with the approval of the
competent authorities. 
Rule 13. In cases of urgency or chance discoveries, activities directed at the
underwater cultural heritage, including conservation measures or activities
for a period of short duration, in particular site stabilization, may be autho-
rized in the absence of a project design in order to protect the underwater
cultural heritage. 

.   

Rule 14. The preliminary work referred to in Rule 10 (a) shall include an
assessment that evaluates the signiﬁcance and vulnerability of the
underwater cultural heritage and the surrounding natural environment to
damage by the proposed project, and the potential to obtain data that would
meet the project objectives. 
Rule 15. The assessment shall also include background studies of available
historical and archaeological evidence, the archaeological and environmental
characteristics of the site, and the consequences of any potential intrusion
for the long-term stability of the underwater cultural heritage affected by
the activities.
