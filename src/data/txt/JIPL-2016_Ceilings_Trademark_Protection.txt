Ceilings for trade mark protection: some
thoughts on s 92 TMA 1994
Jesus-Ivan Mora Gonzalez*

Introduction
In 2005 the Commission issued a proposal1 for a directive
on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement
of intellectual property rights as a reaction to the failed
attempt to introduce criminal law penalties in Directive
2004/48 EC2 on the enforcement of intellectual property
rights (Enforcement Directive). The proposal referred
particularly to piracy and counterfeiting as an ever-increa
sing problem linked to organized crime. Although this
proposal was
initially welcomed by the European
Parliament,3 it was not successful due to the lack of con-
sensus in the Council regarding EU (EU) criminal law
competence.4 In September 2010 the Commission with-
drew the proposal, afÔ¨Årming that it was unlikely to be able
to secure the implementation of the directive in the near
future.5 It did so, not because of uncertainty about whether
the criminal enforcement of intellectual property rights
was necessary, but because it planned to achieve the same
result through the ratiÔ¨Åcation of the Anti-Counterfeiting
Trade Agreement (ACTA).6 In 2011 the Commission rec-
ommended the ratiÔ¨Åcation of ACTA, but the European
Parliament, concerned by the continuing protests and res-
ervations about the Agreement, refused to do so.7 On 4
July 2012 ACTA was rejected by the European Parliament
(by 478 votes to 39, with 165 abstentions) based on the
lack of clarity in the wording of the legal provisions, espe-
cially concerning individual criminalization and commer-
cial scale, and the role of internet service providers.8

process: its top-down approach to law-making. The EU
should explain not just why harmonization is necessary,
but also why criminalization is required, especially
when there is no consensus with regard to the scope of
IP offences in EU Member States.9 The objective of this
article, however, is more modest. It aims only to high-
light the need for a bottom-up perspective on the crim-
inal enforcement of trade mark rights by means of a
discussion of the main difÔ¨Åculties that can be faced in s
92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (TMA 1994) regarding
the prosecution of genuine fake markets after cases like
R v Johnstone (2003),10 R v James Rupert Isaac (2004),11
R v Gary Boulter (2008)12 and R v Beazley (2013).13

Genuine fake markets in s 92 TMA 1994

In R v Johnstone, at paragraph 26 Lord Nicholls high-
lighted that:

Section 92 is concerned to prohibit the wrongful exploita-
tion of registered trade marks. It replaced section 58A of
the Trade Marks Act 1938. Section 58A made the fraudu-
lent use of a trade mark an offence. DifÔ¨Åculties arose in
practice in proving the necessary intent in cases where at
point of sale the trader disclaimed the authenticity of his
goods. The trader would describe his counterfeit products
as brand copies or genuine fakes. Section 92 avoids this
problem. In particular, intention to infringe a registered
trade mark is not an ingredient of the offence. Instead, sec-
tion 92 focuses simply on authorised use of a sign identical
to, or likely to be mistaken for a registered trade mark.

This optimistic view of s 92, however, was blurred in R
v James Rupert Isaac. The Court of Appeal quashed the
convictions that the Crown Court had imposed on
Rupert Isaac for the selling of sweatshirts bearing the
logos Boss and Polo for ¬£3 each on the basis of an in-
sufÔ¨Åcient direction in the questions about trade mark
use, ie the defendant‚Äôs intention in using the sign and
the prejudice to the function of the trade marks at issue.
Did the defendant prejudice the normal function of the
Boss and Polo trade marks?

According to the appellant, the sweatshirts bore no re-
semblance to the genuine items. It was not his intention to
suggest that these were genuine Boss or Polo items and he
did not believe that he was using the signs as trade marks.

the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the
European Economic and Social Committee, COM/2014/0392, 1 July
2014, EUR-lex-52014DC0392-EN.

Although the Court of Appeal did not accept the appel-
lant‚Äôs approach to genuine fake markets, it stressed that:

[W]here the defendant‚Äôs use of a mark is not intended by
him, or understood by the public, to be a designation of
origin, there can be no infringement because such use does
not prejudice the essential function of the registered mark
. . . [T]he direction given to the jury, with its reference to
use in the course of trade and prejudicing the function of
the trade mark was not sufÔ¨Åciently clear to permit this con-
viction to stand . . . [T]he jury must be directed that a
criminal offence is committed only when as a Ô¨Årst element
the offending sign is used as an indication of trade origin,
as explained in Johnstone . . . there was substantial room
for argument as to whether that was that case and the jury
should have had clear direction on that topic . . . [I]t
needed to be accompanied by a sufÔ¨Åcient direction on the
question of trade mark use . . . [T]his conviction is not, in
our judgement safe. The appellant, whatever mistakes were
made by counsel at the trial, was entitled to a direction in
accordance with the views expressed by the House of Lords
in Johnstone. It must follows that his appeal must be al-
lowed and the two convictions quashed.

It seems that this judgment ‚Äòreopened the door‚Äô to gen-
uine fake markets: a case for them may be formalized as
follows. Criminal enforcement of trade mark rights calls
into consideration two fundamental liberties: the liberty
to engage in a proscribed conduct (the commercializa-
tion of goods in a free market) and the liberty not to be
subject to the hard treatment and condemnation inher-
ent in punishment if the proscription is disregarded
(criminal penalties to proscribe the commercialization
of goods in a free market). The burden of these two
fundamental liberties should compel the identiÔ¨Åcation
of the legally protected interest that justiÔ¨Åes such re-
strictions in free competition and why that interest
should be enforced by criminal law. The legally pro-
tected interest to restrain free competition has tradi-
tionally been linked to the consumer right to be free
from confusion, deception or mistake; that is, trade
marks are valuable distinctive signs that foster con-
sumer‚Äôs trust that their expectations of the products
that bear the mark will be met and responsibility will lie
on producers. Trade marks, therefore, are not property
in the ordinary sense, but only distinctive signs indicat-
ing the origin of a commercial product.14 The trade

mark holder acquires only the right to forbid the goods
to which the mark is applied from being confused with
those of others and to prevent his own trade from being
diverted to competitors through their use of misleading
marks.15

Under the confusion doctrine, both consumers and
trade mark holders would be protected. Consumers
would be protected against inferior look-alikes while
trade mark holders would be motivated to produce
quality products to enhance their goodwill in the mar-
ketplace. Consequently, if consumers knew they were
buying genuine fakes and wished to acquire them as
imperfect substitutes that bearing the trade mark at a
lower price, the trade mark reputation of the original
source would not be damaged by the commercialization
of those goods and trade mark holders would be able to
continue selling the original products to those con-
sumers who were willing to pay a higher price for them.
After R v James Rupert Isaac the Court of Appeal in R
v Gary Boulter attempted once again to close the door to
genuine fake markets, by rejecting any possibility of re-
garding them as descriptive use which does not jeopardize
the guarantee of origin of the trade mark. The court high-
lighted, Ô¨Årst, the distinction between s 10(1) and (2)
TMA 1994, where the double identity case (identical signs
√æ identical goods) would exclude the need to take into
account the evidence of likelihood of confusion. Secondly,
by referring to Arsenal v Reed16 and R v Johnstone17 it
stressed that the quality of reproduction of the trade mark
is not relevant in these cases: holding otherwise would al-
low the sale goods expressly marketed as fakes. Thirdly, it
considered that the poor quality of counterfeit goods can-
not be used as a novel defence to reopen the door to peo-
ple selling widgets as genuine fakes. Accordingly,

the goods in this case did not involve the use of a trade
mark for a descriptive purpose but, as already stressed, was
pure counterfeiting. It self evidently damages the registered
proprietor of a trade mark if that proprietor is not able to
control the use of its logo as a badge of origin and if goods
of variable quality bearing that stamp are on the market.18

This approach to genuine fake markets was reinforced
in R v Beazley, a case in which the Court of Appeal high-
lighted a Lockean approach to trade mark rights. The de-
fendants had offered for sale wheel trims imported from
Italy and designed speciÔ¨Åcally for well-known marks of
motorcars, which ranged alphabetically between BMW
and Volkswagen. The wheel trims bore the logos of the

relevant manufacturers and were marketed by the defen-
dants as ‚Äònon-genuine replacement parts‚Äô under advertise-
ments such as:
‚ÄòVauxhall Astra Part (and a number).
These wheel trims are not produced from the car manu-
facturer but made to the same if not better product offer-
ing a high quality lasting product for your vehicle.‚Äô19

The defendants alleged the existence of a reasonable
belief under s 92(5) TMA 1994. They claimed that they
had good character since they had marketed the goods as
‚Äònon-genuine replacement parts‚Äô rather than pretending
that they had been made by the car manufacturer and
furthermore the Italian manufacturers had escaped prose-
cution in Italy. The Court of Appeal, however, rejected
both arguments, ruling that the commercialization of
‚Äònon-genuine replacement parts‚Äô was not a venial offence,
but constituted real damage to the trade mark holder,
and the fact that the Italian manufacturer‚Äôs representative
had given evidence in the trial that a prosecution against
it had failed in Italy was irrelevant under section 92(5)
TMA 1994. According to the Court of Appeal:

even if the goods are marketed in the way that these were
here, they look as if they are real Volkswagen or Vauxhall
or whatever trims and they are not. They are depriving the
manufacturers of the legitimate fruits of all the research
and development
through which they developed their
products. That is why trade mark exists.20

Although the judgments in R v Gary Boulter and R v
Beazley clariÔ¨Åed that counterfeiting invariably amounts
to unfair competition and the context where the prod-
ucts were sold in the marketplace (poor quality, low
prices or disclaimers that literally say ‚Äònon-genuine
product or replacement parts‚Äô, among others) should
not be taken into account as a relevant factor to delegit-
imize the criminal enforcement of trade mark exclusive
rights, closing the door‚Äô to genuine fake markets is sub-
ject to some hermeneutic difÔ¨Åculties, which will be ex-
plained the following two sections.

The proof of likelihood of confusion is
not relevant to delimit the scope of s 92
TMA 1994

One of the key questions discussed in R v Johnstone was
whether trade mark use was a necessary ingredient of
criminal liability under s 92 TMA 1994. Lord Nicholls
answered afÔ¨Årmatively, holding that:

[T]he essence of the trade mark has always been that it is a
badge of origin. It indicates trade source: a connection in
the course of trade between the goods and the proprietor
of the mark . . . there is still no reason why other people
should not be free to use the words in a descriptive sense,
and not in any trade mark sense.21

Section 92 TMA 1994, therefore, is to be interpreted as
applying only when the offending sign is used as an in-
dication of trade origin. If descriptive use of the trade
mark, even in double identity cases (identical sign √æ
identical product), is excluded from the scope of s 92
TMA 1994, could the commercialization of genuine
fakes be regarded as a descriptive use of the trade mark
at hand and be excluded as well?

The appellant in R v James Rupert Isaac claimed that
his sweatshirts bore no resemblance to the genuine
trade mark items (Boss and Polo) and that he did not
believe that he was using the signs as trade marks. That
approach was conÔ¨Årmed by the appellant in R v Gary
Boulter when he claimed that the material was of such
poor quality that no one could think that its trade ori-
gin was that of the trade mark owner, ie that use would
not jeopardize the guarantee of origin, which consti-
tuted the essential function of trade mark rights accord-
ing to the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU) in in Arsenal Football Club plc v Reed.22

The Court of Appeal in R v Gary Boulter, however,
rejected that approach to the guarantee of origin and
highlighted the distinction between s 10(1) and (2)
TMA 1994. The goods in that case did not involve the
use of a trade mark for descriptive purposes. It was sim-
ply a case of commercialization of counterfeit goods
where the trade mark owner would not be able to con-
trol the use of its logo as a badge of origin; that is, the
context where the products have been sold should be
excluded as an essential ingredient to delimit the scope
of the trade mark offence under s 92 TMA 1994. In ad-
dition, the double identity requirement, which is laid
down in s 10(1) TMA 1994, would have no relevance
for the proof of likelihood of confusion as that statu-
tory provision only applies to similarity-based cases,
that is: identical signs √æ similar goods, similar signs √æ
identical goods and similar signs √æ similar signs.

This approach could be called the ‚Äònon-contextualist
test‚Äô and it would based on double identity cases (iden-
tical signs √æ identical goods) with the aim of highlight-
ing
are
commercialized (poor quality or low prices, among

in which the

context

goods

that

the

others) should be deprived of any hermeneutic value.
The ‚Äònon-contextualist test‚Äô could Ô¨Åt well with the
CJEU‚Äôs interpretation of indication of origin based on
the trade mark holder‚Äôs responsibility for quality con-
trol regarding the commercialization of the products
that bear the mark. In the early case Hag II,23 the CJEU
held that:

[T]rade mark rights are an essential element in the system
of undistorted competition which the Treaty seeks to estab-
lish and maintain. Under such a system, an undertaking
must be in a position to keep its customers by virtue of the
quality of its products and services, something which is
possible if there are distinctive marks which enable cus-
tomers to identify those products and services. For the
trade mark to be able to fulÔ¨Ål this role, it must offer a guar-
antee that all goods bearing it have been produced under
the control of a single undertaking which is accountable
for their quality.24

Consequently, the guarantee on the quality control of
those goods that bear the mark underlies the relevance
of the trade mark holder‚Äôs exclusive rights and the irrel-
evance of the context as a disclaimer to disprove the ex-
istence of
risk of consumer confusion. And this
approach obviously Ô¨Åts well with the underlying policy
of the non-contextualist test: if the proof of consumer
confusion is used as a strategy by trade mark infringers
to justify the selling of genuine fakes at lower prices, the
proof of consumer confusion should be removed as an
essential ingredient under s 92 TMA 1994 in double
identity cases (identical signs √æ identical goods).

Double identity cases, however, could be subject to
the following counter-arguments. First, it seems that
the lack of a statutory requirement for any evidence of
likelihood of confusion in double identity cases is an at-
tractive way of avoiding the problem faced by genuine
fake markets. If the main difÔ¨Åculty lied in proving con-
sumer confusion when no-one could think that a prod-
uct‚Äôs trade origin is that of the trade mark owner, the
quickest way to solve that difÔ¨Åculty would be to remove
that requirement, ie if there is a double identity case it
is not necessary to prove likelihood of confusion. But
that approach raises a question with regard to cases
where there is no double identity and the requirement
to prove likelihood of confusion is laid down in the
statutory wording under s 10(2) TMA 1994. Should the
context as a disclaimer of the trade mark origin be
taken into account to claim that genuine fake markets
should not be criminalized as they are not likely to

jeopardize the guarantee of origin? In fact, double iden-
tity cases, which are laid down in s 10(1) of TMA 1994,
take into account the evidence of consumer confusion,
but that evidence is examined in the abstract where the
context as a disclaimer of the origin is meaningless. The
proof of likelihood of confusion is not relevant because
when there is no descriptive use of the trade mark at
hand and the signs and goods are identical it is pre-
sumed iuris et de iure that the guarantee of origin has
been jeopardized. The reality, however,
is that con-
sumers are not misled about the real origin of goods:
they simply want to acquire them with the aim of gain-
ing imperfect substitutes that bear the logo of the trade
mark at a lower price. Would it be possible to claim
that a praesumptio iuris et de iure regarding the evidence
of consumer confusion in double identity cases should
be replaced by a praesumptio iuris tantum since descrip-
tive uses of the trade mark would prove that‚Äîeven in
double identity cases‚Äîthe trade mark holder is only
granted a property right to guarantee the origin of the
goods? Could genuine fake markets be subject to that
praesumptio iuris tantum under s 92 TMA 1994?

In addition, it is difÔ¨Åcult for a reasonable person to
foresee hypothetical scenarios under s 92(5) TMA 1994.
Although the context as a disclaimer of the trade origin
is not taken into account in s 10 (1) TMA 1994, this
does not necessarily mean that the context in which the
trade mark is commercialized is not relevant to inform
consumers about the real origin of the goods. What the
CJEU seems to afÔ¨Årm is that the guarantee of quality
control is a means of achieving the normative target of
enabling consumers, without any possibility of confu-
sion, to distinguish products from others that have an-
other origin. The quality control (means), therefore,
would make perfect sense when consumers are misled
about the origin of the product as the trade mark
holder would not be able to guarantee the identity of
the origin of the product (target). However, the neces-
sity of that guarantee is more questionable when con-
sumers are not misled about the origin of the product

and they are willing to acquire simply imperfect goods
that bear the logo of a famous mark.

The alternative to solve the difÔ¨Åculties faced by the
‚Äònon-contextualist test‚Äô, could be the statutory provi-
sion laid down in s 92(4) TMA 1994:

A person does not commit an offence under this section
unless (a) the goods are goods in respect of which the trade
mark is registered, or (b) the trade mark has a reputation
in the United Kingdom and the use of the sign takes or
would take unfair advantage of, or is or would be detri-
mental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the
trade mark.

If the aim of genuine fake markets is not to mislead
consumers about the real origin of goods, but to be a
parasite on trade mark reputation by offering goods
that bear the logo of a famous mark at a lower price,
the key issue to be discussed should not be whether the
trade mark use jeopardizes the guarantee of origin, but
whether genuine fake markets take unfair advantage or
damage the reputation of marks with a repute.

Directive 2008/95/EC (the Trade Mark Directive,
Arts 5 and 8)25 and Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/
2009 (Articles 8 and 9)26 delimit the protection of well-
known marks by proof of a detriment on the distinctive
character of the mark (dilution by blurring), proof of a
detriment on the repute of the mark (dilution by tarn-
ishment) or taking unfair advantage of the distinctive
character or reputation of the mark. The CJEU deÔ¨Ånes
well-known marks as brands that are recognized by a
relevant part of consumers in a relevant territory of the
EU and afÔ¨Årms that the scope of exclusive rights for
well-known marks should be broader than for those
distinctive signs that are not famous.27 This broader
scope for marks with reputation is explained further in
L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure,28 and has been applied in cases such
as Red Bull v Sun Mark (2012),29 Jack Wills v House of
Fraser (2014),30 Conde Nast v Vogue (2015)31 and
Bayerische Motoren v Technosport London (2016).32

In L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure, the CJEU held that trade mark

the Trade Mark Directive, are the consequence of a cer-
tain degree of similarity between the mark and the sign,
by virtue of which the relevant section of the public
makes a connection between the sign and the mark,
that is, establishes a link between them without confus-
ing them. It is not necessary, however, that the degree
of similarity is such that there exists a likelihood of con-
fusion, but it is sufÔ¨Åcient that the degree of similarity
has the effect of establishing a link between the sign and
the famous mark.33 Even if the proof of this link is con-
ditio a sine qua non for the proof of a trade mark in-
fringement, it is not sufÔ¨Åcient to afÔ¨Årm the existence of
taking unfair advantage of, or being detrimental to, the
distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark.
The CJEU, with the aim of delimiting the scope of
Article 5(2) Directive 89/104/EEC (First Council
Directive),34 developed the requirements for this kind
of injury in further detail:

(i) Detriment to the distinctive character of the mark
(dilution by blurring): this is caused when the
ability of the mark to identify the goods or services
for which it is registered is weakened as the use of
an identical or similar sign by a third party leads
to dispersion of the identity and hold upon the
public mind of the earlier mark. Further to Intel
Corporation v CPM United Kingdom,35 the proof
of dilution by blurring requires evidence of a
change in the economic behaviour of the average
consumer of the goods or services for which the
earlier mark was registered or a serious likelihood
that such a change will occur in the future.36

(ii) Detriment to the reputation of the mark (dilution
by tarnishment): this is caused when the goods or
services for which the identical or similar sign is
used by the third party may be perceived by the
public in such a way that the trade mark‚Äôs power
of attraction is reduced, especially when it has a
negative impact on the image of the mark.37

(iii) Taking unfair advantage of the distinctive character
or reputation of the mark (parasitic behaviour or
free-riding): this covers cases where, by reason of a
transfer of the image of the mark or of the charac-
teristics that it projects to the goods identiÔ¨Åed by the
identical or similar sign, there is clear exploitation

on the coat-tails of the mark with a reputation. In
order to determine whether the use of a sign takes
unfair advantage of the distinctive character or re-
pute of the mark, it is necessary to undertake a
global assessment, taking into account all factors rel-
evant to the circumstances of the case, which include
the strength of the reputation of the mark, the de-
gree of distinctive character of the mark, the degree
of similarity between the marks at issue and the na-
ture and degree of proximity of the goods or services
concerned. The CJEU links this modality to the
functions of trade marks, which are not only an in-
dication of origin, but also serve the functions of
communication, investment and advertising.38

The last modality of injury played a very important
role in Red Bull v Sun Mark and BMW v Technosport
London. In the Ô¨Årst case, Red Bull alleged that Sun Mark
had infringed the trade mark ‚ÄòBULLIT‚Äô through the use
of the sign ‚ÄòBULLET‚Äô in relation to an energy drink and
the trade mark ‚ÄòRED BULL‚Äô through the use of the adver-
tising slogan or strapline ‚ÄòNO BULL IN THIS CAN‚Äô. The
claim concerning ‚ÄòNO BULL IN THIS CAN‚Äô was mainly
addressed under Article 9(1)(c) of Council Regulation
40/94/EC.39 The court afÔ¨Årmed that the proof of a trade
mark infringement under this provision requires evidence
be shown of the reputation of the mark, a globally appre-
ciated link between the signs and taking unfair advantage
of the distinctive character or reputation of the famous
mark. The court held that this advertising slogan was a
trade mark infringement. It did so by referring to General
Motors v Yplan40 to deÔ¨Åne the reputation of the mark,
Intel Corp v CPM41 to Ô¨Ånd a globally appreciated link be-
tween the signs, and L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure42 to delimit the
scope of taking unfair advantage of the distinctive charac-
ter or reputation. According to the court:

the

In effect,

Red Bull contends that the strapline takes advantages of the
repute of RED BULL to promote the defendant‚Äôs drink. I
agree with this.
say to the
consumers: <Here‚Äôs an energy drink which is as good as the
famous RED BULL drink with which you are familiar, but
cheaper > . . . Red Bull contends this is unfair because it en-
ables the defendants to take the beneÔ¨Åt of the substantial
sums which Red Bull has spent on advertising and promoting
RED BULL, and of its resulting reputation, and thereby to
save money on advertising and promoting their own product

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 9

. . .Taking all the circumstances into account, I conclude that
the strapline does take unfair advantage of the repute.43

In BMW v Technosport, the defendant (Technosport)
was a company dealing with the repair and mainte-
nance of cars in North London. Technosport (TLL) had
used signs identical to BMW‚Äôs trade marks (the BMW
word and roundel) in the course of its business. BMW
claimed that in doing this, TLL had infringed its trade
marks and passed off its service as being associated with
or approved by BMW. The defendant denied both trade
mark infringement and passing off, claiming that its use
of BMW‚Äôs signs did no more than accurately conveying
the message that TLL was a garage specializing in the
maintenance and repair of BMW cars. The Intellectual
Property Enterprise Court, however, held that TLL had
taken unfair advantage of reputation through the use of
the BMW roundel under the hermeneutic criterion es-
tablished in L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure:

There is nothing in the case law to preclude the court from
concluding in an appropriate case that the use of a sign the
objective effect of which is to enable the defendant to bene-
Ô¨Åt from the reputation and goodwill of the trade mark
amounts to unfair advantage even if it is not proved that
the defendant subjectively intended to exploit that reputa-
tion and goodwill . . . I have found that the roundel signs
used by TLL did convey to the average consumer that TLL
was an authorised dealer . . . It is the objective effect of the
use of the mark that matters, not the user‚Äôs subjective in-
tention. TLL‚Äôs use of its roundel signs therefore took unfair
advantage of the repute of the Roundel.44

It follows that the judgment in L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure could
provide an attractive strategy to delimit the scope of s
92 TMA 1994. The criminalization of genuine fake mar-
kets could be easily justiÔ¨Åed by claiming that the pro-
tection of property rights in the trade mark should be
the underlying criminal policy and the production, dis-
tribution and selling of products that bear the trade
mark without the consent of the trade mark holder
should be regarded as a trade mark misappropriation
under s 92 TMA 1994.

This approach, however, presents some difÔ¨Åculties.
First, the statutory provision in s 92(4) TMA 1994 might
not be necessarily interpreted in that way. The proof of
taking unfair advantage or being detrimental to the repute
of the trade mark could be interpreted as conditio sine qua
non that must be taken into account for the analysis of

any evidence of likelihood of consumer confusion and as
an essential ingredient of the indication of origin to justify
a criminal sanction under s 92(4) TMA 1994. Secondly, if
the principles of legality and proportionality are consid-
ered essential pillars of a democratic society, any individ-
ual should be entitled to have an indication of the legal
rules applicable to any criminal process and be able to
foresee the consequences of his actions, in particular to
avoid any disproportionate punishment. The criminal en-
forcement of trade mark exclusive rights therefore, could
arise merely because the trade mark holder fears that its
product would be aligned with an unsavoury mental asso-
ciation that citizens should reject or a mere detriment on
the power of attraction with the potential to affect the in-
vestment or advertisement functions of the famous mark.
This normative approach, however, could turn trade
mark protection upside down. Whereas traditional trade
mark theory protects vulnerable consumers from confu-
sion as to the source of goods or services, the criminaliza-
tion of genuine fake markets would protect the largest
corporations from consumers who are not loyal to the
trade mark owner; that is, consumer loyalty to the trade
mark holder could be regarded as a legally protected inter-
est under s 92 TMA 1994.

The proof of likelihood of confusion is
relevant to delimit the scope of s 92
TMA 1994

The alternative to the normative irrelevance for the
proof of consumer confusion in genuine fake markets
could be its acceptance as a more realistic approach to
the guarantee of origin, but projected in the whole con-
text where genuine fakes reach real and potential cli-
ents. That approach is known in American law as post-
sale confusion test.45 It seeks to examine any evidence
of consumer confusion not from the average consumer
perspective who buys genuine fakes at the point of sale,
but from the general public perspective (real and poten-
tial clients) in post-sale contexts where the proof of
consumer confusion at the point of sale is irrelevant.
Personal use of the trade mark by those consumers who
buy a genuine fake could lead individuals, other than
the real purchasers, to believe mistakenly that a product
was manufactured by the trade mark holder. The trade

mark holder‚Äôs loss would be justiÔ¨Åed through the dam-
age to the trade mark reputation as sellers of genuine
fakes offer those goods to consumers and those sellers
allow consumers to acquire the prestige of owning what
appears to be the more expensive product. A loss in
trade mark reputation, therefore, could occur when a
sophisticated buyer purchases a genuine fake and passes
it off to the public as the genuine article, thereby con-
fusing the viewing public and achieving the status of
the genuine article at a knockoff price.

Arsenal46 and Corporation v Eagle Technologies
(2011)47 are remarkable examples of this approach. The
Ô¨Årst case concerned the selling and offering for sale by
Mr Reed of scarves marked in large lettering with the
word ‚ÄòARSENAL‚Äô, a word that is registered as a trade
mark by Arsenal Football Club for those and other
goods. Mr Reed claimed that the consumers of his
products would not be misled about their real origin as
he let the consumers know that his products did not
come from any ofÔ¨Åcial shop of Arsenal Football Club.
Further to a reference for a preliminary ruling, the
CJEU held that the presence on Mr Reed‚Äôs stall of the
notice stating that the goods at issue in the main pro-
ceedings are not ofÔ¨Åcial Arsenal FC products would not
be relevant to avoid infringement:

Even on the assumption that such a notice may be relied
on by a third party as a defence to an action for trade mark
infringement, there is a clear possibility in the present case
that some consumers, in particular if they come across the
goods after they have been sold by Mr. Reed and taken
away from the stall where the notice appears, may interpret
the sign as designating Arsenal FC as the undertaking of or-
igin of the goods.48

In DataCard Corp v Eagle Technologies, DataCard
Corp claimed that Eagle Technologies had infringed its
trade mark ‚ÄòDATACARD;
in respect of labels applied to
ribbon packaging on the websites that the defendant
managed for its resellers. Eagle Technologies denied any
trade mark infringement on grounds that the use at
hand was necessary to indicate that its ribbons were
compatible with the printers of DataCard Corp and the
context of that use was sufÔ¨Åcient to avoid likelihood of
confusion. The High Court of Justice of England and
Wales rejected the defendant‚Äôs arguments and held that
the use of DATACARD by Eagle Technologies amounted
to trade mark infringement. The High Court of Justice,
concerning the post-sale confusion doctrine, held that:

On balance, it seems to me that the case law of the Court
of Justice supports the proposition that post-sale confusion

can be relied upon in support of a claim under article 5(1)
b [of the First Council Directive] This is most clearly the
case in respect of the labels . . . even if the consumers were
not confused at the time of purchase and such confusion
only arose after purchase, that is immaterial . . . .49

The aim of the post-sale confusion test is clear. If the
point of sale as a disclaimer of the trade origin is the main
hermeneutic difÔ¨Åculty in forbidding the commercializa-
tion of genuine fakes, the point of sale should be removed
and replaced by a post-sale context that enables trade
mark holders to prove the existence of the risk of con-
sumer confusion. This approach, however, faces some dif-
Ô¨Åculties in justifying a criminal sanction under s 92 TMA
1994. This is, Ô¨Årst, because of a distortion in the source
theory. Trade mark exclusive rights are extended to the
hypothetical and futuristic behaviour of real purchasers of
genuine fakes when they interact with other individuals
that could be potential consumers of genuine goods or
simply snobs who could feel ‚Äòdisappointed‚Äô or ‚Äòoffended‚Äô
by a loss of their social distinctiveness. Any evidence of
likelihood of consumer confusion is examined in a con-
text where the point of sale has no legal value, but this
context is simply hypothetical. At the point of sale, con-
sumers are not misled about the real origin of goods; they
simply want to acquire those goods with the aim of gain-
ing the logo of the famous mark at a lower price, ie the
proof of consumer confusion is transformed dramatically.
The traditional relationship between consumers and trade
mark holders would be replaced by a peer-to-peer con-
sumer interrelationship based on wealth signalling and so-
cial distinction. This is secondly because the person who
sells genuine fakes knows simply a context as a disclaimer
of trade origin that is useful for those consumers who are
willing to acquire those products. In this scenario, the
seller would be responsible for a futuristic and hypotheti-
cal scenario where citizens could bear or simply contem-
plate the logo of the trade mark. It seems unreasonable
under s 92(5) TMA 1994 to justify a criminal sanction
based on the extension of the proof of mens rea to this
futuristic behaviour in post-sale contexts when the seller
of genuine fakes knows simply that consumers cannot be
confused about the source of the goods because of the
context in which the genuine fakes are commercialized.
This is because the capability of genuine fakes to be
viewed and examined by the general public becomes an
arbitrary hermeneutic approach in deciding what kind of
uncompetitive behaviour should be enforced by a crimi-
nal sanction with the ability to marginalize all those cases
where genuine fakes are not displayed in public.

Conclusion

R v James Rupert Isaac seemed to open the door to
genuine fake markets when it was supposed that R v
Johnstone had closed it. R v Gary Boulter and R v
Beazley attempted to close the door once again to
those markets based on the double identity case as
laid down in s 10(1) TMA 1994 and the impossibility
of considering the context where the goods are sold as
a disclaimer and essential element to disprove any evi-
likelihood of confusion. Both judgments,

implement a bottom-up approach to law-making in
the EU) are not welcome, but the price to be paid for
this should not be the enforcement of property rights
in distinctive signs without considering the social di-
mension of indication of origin to help consumers
make informed decisions about the source of the
products they buy.
