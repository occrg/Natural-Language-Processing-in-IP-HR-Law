Notes on contributor
Aron Mazel is a Reader in Heritage Studies in the Media, Culture, Heritage (MCH) subject area at Newcastle University 
(UK). Aron had a 25-year career in archaeological research and heritage and museum management in South Africa 
(SA) before he moved to the UK in 2002. His primary research activities in South Africa revolved around the docu-
mentation and management of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg rock paintings and the excavation of 15 rock shelters in 
the Thukela basin. Posts he held in SA included Assistant Director of the Natal Museum (1994–1997) and Director of 
the SA Cultural History Museum (1998–2002). In the UK, Aron managed the Arts and Humanities Research Board 
funded Beckensall Northumberland Rock Art Website Project at Newcastle University (2002–2004), which won the 
2006 Channel 4 ICT British Archaeological Award. Since 2009, Aron has been the Principal Investigator on two Arts 
and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)/Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and one AHRC funded 
projects dealing with (i) the decay of rock art and (ii) the interpretation of rock art using mobile phones. In addition, he 
has co-led a European Commission funded project dealing with the safeguarding of heritage in the UK, Guyana, Kenya 
and China. Book publications during the last decade include Tracks in a Mountain Range: exploring of the history of 
the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg (2007, with John Wright), Art as Metaphor: The Prehistoric Rock- Art of Britain (2007, 
co-edited with George Nash and Clive Waddington), and uKhahlamba: Umlando wezintaba zoKhahlamba/History of 
the uKhahlamba (2012, with John Wright).
