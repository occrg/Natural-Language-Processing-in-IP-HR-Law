anthropogenic” (i.e., originating in human activity) greenhouse gas concentra-
tion.1 Consistent with this finding, the prime focus of the current climate change
regime led by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN-
FCCC) is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.2

The UNFCCC’s utilitarian focus leaves certain aspects of cultural heritage on
the sidelines of debate and policy. To what extent does climate change influence
cultural heritage? Capturing a causal link between climate change and ever-changing
cultural heritage presents a serious challenge. The distinction between normal cli-
matic variability and anthropogenic causes adds complexity to such a determina-
tion. Recent observations that climate change increasingly makes people move
appear to provide an existential foundation for linking climate causes and cultural
heritage effects. As discussed in the following text, experts warn that one of the
gravest effects of climate change concerns human mobility.3 In other words, a sig-
nificant number of people are likely to be forced to, or to voluntarily leave their
homeland because of, for example, shoreline erosion, coastal flooding, and agri-
cultural disruption.4 Countries with populations on the verge of such displace-
ment note that the impact of climate change concerns their survival and security,
and “the cultural identity of an entire nation is under threat.”5

So far, the adverse effects of climate change on cultural heritage tend to be con-
sidered primarily in connection with tangible or physical cultural properties, such
as buildings, monuments, or archeological sites destroyed by extreme weather
events.6 Conversely, the effects of climate change on less tangible cultural heritage
such as the loss of oral tradition and languages have been receiving less attention.7
While the interaction between climate change and cultural heritage has a range
of tangible and intangible dimensions, the present article focuses on the “intan-
gible aspects of cultural heritage”8 as affected by climate change. It explores legal
and policy options to place climate change considerations in the context of on-
going efforts to protect intangible cultural heritage within the relevant inter-
national legal frameworks.

The second section of the article provides some factual background on climate
change-driven migration in and from countries such as the Small Island Devel-
oping States (SIDS).9 Where climate change combines with generally weak law
and policy for culture and traditions, some SIDS may face significant cultural loss
in the years to come. To support this assessment, this section also presents selected
statistics and data relevant to climate change displacement and cultural heritage
in these regions.

Against this background of climate change displacement and vulnerability of
cultural heritage, the third section of the article looks at several existing climate
change-related international legal frameworks applicable to the protection of in-
tangible cultural heritage. In terms of the relationship between climate change and
cultural heritage, the climate change regime under the UNFCCC primarily recog-
nizes the usefulness of traditional knowledge in the context of climate change ad-
aptation. This acknowledges the role of local knowledge systems in the way in

CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING CULTURE

which local communities understand and adapt to changes in climate.10 This sec-
tion also touches on the risk management approach of UNESCO and principles
under international refugee law to protect cultural rights of refugees.

The fourth section of the article draws attention to lessons from policymaking
efforts on shaping a sui generis rights-based system for protecting “traditional
cultural expressions” or “expressions of folklore”11 complementing any existing
intellectual property-based protection through the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and certain regional intellectual property authorities. On
the basis of those efforts, this section explores certain law and policy options to
enhance the protection of intangible cultural heritage against cultural loss trig-
gered by climate change displacement.

BACKGROUND: CLIMATE CHANGE DISPLACEMENT

AND CULTURAL HERITAGE

Climate Change Makes More People Move

The frequency and severity of certain hazards combined with vulnerability have been
generally attributed to climate change.12 The IPCC, which assesses scientific, tech-
nical, and socioeconomic information relevant to the understanding of climate
change,13 notes migration as one of the likely key consequences of climate change,14
without asserting any “monocausal relationship.”15 International agencies con-
cerned with migration and displacement observe that “gradual and sudden envi-
ronmental changes are already resulting, with anywhere between 50 and 200 million
people moving as a result [of rising sea levels, floods, droughts, famine and hurri-
canes] by the middle of the century, either within their countries or across borders,
on a permanent or temporary basis.”16 (However, in the absence of a harmonized
definition of climate change displacement17 and baseline information on levels of
climate change causing displacement,18 such estimates may vary.)

To answer basic qualitative and quantitative questions,19 the Inter-Agency Stand-
ing Committee (IASC), a mechanism for inter-agency coordination of humani-
tarian assistance among key United Nations (UN) and non-UN humanitarian
organizations,20 set up an expert group in 2008. Taking an existing categorization
for internally displaced persons as a basis, this expert group developed a typology
classifying causes of movement, nature of movement, and existing legal frame-
works for those moving within or beyond borders.21

The first category is “sudden-onset disaster displacement”22 such as floods and
storms: for example, 36 million people in 2008 (including 15 million in the Si-
chuan earthquake in China alone).23 The second category is “slow-onset disaster
displacement”24 such as drought.25 The third category, singled out from the sec-
ond, is displacement linked to sea-level rise.

262

Climate change displacement linked to sea-level rise is predicted to grow expo-
nentially,26 particularly in SIDS, Africa,27 the Asian mega deltas, and the polar re-
gions.28 Four relocation cases are often dubbed as “the climate canaries”29 heralding
such trends: the Cartaret islands in Papua New Guinea,30 the Lateu village in Van-
uatu,31 the Shishmaref village on Sarichef island in Alaska,32 and the submerged
Lohachara island in India’s Hooghly River.33

While in many cases climate change-displaced persons remain within their coun-
try, some may cross borders, into an uncertain legal status.34 In particular, SIDS
have been considering the prospect of international climate change relocation. For
example, in 2008 the president of the Maldives announced that the government
would begin to divert a portion of the country’s tourist revenue to buying a new
homeland as an insurance policy against climate change.35 He says Sri Lanka and
India are regarded as suitable destinations because of their similar cultures, cuisines,
and climates; and Australia is under consideration because of its vast unoccupied
land.36

Kiribati is also looking to acquire land elsewhere so as to relocate communities
in danger of being uprooted by rising sea levels.37 Its government has been trying
to secure enhanced labor migration options such as nursing, with an initial target
of about 1,000 citizens annually to work in Australia and New Zealand.38 Through
remittances, such migrants can support their extended family members remain-
ing in Kiribati.39

It should be noted that relocation between islands or abroad is increasingly com-
mon for Pacific islanders. For instance, Tuvalu is a small coral atoll nation—0.1
times the size of Washington, DC—with the highest point reaching only 16 feet
above average sea level.40 It is often depicted as one of the areas most vulnerable
to climate change.41 It had an estimated population of 10,000 as of July 2010.42 A
significant number of additional Tuvaluans have left, including some 3,000 to New
Zealand, 300 to Australia, and others to the United States.43 Such migration re-
portedly is motivated by environmental concerns, such as sea-level rise, tidal flood-
ing, and salinity of limited arable land, in addition to other economic, political,
and social reasons.44

The Vulnerability of Cultural Heritage to Climate Change
Displacement

When climate change causes migration, what does this mean for the cultural her-
itage of the land left behind? It has been observed that refugee camps generally
show a high level of cultural activity.45 This phenomenon has been explained as
“an empowering way of securing continuity and some semblance of stability” while
“enabling [the refugees] to experiment with” new identities, strategies for adapta-
tion and survival.46 Indeed, maintaining cultural values and traditions on a longer-
term basis after settling in a foreign country poses a significant challenge.

CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING CULTURE

263

A survey of the Tuvaluan community in New Zealand observes that, “although
community-based culture is still evident through their church activities, island cel-
ebration functions and sports events, they are not as strong as back home in the
islands.”47 Reported reasons include the changes in lifestyle and financial condi-
tions that come with living in New Zealand.48 Naturally, the traditional Tuvaluan
culture blends with that of New Zealand, with the dispersed nature of Tuvaluan
settlement in the country further diluting the community-based culture.49

Not only those who have left, but also those still on the islands experience “a
deep sense of ‘loss’ or at least an expectation of inevitable looming ‘loss’ of place
of the home islands which form the very core of their identities.”50 The loss of
their culture and traditions is mentioned as one of the biggest concerns of South
Pacific islanders preparing to move.51 Such feelings of “losing ground” are hardly
surprising, because the relationship of indigenous peoples to their land is partic-
ularly important to their sovereignty and identity: Will they be able to maintain
their culture on foreign soil?52

Few available statistics specifically document the extent of climate change-
related vulnerabilities of cultural heritage.53 Within the limits of this article, it may
be useful to review certain indicators pertaining to SIDS: for example, whether or
not a country is a member of UNESCO; the extent of UNESCO-listed cultural
heritage; and the number of languages in the SIDS. Partial and secondary as some
of these data may be, they do suggest that protecting the SIDS’ cultural heritage
from the effects of climate change is more than an academic concern.54

In terms of natural and tangible cultural heritage protection, all of the 38 SIDS
that are UN members have also joined the UNFCCC and UNESCO. With five
exceptions (Bahamas, Nauru, Singapore, Timor-Lesté, and Tuvalu),55 they are also
members of UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention. Although the number of ac-
tually inscribed World Heritage properties is relatively small, SIDS members of
the convention count 28 items on the World Heritage List (whereas Belize’s Bar-
rier Reef Reserve System56 also features on the list of World Heritage in Danger).
Another illustration of protectable culture is provided by the Convention for
the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (the ICH Convention)57 estab-
lished in 2003, together with the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural
Heritage of Humanity.58 Out of a total of 232 listed items, only six relate to SIDS:
“Language, Dance and Music of the Garifuna” in Belize; “La Tumba Francesa” in
Cuba; “The Cocolo Dance Drama Tradition” and “The Cultural Space of the Broth-
erhood of the Holy Spirit of the Congos of Villa Mella,” both in the Dominican
Republic; “The Maroon Heritage of Moore Town” in Jamaica; “The Lakalaka,
Dances and Sung Speeches of Tonga”; and “Vanuatu Sand Drawing.”59

The Vanuatuan item exemplifies the intangible heritage involved, its vulnera-
bility, and safeguarding efforts. Proclaimed a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intan-
gible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2003,60 Vanuatu’s sand drawings are
artful geometric patterns produced directly on the ground to transmit traditional
knowledge about local history, indigenous rituals, kinship systems, natural phe-

nomena, and farming techniques.61 Sand drawing also represents a means of com-
munication among the members of various language groups in the north of the
Vanuatu archipelago.62 Expert sand drawers possess intimate knowledge of the nu-
merous graphic patterns and a deep understanding of their complex layers of
meaning.63

To help preserve the practice and meaning of Vanuatu sand drawing, Vanuatu’s
National Cultural Council, a representative body of cultural policy, initiated a Na-
tional Action Plan for the Safeguarding of Sand Drawing in 2000.64 Sponsored by
UNESCO and Japan Funds-in-Trust for the Preservation and Promotion of In-
tangible Cultural Heritage, the National Action Plan consisted of two compo-
nents: revitalization, transmission, and promotion; and legal protection, income
generation, and inventory-making.65 One project outcome is the National Sand
Drawing Festival established in 2004.66

A further indicator of vulnerable cultural diversity are the local languages in
SIDS.67 Statistics show SIDS’ rich linguistic heritage. For example, Papua New
Guinea is one of the most linguistically diverse and complex areas in the world,
with close to 850 indigenous languages spoken,68 and at least as many traditional
communities, among a population of about 6 million.69 Among these languages,

UNESCO’s Atlas of the World Languages in Danger identifies at least 98 as vulner-
able, endangered, or even extinct.70 See Figure 2.

Vanuatu, a much smaller country with a population of 240,000, still has 110
languages, 46 of which are considered to be at critical risk.71 Efforts to revitalize
such languages notwithstanding,72 such findings appear to reflect a general trend.
Table 1 lists the aforementioned selected indicators of protectable cultural heri-
tage in SIDS, together with the net migration rate per country.

CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED INSTRUMENTS AND

INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

The Climate Change Regime Focuses on the Utility
of Traditional Knowledge

Historically, traditional knowledge76 has been an important source of local inno-
vation to provide solutions for adjusting to the conditions of nature. In this sense,
the use of traditional knowledge is often discussed in the context of knowledge

dissemination and technology transfer for climate change adaptation. For exam-
ple, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)77 documented the
practical relevance of traditional knowledge in member countries78 for sustain-
able management of dryland ecosystems.79 The UNFCCC, too, acknowledges the
importance of using traditional knowledge in climate change adaptation80 and
aims to promote its dissemination in developing countries. Local knowledge sys-
tems can help communities understand and adapt to change in climate.81

Conversely, given the primary concern with the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, aspects of cultural heri-
tage less utilitarian for the purpose of greenhouse gas reduction, such as tradi-
tional cultural expressions (TCEs) or expressions of folklore, hardly figure in
the ongoing climate change discussion. For instance, the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) projects allow developed countries to invest in
greenhouse gas emission reduction projects in developing countries, and in re-
turn they receive credit for the remission reduction or removal achieved.82
Not surprisingly, there is no current CDM project directly involving the protec-
tion of TCEs or expressions of folklore, or indeed of cultural heritage in a broader
sense.83

The National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA), intended to address the
urgent adaptation needs of Least Developed Countries under the auspices of the
UNFCCC,84 also seems to neglect projects directly related to the protection of cul-
tural heritage. A few SIDS—Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu—have sub-
mitted NAPA projects in relation to their tourism industry,85 but without express
reference to the protection of cultural heritage.

UNESCO’s Risk Management Approach for Climate Change
Adaptation: The ICOMOS Position

The UNESCO World Heritage Centre, in its report on climate change and World
Heritage,86 recognizes climate change as one of a range of factors affecting our
natural and cultural heritage. Set out in the following text is UNESCO’s itemiza-
tion of principal climate change risks and their impact on cultural heritage.87

Noting that conservation of World Heritage is essentially about “the manage-
ment of change” and that the climate is one such area of change, UNESCO recom-
mends a three-part strategy for safeguarding World Heritage against the emerging
climate conditions:89

• Preventive actions: monitoring, reporting and mitigation of climate change
effects through environmentally sound choices and decisions at a range of
levels: individual, community, institutional and corporate.

• Corrective actions: adaptation to the reality of climate change through global

and regional strategies and local management of plans.

CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING CULTURE

269

• Sharing knowledge: including best practices, research, communication, pub-
lic and political support, education and training, capacity building, network-
ing, etc.90

Taking a similar approach, the International Council on Monuments and Sites
(ICOMOS) concludes that

climate change adaptation for cultural heritage should be mainstreamed
into the existing methodologies for preservation and conservation of
sites, buildings, settlements, landscapes, movable objects and the living
traditions and that appropriate standards and protocols should be de-
veloped for the purpose. Equally cultural heritage needs and concerns
should be mainstreamed into institutional processes and policies for
disaster reduction.91

Skeptical about such risk management approaches, some scholars observe that, in
the climate change regime, cultural heritage struggles to compete against an “av-
alanche of other urgent resource-demanding concerns.”92 Part of the problem,
they assert, is the cultural heritage regime itself paying little attention to the “cul-
tural heritage values”93 for mankind. The human and cultural dimension of cli-
mate change implies “the need to consider how the loss of tangible heritage places,
sites and structures will affect communities and the intangible aspects of culture,
or on finding locally appropriate response to this potential loss.”94 Such under-
standing of how climate change jeopardizes entire cultures and ways of life is viewed
as a catalyst for action.95 For example, if adequately motivated,96 indigenous peo-
ple have a key role not only in observing change, but also in developing adaptive
models to cope.97

Emerging Climate Change Refugee Policy Proposals
and Cultural Heritage

Current international refugee law incorporates the principles of nondiscrimina-
tion and national treatment. According to the Convention Relating to the Status
of Refugees (the 1951 Refugee Convention),98 the host country must not discrim-
inate refugees on race, religion, or country of origin.99 Also, the host country is
required to provide treatment “at least as favorable as that accorded to their na-
tionals with respect to freedom to practice their religion and freedom as regards
the religious education of their children.”100

The latter principle of national treatment is also applied to the protection of
industrial property and of rights in literary, artistic, and scientific works. A refu-
gee must be accorded in the country in which he or she has his habitual residence
the same protection as is accorded to the nationals of that country.101 In addition,
the 1951 Refugee Convention provides for “intergenerational transmission and the

non-interference of this transmission,”102 a right of association,103 and freedom
of movement.104

One limitation of national treatment or most-favored nation clauses is that, if
the host country does not offer its nationals adequate protection of cultural iden-
tity or heritage per se, climate change refugees can hardly expect better protection.
Considering that international refugee law does not yet cater to issues specifically
associated with climate change displacement,105 some are advocating the creation
of a treaty covering climate change refugees.106 Proponents of such an agreement
argue that as climate change refugees’ intangible cultural heritage “is no longer
preserved by the laws and institutions of their home state, the legal protection of
[climate change refugees’] cultural autonomy may be regarded as a mechanism of
preservation, . . . and safeguarding intangible cultural heritage can further support
the relocation of entire population and social groups.”107 Further, some argue that
environmental refugees should be given a right to “constitute themselves collec-
tively and maintain their collective identity.”108

LESSONS FROM RIGHTS-BASED PROTECTION OF TRADITIONAL

CULTURAL EXPRESSIONS

A wide range of public considerations underlies ongoing efforts to protect intan-
gible cultural heritage.109 While the 2003 UNESCO Convention does not provide
a separate definition of protection as such,110 the 2005 UNESCO Convention on
the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (the 2005
UNESCO Convention) defines it as “the adoption of measures aimed at the pres-
ervation, safeguarding and enhancement of the diversity of cultural expressions.”111
The 1985 UNESCO-WIPO Model Provisions for National Laws on the Protection
of Expressions of Folklore against Illicit Exploitation and Other Prejudicial Ac-
tions (the 1985 UNESCO-WIPO Model Provisions) states inter alia that “protec-
tion should be against any improper utilization of expressions of folklore [or
traditional cultural expressions], including the general practice of making profit
by commercially exploiting such expressions outside their originating communi-
ties without any recompense to such communities.”112

For practical purposes, protection of intangible cultural heritage needs to focus
on two goals: to prevent “misappropriation” by third parties without prior in-
formed consent; and, especially relevant in the context of climate change, to pre-
vent loss as such.113 Increasingly, it is thought that both of these goals can be served
by according specific rights to holders of intangible cultural heritage and that tai-
lored rights can motivate them to preserve, practice, and promote their tradi-
tional assets even after they leave their homeland. In this regard, this section of
the article briefly describes the soft-law making process for the protection of tra-
ditional cultural expressions at WIPO and other intergovernmental institutions
and situates the climate change dimension in that process.

CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING CULTURE

273

Rights-Based Mechanisms in Some South Pacific Countries

It has been noted that, for South Pacific islanders,

the concept of ownership (either by individuals, families or communi-
ties) of songs, dances and other forms of traditional knowledge and cus-
tom has been well-established for a long period of time . . . and the
knowledge [of such traditional cultural expressions] was a commodity
exchanged between local groups in the past.114

To decide ownership disputes, courts often relied on customary law.115 An exam-
ple is In the Matter of the Nagol Jump, in which case a group of applicants tried to
prevent others from performing the Nagol jump on the island of Santo (the Nagol
jump is a traditional ceremony, similar to bungee jumping, from the island of
Pentecost).116 The Supreme Court of Vanuatu decided the case on “substantial
justice” and “in conformity with custom”, finding that the Nagol jumping should
“return” to its origins in Pentecost.117

In recent years, a growing number of South Pacific countries have been for-
mally integrating the protection of traditional cultural expressions into existing
intellectual property law118 and, additionally, have been developing a sui generis
protection system generally based on the Secretariat of Pacific Community’s 2002
Model Law on Traditional Knowledge and Expression of Culture (“South Pacific
Model Law”).119 Administration and advancement of the South Pacific Model Law
are now in the hands of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat, which has further
established the Traditional Knowledge Implementation Action Plan,120 with the
aim of assisting the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea, and
Vanuatu in their implementation of traditional knowledge and traditional cul-
tural expressions protection. Similar activities address the needs of other SIDS such
as Niue, Samoa, and the Solomon Islands.121

Major Components of Sui Generis Protection

International efforts to provide a sui generis basis for the protection of traditional
cultural expressions have focused primarily on instruments of soft law, such as the
aforementioned 1985 UNESCO-WIPO Model Provisions.122 In 2000 the WIPO
General Assembly created the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellec-
tual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC)
to negotiate appropriate protection mechanisms.123 In 2006 the IGC developed
draft objectives, principles, and substantive provisions for the protection of tradi-
tional cultural expressions/expressions of folklore (IGC Draft).124 While the IGC
work has progressed to a stage of text-based expert meetings,125 regional devel-
opments saw not only the creation of the South Pacific Model Law, but also the
adoption by the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) of
the Swakopmund Protocol on the Protection of Traditional Knowledge and Ex-

274

HEE-EUN KIM

pression of Folklore within the Framework of ARIPO.126 The principal elements
of these instruments may be summarized as follows.
Subject Matter and Scope of Protection

As defined in the IGC Draft, “traditional culture expressions” or “expressions of
folklore” are any forms, whether tangible or intangible, in which traditional cul-
ture and knowledge are expressed, appear or are manifested, and comprise forms
of expressions or combinations that are verbal, musical, by action, or tangible.127
Such expressions should be protected against acts of misappropriation.128

The South Pacific Model Law recognizes concepts of “traditional cultural rights”
and “moral rights” to traditional knowledge or expressions of culture. Moral rights
thereby refer to the right of attribution of ownership,129 the right against derog-
atory treatment,130 and the right to equitable benefits from derivative works with
commercial nature.131

Traditional cultural rights are described as encompassing rights in relation to
cultural expressions to authorize or prevent their reproduction, publication, pub-
lic performance or display, broadcast, translation, adaptation, arrangement, trans-
formation, modification, fixation (such as by making a photograph, film, or sound
recording), making available online, creation of derivative works, making, using,
offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, or use in any other material form.132
Exceptions and Limitations

The IGC Draft foresees exceptions and limitations to these rights for teaching and
learning, noncommercial research or private study, criticism or review, reporting
news or current events, use in the course of legal proceedings, the making of re-
cordings and other reproductions of traditional cultural expressions for purposes
of their inclusion in an archive or inventory for noncommercial cultural heritage
safeguarding purposes, and incidental uses.133 Interestingly, the South Pacific Model
Law limits the teaching exception to “face to face” teaching134 and does not pro-
vide exceptions for the making of recordings for purposes of archiving.135
Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries are the indigenous people and traditional and other cultural com-
munities in whom the custody, care, and safeguarding of the traditional cultural
expressions are entrusted in accordance with their customary law and practice;
and who maintain, use, or develop the traditional cultural expressions as being
characteristic of their cultural and social identity and cultural heritage.136
Term of Protection

The South Pacific Model Law states that traditional cultural rights as well as moral
rights continue in perpetuity, are inalienable, and cannot be waived or trans-
ferred.137 Conversely, the IGC Draft foresees protection as long as traditional cul-
tural expressions remain registered or notified according to any rules on formalities;
and for secret traditional cultural expressions, as long as they remain secret.138

CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING CULTURE

275

Formalities

As a general rule, the protection as such of traditional cultural expressions is not
dependent on any formality.139 However, registration or notification systems may
be envisaged.140

In terms of user procedures, the South Pacific Model Law identifies two contrac-
tual avenues for a prospective user of traditional cultural expression for noncus-
tomary purposes to seek prior informed consent: (1) applying to a ‘Cultural
Authority’ in charge of identifying beneficiaries and acting as a liaison between pro-
spective users and the beneficiaries; or (2) directly dealing with the beneficiaries.141
Sanctions, Remedies and Exercise of Rights

The IGC Draft states that accessible, appropriate, and adequate enforcement and
dispute-resolution mechanisms, border measures, sanctions, and remedies, includ-
ing criminal, civil, and administrative remedies should be available in case of breach
of protected traditional cultural expressions.142 In addition, the South Pacific Model
Law specifically refers to public apology, alternative dispute resolution (ADR), and
customary law options.143
Relationship with Intellectual Property Protection and Other Forms of
Protection

The IGC Draft provides that the envisaged sui generis protection does not re-
place, but is complementary to, protection under intellectual property laws and
programs for the safeguarding, preservation, and promotion of cultural heritage,
and other available legal and nonlegal measures.144 Likewise, the South Pacific
Model Law affirms that traditional cultural rights do not affect any rights exist-
ing under intellectual property law or other national law.145 It may thereby be
noted that while creators of works derived from traditional cultural expressions
benefit from intellectual property protection, under the South Pacific Model Law
such third parties would also be subject to obligations to the original right
holders.146
International and Regional Protection

In dealing with the “technical question of how rights and interests of foreign
holders” in traditional cultural expressions should be recognized in national laws,147
the IGC Draft takes the notion of national treatment148 as a starting point and
proposes to supplement it with mutual recognition, reciprocity or assimila-
tion.149 The South Pacific Model Law refers to enforcement through reciprocal
arrangement.150

Adding the Climate Change Dimension

Building on the principal components of sui generis protection of traditional cul-
tural expressions cited as an example, this final part adds three brief and diverse

276

HEE-EUN KIM

considerations that might usefully figure in negotiation and implementation of
these instruments, with a view to safeguarding intangible cultural heritage in the
face of climate change and climate change displacement.
Cross-Border Protection

The cross-border aspect of climate change displacement lends weight to the in-
ternational dimension of protection of intangible cultural heritage. Acknowledg-
ing such international protection as priority,151 the IGC in its norm-setting process
for traditional cultural expressions explored, inter alia, whether it should seek to
determine at the international level how their misappropriation and use should
be suppressed, and through what kind of legal instruments.152 Taking the existing
international protection of copyright as an example, the Berne Convention pre-
scribes minimum standards of protection that are binding on all member states.
However, with views differing among participants in the IGC process on the de-
sirable degree of protection for traditional knowledge or traditional cultural ex-
pressions, and its relation to the existing international intellectual property rights
system, the IGC Draft eventually opted for “a neutral form so as not to preempt
the policy choices.”153

National treatment is helpful where the host country provides sufficient protec-
tion for the intangible cultural heritage of its nationals. Likewise, reciprocal arrange-
ments, such as those adopted in the South Pacific Model Law, are useful if the host
country and the country of origin share an effective standard of protection of such
rights. The challenge is how to accommodate national self-determination in this re-
gard while ensuring international protection. Further awareness of the cultural im-
pact of climate change migration might stimulate the development of a minimum
standards approach coupled with an international registration system, perhaps some-
what comparable maybe to the system for appellations of origin established by the
Lisbon Agreement.154
More Funding Initiatives

Legal protection alone cannot maintain intangible cultural heritage. Funding is
essential, for example to support education, promotion, recording and archiving.
One of the first initiatives in this direction is the WIPO Voluntary Fund for Ac-
credited Indigenous and Local Communities, launched in 2010.155 One year
earlier, the 2005 UNESCO Convention156 created the International Fund for
Cultural Diversity (IFCD). The purpose of the IFCD is to promote sustainable
development and poverty reduction in developing countries through support
for projects and activities aiming to foster the emergence of a dynamic cul-
tural sector.157 The first batch of funding requests has been received, but only
few came from SIDS and none were related to climate change.158 Here
again, further awareness of the threat that climate change poses to intangible
cultural heritage may improve the financial basis for giving effect to legal
protection.

277

Training, Good Practices, National Policies: It Takes a Village
A 2007 survey of practices and protocols regarding the safeguarding of cultural
heritage and related intellectual property issues revealed a strong interest on the
part of museums, libraries, and archives in South Pacific countries in receiving
training on such issues and developing good practices and guidelines.159

To respond to such needs, WIPO operates the Creative Heritage Project,160 which
aims to offer practical training to local communities, museums, and archives in
developing countries on recording, digitizing, and disseminating their creative cul-
tural expressions as well as on intellectual property issues.161 A pilot program un-
dertaken with a Maasai community and National Museums of Kenya confirmed
the introduction of intellectual property rights management as a useful tool for
promoting the safeguarding and legal protection of intangible heritage.162

Becoming increasingly aware of their cultural interests, some South Pacific coun-
tries are taking the lead in researching the impact of climate change on their cul-
tural heritage. For example, Vanuatu has adopted a cultural research policy163 under
which the Vanuatu National Cultural Council approves research projects consis-
tent with the country’s research priorities, such as language documentation, cul-
tural and historic site documentation, documentation of indigenous histories, and
case studies of contemporary social change. Research projects must substantially
involve indigenous communities, scholars and students,164 and commercial pro-
ceeds of any research products are to be shared between the council and the
researcher.165

CONCLUSION

The impact of climate change on cultural heritage hardly figures in current cli-
mate change policymaking, with its dominant focus on greenhouse gas emissions
and their direct consequences. Likewise, the conventional perspective of cultural
heritage risk management concerns especially the loss of tangible heritage sites
and structures, and to a lesser extent how such loss will affect communities and
the intangible aspects of culture. However, as climate change displacement mate-
rializes, these human dimensions will demand increasing attention.

One perspective on cultural property is as part of “the cultural heritage of all
mankind,”166 whatever the place of origin or present location.167 Another view of
cultural property is as “a national cultural heritage” invoking in nations or com-
munities a special interest to attribute unique character to their cultural objects
and to legitimize demands for retaining cultural property.168

The emergence of international climate change issues in cultural heritage, in-
tangible as well as tangible, could complicate such distinction of interests. Accom-
modation may need to be made for climate change-related regulation, international
human rights law concerning climate change refugees, and intellectual property
rights or sui generis rights relevant to the protection and promotion of traditional

278

knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, especially in terms of cross-border
protection.

8. According to Article 2 of the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Her-

itage, intangible cultural heritage means

the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills—as well as the in-
struments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith—that com-
munities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural
heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to gen-
eration, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their
environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them
with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural di-
versity and human creativity. . . . Intangible cultural heritage is manifested inter
alia in the following domains: (a) oral traditions and expressions, including lan-
guage as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage; (b) performing arts; (c)
social practices, rituals and festive events; (d) knowledge and practices concern-
ing nature and the universe; and (e) traditional craftsmanship.

See the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, art. 2, 17 October 2003,
in force 20 April 2006 2368 U.N.T.S. 1 [hereinafter 2003 UNESCO Convention].

11. According to Article 1(a) of the WIPO Revised Draft Provisions for the Protection of Tradi-
tional Cutltural Expressions/Expressions of Folklore, traditional cultural expressions or expressions of
folklore are any forms, whether tangible and intangible, in which traditional culture and knowledge
are expressed, appear or are manifested, and comprise the following forms of expressions or com-
binations thereof:

CHANGING CLIMATE, CHANGING CULTURE

279

1. verbal expressions, such as stories, epics, legends, poetry, riddles and other narratives; words,

signs, names, and symbols;

2. musical expressions, such as songs and instrumental music;
3. expressions by action, such as dances, plays, ceremonies, rituals and other performances, whether

or not reduced to a material form; and,

4. tangible expressions, such as productions of art, in particular, drawings, designs, paintings (in-
cluding body painting), carvings, sculptures, pottery, terra-cotta, mosaic, woodwork, metal-
ware, jewelry, baskets, needlework, textiles, glassware, carpets, costumes; handicrafts; musical
instruments; and architectural forms; which are:

a. the products of creative intellectual activity, including individual and communal creativity;
b. characteristic of a community’s cultural and social identity and cultural heritage; and
c. maintained, used or developed by such community, or by individuals having the right or
responsibility to do so in accordance with the customary law and practices of that
community.

See WIPO, Revised Draft Provisions, 11. The terms traditional cultural expressions and expressions of
folklore can be used interchangeably. For further discussion about traditional cultural expressions,
see the fourth section of the article.

Cf. The 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expres-
sions defines cultural expressions broadly as “cultural expressions are those expressions that result
from the creativity of individuals, groups and societies, and that have cultural content.” See Con-
vention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, 20 October 2005,
U.N. Doc. CLT-2005/CONVENTION DIVERSITE-CULT REV., art. 4(1) [hereinafter 2005 UNESCO
Convention].

for example, “the overall trend shows that the number of recorded natural disasters has doubled

15. See for example, UNHCR et al., Forced Displacement, 2, which states that “there is no mono-
causal relationship between climate change and displacement. . . . However, . . . there is a clear link
between the effects of climate change and displacement”.

16. IOM et al., Climate Change, Migration, 1, noting, however, the absence of “scientifically ver-
ified estimates of climate change-related displacement or of overall population flows triggered by
the effects of climate change.” See also Kang, Climate Change, Migration and Human Rights, 3–4,
citing the Stern Report on the Economics of Climate Change, 56. See also Docherty and Giannini,
“Confronting a Rising Tide,” 353–54, which states that estimates of the number of climate refugees
vary depending on the definition of the class of the displaced and the source of the data, and that
while some research urges caution in attempting to predict a number, other studies present figures
ranging from 50 million to 200 million displaced persons before 2100.

out that, although some 26.5 million were reported to have been affected by 12 droughts in 2008,

280

HEE-EUN KIM

estimates for displacement are not readily available because of the complexity in determining the
element of force and ascribing causation.

25. See for example, Myers, “Environmental Refugees,” 609–11, stating that

out of the 25 million environmental refuges in 1995 around the world, there
were roughly 5 million in the African Sahel, where a full 10 million had fled
from droughts, only half returning home. . . . In other parts of Sub-Saharan Af-
rica, 7 million people had been obliged to migrate in order to obtain relief food.

26. Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Climate Changed: People Displaced, 5–7.
27. See for example, Annan, Keynote Speech at the Global Conference, 4 November 2010, high-
lighting that “feeding Africa, at a time of climate change, is one of the major development challenges
of our time” and “without concerted action, we will see many more people forced to leave their land,
increased famines, tensions and instability.”

28. Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Climate Changed: People Displaced, 7.
29. IOM, Migration and Climate Change, 25–26, commenting that the world’s media have been
competing to find the “first conclusive ‘victim’ of climate change—who, like a miner’s canary, will
mark the beginning of a period of irreversible climate impacts.”

30. IOM, Migration and Climate Change, 25–26, stating that “in 2005, it was officially decided to
evacuate the 1,000 residents of the Carteret Islands, a group of small and low-lying coral atolls ad-
ministered by Papua New Guinea, to the larger island of Bougainville, 100 kilometers away.”

31. IOM, Migration and Climate Change, 25–26, noting that “about a hundred residents of Lateu,
on the island of Tegua on Vanuatu, were relocated farther inland, following storm-damage, erosion
and salt damage to their original village.”

32. IOM, Migration and Climate Change, 25–26, explaining that “a combination of melting per-
mafrost and sea-shore erosion at a rate of up to 3.3 meters a year have forced the inhabitants to
relocate their village several kilometers to the south.”

33. IOM, Migration and Climate Change, 25–26, stating that

Lohachara island in the Hooghly river delta, once home to 10,000 people, and
which had first started flooding 20 years ago, had finally been entirely sub-
merged. One of a number of vanishing islands in the delta, the loss of the is-
lands and other coastal land in the delta has left thousands of people homeless.

34. Biermann and Boas, “Preparing for a Warmer World,” 60–67, addressing the need of a global
governance system regarding “climate change refugees” or “climate refugees.” These refugees can be
defined as “people who have to leave their habitats, immediately, or in the near future, because of
sudden or gradual alterations in their natural environment related to at least one of three impacts of
climate change: sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and drought and water scarcity.” For further
discussions on “climate change refugees,” see Docherty and Giannini, “Confronting a Rising Tide”;

between lawful migrants and undocumented migrants.”

tourism can distort cultural expressions. The question, however, is if the com-
munity who is the bearer and practitioner of the tradition decides to alter the
tradition for the purpose of making money, is that a distortion? Or maybe is the
intervention of UNESCO, museums and anthropologists saying that they can’t
do that the real distortion?

110. But the 2003 UNESCO Convention defines safeguarding as “measures aimed at ensuring the
viability of the intangible cultural heritage, including the identification, documentation, research,
preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission, particularly through formal and
non-formal education, as well as the revitalization of the various aspects of such heritage.”

ditional ceremony due to growing commercialization.” See Vanuatu Cultural Centre, Moratorium on
Commercial Filming of Nagol.

118. WIPO, Legislative Texts on the Protection, indicates that, for example, Fiji, the Federated States
of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu have incorporated the protection of tradi-
tional cultural expressions in their copyright laws and Palau in its Historical and Cultural Preserva-
tion Act of 1995. However, opinion is divided as to whether the intellectual property system offers

284

optimal protection of traditional cultural expressions. See Marra, “IP & Traditional Cultural,” who
describes how, during a side event of the 17th Session of WIPO IGC on 8 December 2010, some
indigenous communities expressed reluctance to accept copyright protection of their traditional cul-
tural expressions because copyright affords only temporary protection, instead of the perpetual pro-
tection to which they feel their culture is entitled.

119. Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Regional Framework for the Protection (herein-

after, “South Pacific Model Law”).

120. Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), Traditional Knowledge, provides that the Action Plan
consists of two components: first, to develop a national system of protection setting out new rights
and obligations in traditional knowledge that will complement existing forms of protection for in-
tellectual property; second, to develop cultural industries to promote the commercialization of tra-
ditional knowledge.
