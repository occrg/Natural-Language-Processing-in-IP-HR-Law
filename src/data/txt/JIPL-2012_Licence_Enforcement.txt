Legally enforceable contract
The licensor will only have the option to sue under
breach of contract if the licence is a legally binding and
enforceable contract at law between the licensor and
the licensee. While this may appear trite, licence agree-
ments may suffer from ﬂaws that render them unsuit-
able as contractual agreements. Consequently, as a ﬁrst
step, the licence should be reviewed to ensure it meets
the requirements for an enforceable contract under the
applicable jurisdiction. Particular care should be paid
to the issue of party identity.

Complications can also arise from a failure of
consideration where IP was jointly developed, where
assignments from inventors are lacking or ﬂawed, or
where corporate reorganization has occurred without
the appropriate transfer of
to successor
companies.

IP rights

Further complications arise where the licensor is an
IP holding company, and not the party directly suffer-
ing harm from the alleged breach. In some jurisdic-
tions, such as England and Wales,1 these concerns can
be addressed through pre-emptive drafting. However,
in other jurisdictions, harm to a party who is not part
of the licence agreement may not be fully recoverable.

Other licences may need to be considered as well.
The licensor should consider whether it is contractually
obliged to pursue an infringement claim through an
obligation to other licensees, or can in turn seek assist-
ance from a party whom it acquired part of
the
licensed IP from.

Termination of the licence
A licensor may be bound to continue to honour its
obligations under
the licence agreement despite a
breach by the licensee (and thus signiﬁcantly be pro-
hibited from initiating an infringement action) if the
breach does not reach a level sufﬁcient to allow termin-
ation (or possibly rescission) of the contract, or if the
licensor fail to terminate the contract. If rescission is
available, care should be taken to determine whether

word or deed,2 in which case initiating an infringement

rescind the agreement; however, it may be desirable to
plead termination or rescission of any previous licence

agreement preemptively if it is likely to be raised as a
defence.

Termination will not be possible in some jurisdic-
tions if the breach of the licence does not go to the
core of the agreement; that is to say, if it is a nominal
breach rather than a material or fundamental breach.
Again the licensor may be restricted to pursuing only
the breach of the contract, as the defendant will have
the option of
the nominal breach and
continuing to beneﬁt from the licence as a defence to
an infringement claim.

curing

The existence of a right

to terminate will often
depend on how the licence agreement was structured.
Broadly speaking,
the consideration provided by a
licensee in exchange for the licence can be provided
upfront, continuously (such as a cross licence), or in
the future upon reaching agreed milestones (volume of
sales, passage of time, per unit).

Where the consideration has been provided up-
front, future breaches may only be resolvable under a
contract approach, ‘but when a breaching party “has
substantially performed” before breaching, the other
party’s performance is not excused’.3 Consequently, the
licence would provide a valid defence to the licensee to
any infringement claim.

Whether there is substantial performance is a ques-
tion that will need to be carefully assessed under the
laws of
the applicable jurisdiction for each licence
agreement.

including the ratio of

There is no simple test for determining whether substantial
performance has been rendered and several factors must
be considered,
the performance
already rendered to that unperformed, the quantitative
character of the default, the degree to which the purpose
behind the contract has been frustrated, the willfulness of
the default, and the extent to which the aggrieved party
has already received the substantial beneﬁt of the promised
performance.4

The issue of whether a party has substantially performed is
usually a question of fact and should be decided as a
matter of law only where the inferences are certain.5

Enforcing an infringement claim will also be difﬁcult if
the

continuing basis, even where the breach involves

Under
the
licensor will generally not be able to rescind the
contract where there is no possibility of restoring the
parties to their pre-contractual position (so as to avoid
unjustly enriching the licensor).6

restitutio in integrum,

Even a breach which may have signiﬁcant conse-
quences to the licensor may not sufﬁce to allow rescis-
sion. In Columbia Gas System, Inc.,7 EnerSys had a
contractual obligation to observe a use restriction pro-
hibiting use of the trade mark outside of the licensed
industrial battery business. However, the court held
that this was not a material obligation, which would
allow rescission, as it was a condition subsequent to
EnerSys’s use of the mark in accordance with the terms
of the trade mark licence. The court held that a condi-
tion subsequent
is not a material obligation ‘non-
occurrence of a condition is not a breach by a party
unless he is under a duty that the condition occur’.8

Jurisdiction
Assuming that the licensor is able to terminate the
contract, it will have the option of pursuing either a
contractual claim or a proprietary claim based on
infringement of the formerly licensed IP right. The
forums available for the respective action(s) should
feature prominently in the licensor’s strategy.

Many licence agreements will contain jurisdictional,
choice of
law, or remedy clauses (arbitration, etc)
restricting or prescribing the manner in which the
licensor can enforce a contractual breach. Generally,
these provisions will be enforceable in the event of a
breach with regard to any contractual disputes.
However, most licence agreements are silent, or unen-
forceable, with regard to the issue of
infringement
actions following breach of the licensing arrangement.
Consequently, an infringement
suit can often be
launched in whichever jurisdictions the IP is infringed
in, regardless of a potentially licensee favourable forum
or resolution clauses in the licence agreement.
In
particular where there is infringement of a statutorily
granted IP right occurring in a separate country from
that outlined in the jurisdictional clause,
it will be
unlikely that the courts of the country in which the
infringement is taking place will decline jurisdiction

over the infringement dispute. Further, as IP rights are
assignable, they might be transferred and subsequently
by a non-contracting third party.

Even within a single country, the contractual and
proprietary issues arising from the breach of a licence
might optionally or necessarily be
addressed by
separate courts. For example, in Canada, most private
contractual matters will fall within Provincial jurisdic-
tion, while the Federal Court has a more expansive
jurisdiction with respect to most IP rights.

Where the option to ﬁle in multiple jurisdictions
arises, care should be taken in choosing the appropriate
forum(s). Should the licensor ﬁle an action in only one
forum, the licensee may seek to ﬁle a claim in the other
seeking a declaration of non-infringement, revocation of
the IP right, or a declaration that the licence agreement
remains valid. Such actions can complicate the licensor’s
enforcement efforts signiﬁcantly, particularly where the
issues determined by the separate actions are overlapping.

Costs and timing
Cost will also be an important factor to consider in
making the choice of
jurisdiction. Naturally, should
two separate suits be initiated the costs to both parties
will increase. Generally, enforcement of a contractual
right will be cheaper than enforcement of a proprietary
IP right, as only a breach will need to be established;
while to establish infringement expert evidence may be
needed, and it may also be necessary to establish a
breach of the licence agreement, should it be raised as a
defence to the infringement claim.

In some situations, an aggressive response to the
initial breach of a licence agreement may be cost-
effective in the long run. By seeking both infringement
and breach of licence remedies, the licensee may be
more willing to enter into a settlement agreement, and
other parties may be more hesitant to infringe the
licensor’s IP rights in the future.

Timing will also play an important role in the licen-
sor’s choice. An infringement claim may be an attractive
option where there is the possibility of an interim
injunction. Where no interim relief
available,
pursuing the avenue most likely to result in an early
trial, or amenable to summary trial, may be desirable.
This will usually be the contractual claim as infringe-
ment claims are more likely to require discovery and
expert evidence.

Remedies
The remedy a licensor is likely to obtain under a contract
theory will generally be a monetary sum designed to
compensate the licensor for the harm caused by the licen-
see’s breach. A declaration that there was a breach may
also be granted, but is unlikely to be of signiﬁcant value.
An injunction or prohibition against further breaches is
unlikely unless both parties wish the licence to continue
(having disputed a portion of the licence, but without
having terminated or repudiated the agreement).

Contract-based damage may also be able to compen-
sate for indirect harm occurring as a result of the
breach, such as consequential difﬁculties with other
actual or potential licensees (but the evidence to estab-
lish this may be hard to obtain).

In contrast, those pursuing their proprietary rights will
generally be seeking an injunction prohibiting further
infringement, or at least a declaration of infringement
which can be used to assist proving future acts of
infringement if the infringement persists. Damages can
be granted for the infringement but, as there will usually
have been only limited acts of infringement between the
termination of the licence and the initiation of the
lawsuit, these damages may not be signiﬁcant.

Punitive damages will usually not apply for breach
of a contract but may be obtainable under a propri-
etary claim, as, having taken a licence, the licensee will
have knowledge of actual or potential
infringement
should they breach the agreement. The amount of any
punitive damages, if any, will vary greatly by jurisdic-
tion and on the speciﬁc evidence of each case.

Two particular beneﬁcial remedies provided through a
proprietary claim, but generally unavailable in contractual
actions, are an award of unjust enrichment and (in some
jurisdictions) statutory damages. In a ﬁeld where licence
royalty rates are low, and or proﬁt margins are high, an
award of the infringer’s proﬁts under a proprietary claim
can be signiﬁcantly higher than a claim for damages by
the licensor (under either a proprietary or contractual
theory). Similarly, where statutory damages are available,
the amount awarded for commercial
infringement of
multiple copyright protected works can greatly exceed
any actual damages faced by the rights holder.9

Potential adverse consequences
In deciding the approach to take to a breach of the
licence agreement, the licensor should also consider the

US Dist LEXIS 68642 the copyright holders were awarded 22,500 US
dollars per song for a total of 625,000 while actual damages were likely to
be nominal as each song was being sold for 99 cents. The amount was

potential impact of both favourable and unfavourable
rulings on their relationship with third parties.

A proprietary claim is more likely to put the under-
lying IP asset at risk of
invalidation than pursuing
contractual remedies. This will generally be a negative
in terms of both costs and potential harm to other
licence agreements or activities. However, in some cir-
cumstances, it may be worth pursuing an infringement
action to ‘test’
the IP right, particularly against a
poorly prepared infringer. If the IP survives the chal-
lenge, the licensor may go on to achieve greater success
against other potential licensees.

Similarly, should the licensor pursue a contractual
claim, the asserted terms of the licence agreement will be
put before judicial scrutiny. Should there be other licen-
sees with similar terms, the possible consequences of
setting an unfavourable precedent needs to be considered.

First steps
As a ﬁrst step in considering legal action in response to
a breach of a licence agreement, the licensor should

carefully examine the current licence and any other
licence agreements and the nature of the breach. This
review will determine if termination or rescission of
the agreement is an option, or if the licensor must
pursue contractual remedies alone. The review should
also determine whether there are jurisdictional or reso-
lution terms from the licence agreement which may be
applicable.

If

the licence can be terminated,

the option to
pursue a proprietary-based infringement claim presents
itself. This approach will generally be more expensive
and take longer than a contractual approach, but may
offer
in terms of ﬂexible
remedies and the possibility of an injunction to prevent
future acts of infringement by the former licensee.

In some cases, it will be advisable to pursue both
