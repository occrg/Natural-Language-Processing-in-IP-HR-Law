The shape of the Lego brick is free for all to use
Patricia Cappuyns*

The famous Lego construction brick is a shape with a
technical function. It enjoyed patent protection under
the original ‘Kiddicraft’ patents and additional protec-
tion under the amended patents ﬁled by Lego. Ever
since its patents expired, Lego has sought to carve out
the shape of the Lego brick from the public domain
and reclaim its monopoly by asserting other types of IP
rights,
including copyrights, design rights, and most
recently trade marks.

In light of the public interests underlying the func-
tionality exclusion in Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of the Commu-
nity Trade Mark Regulation (CTMR),1 the Ofﬁce for
the Harmonisation of the Internal Market (OHIM) has
not allowed Lego’s attempt to re-monopolize its for-
merly patented technical invention under the guise of
trade mark law. Both the Cancellation Division and the
Grand Board of Appeal held that the registration of the
3D trade mark awarded by the Examiner should be
cancelled in application of the functionality exclusion.
This cancellation has now been conﬁrmed by the Euro-
pean Court of First Instance (CFI) in a judgment of 12
November 2008.

In this article, I explain the factual background of
Lego v OHIM – MEGA Brands and its procedural
history, the functionality exclusion and its application
by the European Court of Justice in Philips v Reming-
ton, with particular attention to the policy interests
underlying this exclusion and ﬁnally the CFI’s appli-
cation of the teachings of Philips v Remington in its
judgment of 12 November 2008.

The construction brick, the Page/Lego
patents, and the CTM under review
On 1 April 1996, Lego ﬁled Community trade mark
No. 107 029 for various goods in class 9, as well as for
‘games and playthings; gymnastic and sporting articles
(included in class 28); decorations for Christmas trees’

Page was granted several patents in the UK and else-
where, including France and Canada. The ﬁgures in
UK patent No. 587,206 show that the invention is
characterized by the presence of cylindrical connecting
knobs on the upper side of the block, usually referred
to as ‘primary projections’.

power’, and additional possibilities to combine the
bricks.

It is noteworthy that the only shape described, illus-
trated, and claimed in Lego’s patent for the primary
projections (connecting knobs) is cylindrical. In con-
trast, various alternative shapes were disclosed for the
secondary projections:

The shape of the CTM at issue is essentially identical
to the shape of Mr Page’s brick shown in Fig. 1 of UK
Patent No. 587,206.

When identifying the preferred embodiment of the
improved building blocks, Lego speciﬁcally stated that
‘in a preferred embodiment, both the primary and the
secondary projections are of cylindrical shape . . . ’.2

By the early 1990s, the pioneering Page patents and
Lego’s improvement patents had all expired. Conse-
quently, the technical features described and claimed in
these expired patents should be freely available for use
by anyone who wishes to compete in the market for
construction toys.

However, following the expiry of its patents Lego
sought to carve out the shape of the LEGO brick from
the public domain and reclaim its monopoly by assert-

If granted, this CTM would allow Lego to prevent com-
petitors from using the best, most functional shape
available for toy construction bricks described in those
patents, thereby severely limiting if not excluding all
effective competition and enjoying a monopoly that
would potentially be perpetual.

Procedural history of LegovOHIM–
MEGABrands
Although the CTM was initially granted, in a decision
of 30 July 2004, it was declared invalid by the OHIM
Cancellation Division for ‘construction toys’ in class 28
on the basis of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) CTMR.3 In its ﬁrst
ever decision, the OHIM Grand Board rejected Lego’s
appeal and conﬁrmed the cancellation of the regis-
tration on 10 July 2006.4 On 12 November 2008, the
European CFI dismissed Lego’s appeal against
the
decision of the OHIM Grand Board and again con-
ﬁrmed the cancellation of the registration.5 An appeal
is still pending before the European Court of Justice.

Council of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Members
States relating to trade marks was Art 3(1)(e) second indent. It is now

solutions or

The rationale of the grounds for refusal of registration laid
down in Article 3(1)(e) of the Directive is to prevent trade
mark protection from granting its proprietor a monopoly
on technical
functional characteristics of a
product which a user is likely to seek in the products of
competitors. Article 3(1)(e) is thus intended to prevent the
protection conferred by the trade mark right from being
extended, beyond signs which serve to distinguish a
product or service from those offered by competitors, so as
to form an obstacle preventing competitors from freely
offering for sale products incorporating such technical
solutions or functional characteristics in competition with
the proprietor of the trade mark.8

Individuals should not be allowed to acquire or per-
petuate exclusive trade mark rights relating to technical
solutions, and competitors should not be limited by
such exclusive trade mark rights in their freedom of
choice between shapes whose essential characteristics
perform a technical function.

As regards, in particular, signs consisting exclusively of the
shape of the product necessary to obtain a technical result,
listed in Article 3(1)(e), second indent, of the Directive,
that provision is intended to preclude the registration of
shapes whose essential characteristics perform a technical
function, with the result that the exclusivity inherent in
the trade mark right would limit the possibility of competi-
tors supplying a product incorporating such a function or at
least limit their freedom of choice in regard to the technical
solution they wish to adopt in order to incorporate such a
function in their product.
As Article 3(1)(e) of

the Directive pursues an aim
which is in the public interest, namely that a shape whose
essential characteristics perform a technical
function and
were chosen to fulﬁl that function may be freely used by all,
that provision prevents such signs and indications from
being reserved to one undertaking alone because they have
been registered as trade marks (see, to that effect, Wind-
surﬁng Chiemsee, paragraph 25).9

The fact that other shapes exist which could achieve
the same technical result cannot overcome the ground
for invalidity contained in Article 3(1)(e)(ii) of the
Directive. The existence of other shapes is irrelevant to
the question of whether the shape under consideration
is necessary to obtain a technical result:

the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (hereafter the

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2009, Vol. 4, No. 7

As to the question whether the establishment that there are
other shapes which could achieve the same technical result
can overcome the ground for refusal or invalidity con-
tained in Article 3(1)(e), second indent, there is nothing in
the wording of that provision to allow such a conclusion.

In refusing registration of such signs, Article 3(1)(e),
second indent, of the Directive reﬂects the legitimate aim
of not allowing individuals to use registration of a mark in
order to acquire or perpetuate exclusive rights relating to
technical solutions.

Where the essential

functional characteristics of

the
shape of a product are attributable solely to the technical
result, Article 3(1)(e), second indent, precludes registration
of a sign consisting of that shape, even if that technical
result can be achieved by other shapes.10

The ECJ concluded:

In the light of those considerations, the answer to the
fourth question must be that Article 3(1)(e),
second
indent, of the Directive must be interpreted to mean that a
sign consisting exclusively of the shape of a product is
unregistrable by virtue thereof if it is established that the
essential functional features of that shape are attributable
only to the technical result. Moreover,
the ground for
refusal or invalidity of registration imposed by that pro-
vision cannot be overcome by establishing that there are
other shapes which allow the same technical result to be
obtained.11

Consequently, under Article 7(1)(e)(ii) CTMR a sign
will be excluded from registration when:

1. the sign consists exclusively of the shape of the

product, and

2. the shape of the product is necessary to obtain a
technical result, or to use the terms used by the ECJ,
when the essential functional features of that shape
are attributable only to the technical result.

The ECJ’s judgment in Philips v Remington prompted
trade mark ofﬁces in some Member States to change
their evaluation of
functional shapes. For example,
before Philips v Remington, the German Patent and
Trade Mark Ofﬁce allowed trade mark registration for
primarily functional product
conﬁguration marks,
where it was satisﬁed that alternative shapes could
perform the same function. Following the ECJ’s judg-
ment in Philips v Remington, however, the German

10 Philips v Remington, paragraphs 81 – 83, emphasis added.
11 Philips v Remington, paragraph 84, emphasis added.
12 A similar policy underlies the ‘substantial value’ exclusion in Art

7(1)(e)(iii) CTMR, which excludes from trade mark protection signs
which consist exclusively of the shape which gives substantial value to the
goods. Here, the balance to be struck is between trade mark and
copyright/design protection. The rationale of Art 7(1)(e)(iii) is to avoid

Patent and Trade Mark Ofﬁce abandoned this approach
and, in a decision of 2 February 2005, cancelled the
German equivalent of Lego’s three-dimensional trade
mark.

Policy interests underlying the
functionality exclusion and Philipsv
Remington
Under Philips v Remington, the rationale of Article
7(1)(e)(ii) CTMR is to disallow the creation of any
monopoly in ‘shapes whose essential characteristics
perform a technical function’. This absolute ground of
refusal is intended to prevent a trade mark from being
extended beyond its lawful role of origin indicator to
an unlawful obstacle preventing competitors
from
freely offering for sale the same shape that fulﬁls a
technical function.

To avoid the exclusion of Article 7(1)(e)(ii), it is not
sufﬁcient for competitors to have access to one shape
that fulﬁls the intended technical function. Competi-
tors must have access to every shape the essential
characteristics of which fulﬁl a technical function; in
other words, they must be free to choose whatever
shape they want. Therefore, once it is determined that
the essential features of the shape are attributable only
to a technical result, the existence of other shapes to
achieve an identical technical result will not help over-
come the functionality exclusion.

is

A second, related policy interest underlying Article
7(1)(e)(ii)
the desire to safeguard the balance
between trade marks and patents. The duration of
patent protection is by deﬁnition limited in time. It is a
basic tenet of patent law that, when a patent is granted,
the patentee receives temporary exclusive rights to
make the claimed invention.
In return, he must
provide a complete description of the invention and
give to the public sufﬁcient information to allow it to
practice the invention. Once the patent expires, the
public is free to make use of the invention described in
the patent.12

The same is not true for trade mark rights, which
protect not technical but commercial assets. There is
no policy reason to limit the duration of the trade
mark protection as long as the trade mark is used by

that design and copyright protection for shapes which give substantial
value to the goods, having been limited in time, could be bypassed by
trade mark law. For a recent application, see the decision of the OHIM
First Board of Appeal of 10 September 2008 in Case R 497/2005-1
concerning the Bang & Olufsen loudspeaker (after the original decision of
the First Board was annulled by the CFI).

its owner and remains distinctive for the goods or
services claimed.

This balance is upset when a potentially indeﬁnite
protection under the trade mark system is awarded to
essentially functional or technical shapes. Such shapes
should become part of the public domain no later than
20 years after the ﬁrst patent application was ﬁled, or
earlier, if no patent application was ﬁled or if it was
allowed to lapse. The functional know-how that should
have fallen in the public domain after expiry of the
patent could become an exclusive and potentially inde-
ﬁnite monopoly if a trade mark registration is obtained
by the former patentee.

In his opinion in Philips v Remington, the Advocate-
General clearly stated that
the purpose of Article
3(1)(e)(ii) of the Directive is to ensure that the dur-
ation of
IP protection on patents and designs is
limited:

The immediate purpose in barring registration of merely
functional shapes or shapes which give substantial value to
the goods is to prevent the exclusive and permanent right
which a trade mark confers from serving to extend the life
of other rights which the legislature has sought to make
subject to limited periods. I refer, speciﬁcally, to the legis-
lation on industrial patents and designs.

Were it not for the existence of subparagraph (e) of
Article 3(1), it would be easy to overturn the balance of
public interest which must exist between rewarding inno-
vation fairly, by granting
and
encouraging industrial development, which entails placing
time-limits on such protection, with the purpose of
making the goods or the design freely available once the
time-limit expires.13

exclusive protection,

The CFI’s functionality analysis
In a well-reasoned application of the Philips v Reming-
ton doctrine, the CFI clariﬁed a number of issues raised
by the functionality exclusion and dismissed Lego’s
often strained interpretation of the ECJ judgment.

Does the shape have to be entirely functional
to be excluded from trade mark protection?
The ECJ held in Philips v Remington that not all of the
features of the shape must perform a technical function

in order for the exclusion under Article 7(1)(e)(ii)
CTMR to apply. When viewed as a whole, only those
features that are ‘essential’ must be functional.

In his opinion in Philips v Remington, the Advocate-
General had already stated that the addition of a minor
feature that is arbitrary cannot save the shape from the
functionality exclusion.

Use of the phrase ‘essential features’ means that a shape
containing an arbitrary element which, from a functional
point of view, is minor, such as its colour, does not escape
the prohibition.14

The approach followed by both the ECJ and the Advo-
cate-General is entirely consistent with the classic prin-
ciple of trade mark law that the mark under scrutiny
must not be ‘dissected’ but instead must always be ana-
lysed as a whole, with particular attention to those fea-
tures of the mark that are ‘dominant’ or ‘distinctive’.
All examinations under trade mark law concern the
sign as a whole, whereby some features are given
greater weight than others. This is repeatedly conﬁrmed
in established CFI case law regarding absolute and rela-
tive grounds of refusal.15

It follows that words such as ‘exclusively’ or ‘solely’
should not be given an over-literal or rigid interpret-
ation. As the Chancery Division (England and Wales)
neatly put it in after Philips v Remington: ‘ . . . I would
therefore be wary of interpreting each word of [the
ECJ’s Philips v Remington judgment] as if it were a
piece of sacred text’.16

The CFI conﬁrmed that, under the Philips v Reming-
ton judgment, the functionality of the shape must be
assessed by reference to its essential characteristics only.

It is apparent from [the expression ‘essential character-
istics which perform a technical
the
addition of non-essential characteristics having no tech-
nical
function does not prevent a shape from being
caught by that absolute ground of refusal if all the essen-
tial characteristics of that shape perform such a function.
Accordingly,

analyse the functionality of the shape at issue by refer-
ence to the characteristics which it considered to be

Who decides what is essential and functional?
Before the CFI, Lego argued that the essential features
of the shape should be determined from the point of
view of the consumer. If correct, this would make
‘essential’ synonymous with ‘distinctive’. However, the
elements that are distinctive from the consumer’s point
of view do not necessarily coincide with those that are
‘essential’ in the context of a functionality analysis. The
reason is simple: the average consumer does not always
know which technical functions, if any, are performed
by the various features of the shape.

The functionality of the essential features of a shape
should be determined by assessing the shape as a
whole, whereby particular attention should be given to
the technical (‘man of the art’) evidence ﬁled by the
parties so as to allow the Court to understand fully the
role of each of the features of the shape under examin-
ation. If, based on the evidence on ﬁle and with par-
ticular regard for the technical evidence, the Court
ﬁnds that the shape is essentially functional, it should
refuse registration under Article 7(1)(e)(ii).

The CFI conﬁrmed in Lego v OHIM– MEGA Brands
that it should not be left to the consumer to determine
what are the essential characteristics of a shape in the
context of a functionality analysis.

The perception of the target consumer is not relevant to
the analysis of the functionality of the essential character-
istics of a shape. The target consumer may not have the
technical knowledge necessary to assess
the essential
characteristics of a shape and therefore certain character-
istics may be essential from his point of view even though
they are not essential in the context of an analysis of func-
tionality and vice versa. Accordingly, it must be held that
the essential characteristics of a shape must be determined
objectively for the purposes of applying Article 7(1)(e)(ii)
of Regulation No 40/94, on the basis of its graphic rep-
resentation and any descriptions ﬁled at the time of the
application for the trade mark.18

What is the relevance of alternative shapes?
Paragraph 83 of Philips v Remington states unequivo-
cally that Article 7(1)(e)(ii) excludes from trade mark
protection those shapes whose essential characteristics
are attributable solely to the technical result, even if
that technical result can be achieved by other shapes.
This
fully consistent with the policy interest
underlying Article 7(1)(e)(ii), which is not just to give

is

competitors access to a shape that performs the technical
function but rather to safeguard their freedom to
choose any shape for this purpose.19

Therefore, the correct meaning of ‘necessary’ in this
context is that the shape with its essential features suf-
ﬁces to achieve the technical result, in which case trade
mark protection is excluded. As soon as that has been
established, the fact that the same technical result can
also be achieved by other shapes is irrelevant and
cannot overcome the functionality exclusion.

This was conﬁrmed by the CFI in Lego v OHIM–

MEGA Brands.

. . . it follows from paragraphs 81 and 83 of [Philips v
Remington] that the expression ‘necessary to obtain a tech-
nical result’ . . . does not mean that that absolute ground
for refusal applies only if the shape at issue is the only one
which could achieve the intended result. . . . It follows that
the Grand Board of Appeal did not err in considering that
the term ‘necessary’ means that the shape is required to
obtain a technical result, even if that result can be achieved
by other shapes.20

In other words, it is not sufﬁcient that a shape is avail-
able that performs a technical
function. Rather, all
shapes that perform such a technical function must, in
the absence of patent protection, be free for all to use.

Can a functional shape acquire distinctiveness?
Under Article 7(3) CTMR, acquired distinctiveness can
only save trade marks barred under Article 7(1)(b), (c),
and (d) CTMR, but not those barred under (e). This
was conﬁrmed by the ECJ in Philips v Remington (para-
graph 75).21

Under the terms of Articles 7(1)(e)(ii) and 7(3)
CTMR, the functionality of a feature is an objective
quality, unrelated to any perception or recognition by
the consumer of the same feature as being distinctive.
In contrast, acquired distinctiveness is a subjective
quality that has its rightful place in an analysis of the
registrability of not
(Article
7(1)(b)), descriptive (Article 7(1)(c)), and generic
(Article 7(1)(d)) marks. Acquired distinctiveness does
not enter into the discussion regarding any other absol-
ute bars
functionality
(Article 7(3)).

by the OHIM First Board of Appeal in the above-referenced decision

and 19).

Patricia Cappuyns . The shape of the Lego brick is free for all to use

ARTICLE

505

What is the relevance of disclosure of the
shape in expired patents?
Shapes identical or similar to the Lego brick had been
disclosed in numerous expired patents, including the
Page patents and Lego’s improvement patents. The
OHIM Grand Board stressed, and the CFI conﬁrmed,
that patent disclosure by itself is not a bar to the shape
being registered as a trade mark. However, in the cir-
cumstances of this case, these particular expired patents
were key facts in the functionality analysis, and the
OHIM Grand Board qualiﬁed them in concreto as
‘practically irrefutable evidence that the features therein
disclosed or claimed are functional’.22

This holding, which is fully consistent with those of
courts in other jurisdictions,23 is hardly surprising,
since patents will necessarily relate to technical or func-
tional features. The fact that a shape is disclosed and
claimed in one or more expired patents is therefore
strong evidence that the given shape achieves a techni-
cal result.

The CFI found that the OHIM Grand Board did not
base its ﬁnding of functionality on the disclosure of the
various features of the shape in prior patents, and that
it referred to such disclosure only as corroborating evi-
dence for its ﬁnding of functionality.24 The question
whether evidence of prior disclosure in a patent was

irrefutable evidence of the functionality of the shape
was therefore deemed irrelevant.

Delicate balance
The rules regarding the availability of trade mark pro-
tection reﬂect a delicate balance between the protection
of
the freedom to compete and the protection of
immaterial assets, such as goodwill. An object can in
principle be the object of different kinds of overlapping
IP rights. However, the rationale behind the absolute
grounds of refusal in Articles 7 (1)(e)(ii) and (iii) is to
ensure that the trade mark regime, which offers exclu-
sive rights of a potentially unlimited duration, is not
abused to perpetuate a monopoly on a product shape
that formerly was protected by IP rights of a limited
duration.

This is the lesson Lego has learned from the CFI
judgment of 12 November 2008. Lego’s appeal before
the ECJ will result in a judgment at par with Philips v
Remington in which the Court will have the opportu-
nity to further clarify its doctrine concerning the func-
tionality exclusion.

paragraphs 39 –42.

23 The German Bundesgerichtshof held in Philips v Remington, 17

November 2005, that patent(s) granted for the shape of the product for
which a trade mark is claimed are a strong indication that the shape is
exclusively dictated by function, even if the patent(s) have in the mean

time expired (paragraph 8). The US Supreme Court held in TrafFix that
‘a utility patent is strong evidence that the features therein claimed are
functional’ (Annex 1 to TrafFix Devices, Inc. v Marketing Displays, Inc.,
532 US 23 (2001)). The same is true for Canada (Thomas & Betts, Ltd v
Panduit Corp. et al. 4 CPR (4th) 498).
