Contemporary practices and conﬂicts of cultural heritage preservation reﬂect
shifting conceptions of what heritage is and what it should conserve. As such,
the traditional notion of grafﬁti upon national monuments is currently being
called into question, and within the context of this debate, this study argues that
the emerging framework of intangible heritage is a useful model for reconsider-
ing grafﬁti at heritage sites. Arguments for such grafﬁti as intangible heritage are
particularly strong when it can be shown to function as a societal mirror that
reﬂects political climates and protest activities. Such grafﬁti poses tensions
between traditional theories and practices of heritage preservation, in which these
markings are seen to interrupt conservation, and emerging inclusive models such
that view these works as relevant layers of a site’s history. Within this context,
we explore the case of the political grafﬁti on the north wall of a historical
monument, the Iglesia de San Francisco in Santiago, Chile, through the lens of
the emerging ﬁeld of intangible heritage.

Introduction
This article treats the tensions posed by grafﬁti vandalism on heritage sites and
examines shifting views of grafﬁti as cultural expressions through the emerging
framework of intangible heritage. This study challenges current heritage practices
and conceptions by questioning the biases of the ﬁeld, which traditionally hold graf-
ﬁti on monuments to be acts of desecration which disrupt heritagisation processes.
To this end, we review traditional and revised notions of heritage and grafﬁti and
then question whether political grafﬁti, as communal expressions of protest, can be
understood within the scope of intangible heritage. We then continue by presenting
a case study of the political grafﬁti imposed upon a functioning church and histori-
cal monument, the Iglesia de San Francisco in Santiago, Chile. This example illus-
trates the challenges that are involved in assessing grafﬁti on monuments as a form
of heritage, particularly for cases in which such markings are seen to be in conﬂict
with traditional heritage preservation.

Concepts and deﬁnitions
Current heritage scholarship is revising past conceptions and practices which have
framed the work of preserving the past for future generations in restrictive ways
(Ahmad 2006; Smith 2006; Silverman and Fairchild Ruggles 2007; Fairclough et al.
2008; Smith and Akagawa 2009; Labadi and Long 2010). The traditional Western
account of both heritage preservation and its twin, the tourism industry, emphasises
those material works which can be mapped, toured and their relevance quickly
summarised and digested. Yet such practices of objectiﬁcation and materialisation
have had the effect of separating monuments from the communities and individuals
who constructed them and interact with them and the values that such actors have
lent these sites (Byrne 2008, 158).

Together with the emphasis upon materiality, a focal characteristic of traditional
heritage is its aim to maintain a site’s ‘authenticity’, that is, its state as an unchang-
ing representation of some preserved past. The notion that a monument embodies a
speciﬁc era or moment directly reﬂects the idea of heritage as ‘frozen in time’, par-
ticularly in terms of its material, workmanship, design and setting (Labadi 2010,
74). The perceived continuity of these physical elements is understood to conﬁrm
the value and merit of a heritage site.

Finally, it has been said that World Heritage, in its traditional sense, ‘is foremost
a list’ of privileged places that are chosen and authorised by capable practitioners
(Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 2004, 57; Smith 2006, 11). Placement upon the ‘magic list’
of UNESCO World Heritage is a desired status symbol understood to be conferred
upon sites of elevated historical value (Askew 2010). Hence the traditional work of
shaping heritage can be seen to involve the selection and inventorying by a panel of
experts of those sites deemed to best represent particular idealised or imagined pasts,
a process which inevitably privileges some materials and excludes others (Bendix
2009, 254).

The emerging ﬁeld of intangible heritage stands in juxtaposition to the previ-
ously outlined traditional concepts of heritage to reveal biases and gaps in current
preservation conceptions and practices. Foremost, intangible heritage is a break from
past methodologies in its treatment of non-material and time-based cultural events,
including performances and protests, which are difﬁcult to ﬁx in time or to place on
a list (Smith and Akagawa 2009, 4). As the preservation of such events is not neces-
sarily a goal of intangible heritage practices, the ﬁeld relies upon documentation
practices. While intangible culture poses challenges for those heritage practitioners
who locate the authenticity of a site in a speciﬁc origin point, one proposed solution
is the framework of post-authenticity (Labadi 2010). In this revised view of heritage,
practitioners recognise that authenticity is, in fact, constant change that is marked by
‘gradual adaptations and additions due to new functions and fashions’ (76).

Another facet of intangible heritage is its widening of the conception of patri-
mony to include diverse cultural practices, and arguments have been made for the
inclusion of social actions, political discourse, outward expressions of emotion, and
memory (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 2004, 57; Smith 2006, esp. 155, 158; Silverman and
Fairchild Ruggles 2007, 12; Byrne 2008, 155; Samuel 2008; Smith and Akagawa
2009, 4–5; Harrison 2013, 114–139). This revised deﬁnition of heritage expands the
possibilities of the ﬁeld exponentially and, in doing so, leads us to consider the rela-
tionships between previous and emerging forms of heritage. Certainly new methods

of deﬁning, staging and preserving ephemeral culture are required to meet
challenges of considering both material and intangible heritage forms in tangent.

the

To this end, this study takes up the problematic case of a particular form of
sociocultural expression, that is, political grafﬁti at heritage sites. Although grafﬁti
can be deﬁned neutrally as those markings on surfaces which were not intended to
receive them (Plesch 2002, 168), grafﬁti has been widely understood to conform to
the wider motivations behind illegal vandalism, categorised as damaging to property
(Merrill 2011). In contrast, the political grafﬁti addressed in this study may best be
understood as part of a heritage of collective protest that is rooted in a tradition of
communal processions dating back to Santiago’s colonial era.

The presence of grafﬁti on historical sites presents challenges to heritage mainte-
nance, and traditional heritage practices have prescribed its removal. In particular,
the fear of heritage decay, in traditional practice, gives rise to mechanisms for the
preservation of material heritage over threatening grafﬁti (Peckham 2003, 4–5;
Bendix 2009, 254). In this view, grafﬁti
is understood as contaminating ‘dirt’
(Douglas 2002, 50) that must be excluded if a pattern of authenticity is to be
maintained for the material monument, as well as ‘chronological pollution’ (Hamann
2008) that interferes with the temporal stability of heritage sites.

Despite negative perceptions of grafﬁti, human actors have been marking privi-
leged places for centuries as forms of social action and collective memory. For
instance, since at least the sixteenth century, the pilgrimage site of the Oratorio di
San Sebastiano at Arborio, a town located west of Milan, has been one such
recipient of textual grafﬁti (Plesch 2002). From 1531 to 1889, pilgrims and towns-
folk inscribed texts, ﬁrst in Latin and then in Italian, over the religious frescoes
of the church’s interior. In a dense palimpsest that covers much of the church’s
interior walls,
the messages record meteorological and military events together
with other local news, hence preserving an alternative history of Arborio that is
of concern to the town and the historical community. The Red Army grafﬁti at
the Reichstag (Baker 2002) stands as a more recent instance of monument-based
grafﬁti of social and historical importance, as it was created in 1945 by Russian
soldiers documenting the end of ﬁghting in Berlin. Despite a modernisation pro-
ject in the mid-1950s which eliminated much of this grafﬁti on the Reichstag,
some 200 messages were rediscovered under plasterboard in 1999. These surviv-
ing Cyrillic scripts name soldiers, express personal statements of victory,
list
march routes and are understood to constitute a window into the conclusion of an
important historical era.

As scholarly investigations have revealed such grafﬁti to be of historical and cul-
tural value, the perceived merit of grafﬁti-as-heritage is beginning to take shape. Of
relevance to the present study, emerging scholarship has encouraged heritage profes-
sionals to recognise the signiﬁcance of communal expressions of conﬂict and protest
at heritage sites, particularly on artistic and political grounds (Merrill 2011, 72). It
has been argued that some examples of grafﬁti, both at and away from heritage sites,
may be included within an expanded deﬁnition of heritage due to ‘academic and cul-
tural signiﬁcance’ as ‘mirrors of contemporary society’ (63). Furthermore, the cul-
tural signiﬁcance of political grafﬁti as a form of protest heritage may be assessed
through a series of factors, including the motivations of the author and the form and
location of the markings (62–63).

Yet the recognition of culturally reﬂective grafﬁti-as-heritage does little to resolve
the problems that such markings pose for other heritage sites. Is grafﬁti-as-heritage

738

sufﬁciently part of the narrative of a monument such that it should remain in situ? Or
are there elements within grafﬁti which are ‘beyond acceptable public decency’ (Nash
2013)? To further explore this line of questioning, and to point out that preservation
is not a goal of intangible heritage, we take up the case of the grafﬁti at the Iglesia de
San Francisco in Santiago. Speciﬁcally, we examine the political grafﬁti along its
north wall during 2013, a year in which political expression dominated the national
cultural landscape.

Heritage and politics in Santiago
Alongside of the landmark political events that took place in Chile during 2013,
including presidential elections and the fortieth anniversary of the military coup of
1973, a blossoming interest in the preservation of cultural patrimony also gained
momentum, particularly in Santiago. Following a period of democratic stability, eco-
nomic growth and internationalisation, many argue that it is vital for santiaguinos to
invest in the upkeep of their urban cultural heritage. The cause of restoring life to
the vestiges of Santiago’s historical architecture has been taken up by numerous
institutions: the Municipalidad de Santiago, the Ministerio de Obras Públicas, the
Consejo de Monumentos Nacionales (CMN), and by university centres, such as the
Centro del Patrimonio Cultural at the Pontiﬁcia Universidad Católica. Yet strong
institutional participation in patrimonial recovery is no guarantee of popular support,
and efforts to promote Chilean national heritage have found themselves to be, at
times, in tension with open political discourse. The conﬂicts in Santiago posed by
the political grafﬁti on this heritage site are perhaps best examined in the light of the
wider current shifting perspectives of the notion of heritage.

Traditional heritage preservation has literally run up against a wall of conﬂict in
the case of the political grafﬁti at the Iglesia de San Francisco in Santiago, a national
monument on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites (Figure 1).

for
pro-restorationists, patience had run low for the aesthetic of urban decay that had
plagued the north face of the Iglesia de San Francisco in recent years (Figure 2).
Their preservation efforts were met with resistance; as government agencies strained
to remove spray paint and layers of banners, representatives of workers’ groups,
student groups and leftist political parties promptly remarked the wall.

that political street art

The strong reactions that this grafﬁti elicited from both sides of the debate
indicate that the Iglesia de San Francisco and its north wall grafﬁti produce different
combinations of aesthetic, religious and cultural values for different audiences
(Gillman 2010, 21). In this study, we categorise these audiences in two broad
groups: a traditional faction aligned with the church community and governmental
institutions that desire to maintain the Iglesia de San Francisco north wall in a
manner consistent with traditional understandings of heritage preservation and a
populist faction for which the wall functions appropriately as an ever-changing
pizarra del pueblo (‘blackboard of the people’) for political grafﬁti and banners.

The title of this study is drawn from a banner that was ﬁxed to the north wall of
the Iglesia de San Francisco in advance of the national presidential election of 17
November 2013 (Figure 3). The phrase ‘las demandas populares no caben en las
urnas’, or ‘popular demands don’t ﬁt in the ballot boxes’, refers broadly to the per-
ceived lack of inclusive platforms for open collective participation and the need for
additional venues for individual free expression. According to political scientists,
Chile maintains a highly institutionalised democracy with low levels of direct partic-
ipation and consequently a strong sense of exclusion among youth,
indigenous
minorities and the working class (Altman and Luna 2010, 306). Furthermore, as

Kunkle (1978) has pointed out, the oppositional right has historically controlled the
major media in Chile. Within this context, political grafﬁti is a collective activist
practice understood to enhance participation in government (Cameron 2014).

In an effort to explore both sides of the debate between traditional heritage
preservation and the continuance of political grafﬁti at the Iglesia de San Francisco,
we begin by describing the church’s role as an early colonial
treasure and by
addressing the relevance of the north wall site along a historically signiﬁcant avenue.
We then explore the contemporary function of the Iglesia de San Francisco’s north
wall as a ‘billboard’ for graﬁteros and particularly for political slogans in advance
of marches, memorials and elections. In recording the political grafﬁti that reﬂects
Chile’s key democratic events of 2013, we ﬁnd that the wall is indeed a lively
sounding board utilised by numerous leftist interest groups and hence constitutes a
cultural record that arguably falls within the scope of intangible heritage.

Data
Data for this study are derived from two projects undertaken separately at the north
wall of the Iglesia de San Francisco in Santiago, Chile, during 2013. The ﬁrst of
these projects was designed by the head conservator at the Iglesia de San Francisco,
Fanny Canessa et al. (2013). Her study not only records the grafﬁti content, but also
surveys public opinion of this grafﬁti at the north wall during political marches
(35–54). A separate photographic series by art historian Catherine Burdick also con-
tributes data to the current study. This series of images tracks the political grafﬁti on
the Iglesia north wall at three key political moments of 2013. Taken together, these
studies demonstrate the role of the north wall as an open sounding board for diverse



741

leftist interest groups and therefor arguably support the case for the inclusion of
these markings within the scope of intangible heritage.

The Iglesia de San Francisco as a heritage site
The importance of the Iglesia de San Francisco as a national historical monument is
intrinsically linked to its status as Santiago’s oldest existing colonial building
(Figure 4). Upon their arrival to Santiago in the mid-sixteenth century, the Order of
St. Francis was entrusted with sheltering an icon of the Virgin Mary which founder
Pedro de Valdivia had allegedly brought to Chile (Barrios Valdés 2003, 34–35). In
1622, the Iglesia de San Francisco became the Franciscan’s ﬁrst large-scale perma-
nent construction in Santiago, and the Virgen del Socorro (‘Virgin of Mercy’) was
installed in the high altar. In 1647, the church and its adjacent convent emerged rela-
tively unscathed from an earthquake that otherwise levelled Santiago. Although the
original church tower collapsed in the quake, most of the walls and the cruciform
foundation were spared, as was part of the mudejar ceiling; currently, the Iglesia de
San Francisco is irreplaceable as perhaps the oldest colonial structure in all of Chile.
It was during his stint as US ambassador to Chile from 1939 to 1953 that Claude
Bowers learned that the Iglesia de San Francisco was likely to undergo demolition
(Bowers 1958, 45–46). In no small way, as a result of Bowers’ intervention, in
1951, the Iglesia de San Francisco was instead declared a national historical monu-
ment by the CMN, thereby placing the church in the care of the state. For the
Chilean architectural historian Fernando Pérez, the preservation of such colonial
architecture currently serves as a reminder to Chileans of ‘who they are’ in an
increasingly global setting (Pérez 2012, 27–29).

Despite its importance as a national treasure, the Iglesia de San Francisco has
faltered in formally attaining international recognition as a heritage site. In 1998, the
Chilean Monuments Council proposed that the Iglesia de San Francisco be placed

Figure 4.

742

on UNESCO’s tentative list of World Heritage sites (UNESCO 2011). Although the
Iglesia clearly meets requirements as a historical monument and has long served as
a safe haven, UNESCO has not been provided with adequate criteria for selection,
that is, documentation of the church’s patrimonial worth and importance for human
history.1 Hence, the Iglesia is unlikely to progress beyond UNESCO’s Tentative List
without signiﬁcant effort, and the unsightly grafﬁti that has marred its north wall
does little to convince an international selection community that Chileans hold this
building in esteem. By 2013, the grafﬁti and banners on the north wall had not only
become unsightly, but had caused noticeably damage; chunks were missing from the
wall where banners had been torn away. Even more lamentable was the threat to
Chile’s oldest colonial window and to the wooden door of Saint Anthony (Figure 5).

The Alameda
One cannot discuss the relevance of the Iglesia de San Francisco as a symbol of
Chilean heritage without mention of the historical street which its north wall has
faced for nearly ﬁve hundred years (Figure 6). Since Santiago’s early years, this ave-
nue has been the site of diverse community gatherings and processions. Originally a
tree-lined public promenade, it was called the Paseo de La Cañada for its role as a
major route between two high points (Thayer Ojeda 1904, 11). In the seventeenth
century, Chilean historian Alonso de Ovalle described the paseo from ﬁrst-hand
knowledge as ‘the best situation in the city’ for both its cooling breezes and for its

strolling high society (Ovalle 1646, 153). During Holy Week and on feast days, the
secular function of the avenue was set aside for religious processions which left
from the Iglesia de San Francisco and continued along La Cañada (167).

The Alameda, as the street came to be known, retains its original function as a
promenade in its current role as an authorised protest route. In recent years, march-
ers have regularly processed past the north wall of the Iglesia from (or alternately,
to) the Universidad de Chile and La Moneda, thereby linking the north wall to a
politically charged audience. Hence, from the sixteenth century to the present day,
the long north wall of the Iglesia de San Francisco has offered a nearly unbroken
‘billboard’ in view of a continual viewership passing along the Alameda, albeit a
group that is ever-larger and moving by at an ever-quicker pace. In fact, it has been
said that Chilean street art is aimed at this audience in motion and particularly at the
estimated 200,000 commuters that move daily along this thoroughfare (Campos and
Meller 2007, 12).

The north wall grafﬁti interest groups
Because of its previously described location along a main avenue and protest route,
the Iglesia de San Francisco north wall is an ideal site for posting political grafﬁti.
In 2013, demonstrations and grafﬁti here reﬂected upon free education, the military
dictatorship and election platforms. Our studies of the north wall grafﬁti in 2013
document participation in this alternative communication channel for diverse leftist
interest groups that range from student organisations and workers’ unions to political
parties and minor presidential candidates.

The slogans documented on the Iglesia north wall conform to a textual and
communal tradition of Chilean political grafﬁti. While freestyle spray paint and

744

stencils make an appearance, the messages are predominantly expressed on painted
banners (aﬁches) and modern photocopied ﬂyers that are created off-site, often in
multiples, and pasted to the wall by teams under cover of darkness. In addition to
these aﬁches frequently boast acronyms or
their slogans and announcements,
emblems to convey the sponsoring organisations. As described in Table 1, Canessa
V identiﬁes four interest group categories represented by the north wall grafﬁti, three
of which have a priori political connections: student organisations, unions and
social-artistic organisations (members of the fourth category, ‘independents’ may be,
but are not necessarily politically motivated). Canessa V has identiﬁed nine known
interest groups on the Iglesia north wall grafﬁti between March and July 2013.

Similarly, a photographic study of the north wall grafﬁti by C. Burdick during
2013 permits both actors and their messages to be traced temporally and aligned
with speciﬁc political events. The ﬁrst photographs, taken on 27 June, reﬂect the
series of student-led marches past the Iglesia de San Francisco that took place on 13
and 26 June and again on 11 July in promotion of free education. In the second set
of images, the north wall grafﬁti memorialises the fortieth anniversary of the military
coup which took place on 11 September 1973. Finally,
images taken on 14
November are brimming with electoral propaganda in advance of the 17 November
presidential election. Table 2 synthesises these ﬁndings into interest group categories
organised by date using the categories proposed by Canessa, with the one additional
category (Political Groups and Electoral Campaigns).

Taken together, our data indicate that

the north wall functions as a rapidly
changing palimpsest for the open exchange of ideas among leftist interest groups, its

grafﬁti quickly removed or covered over as new political issues come to the fore-
front. The participants of this conversation are diverse; their proﬁles include local
and international associations, recently formed organisations and established groups
that weathered the military dictatorship. One surprise is the presence of the Frente
Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez, a radical leftist movement best known for their assas-
sination attempt on Pinochet in 1986 (See Figure 3). With over twenty distinct
organisations represented in our combined studies, the Iglesia de San Francisco
north wall is arguably a constantly updated channel of discourse that ﬁts conceptions
of intangible heritage as a reﬂection of society.

Interviews with the public at the north wall
In an effort to analyse the diverse views of santiaguinos regarding the north wall
grafﬁti and its impact upon the Iglesia de San Francisco, twenty interviews were
recorded at the site of the north wall during a march in support of free education
(Canessa et al. 2013, 35–54). Five interviews were undertaken with members of the
church community, nine from passersby, observers and tourists and six from protest
participants. All interviews were video-recorded and later transcribed into verbatim
notes. Interviewees were identiﬁed by gender, approximate age and their self-
identiﬁed role as church members, march observers/passersby/tourists, or march
participants. Although the sample size for this group of interviews is small, they are
informative for their diversity of viewpoints and for the ways that these viewpoints
strongly align with traditional views of heritage preservation (for church members
and march observers) on one hand and with the revised scope of intangible heritage
on the other (for protestors).2

With one exception, interviewees who self-identiﬁed as members of the Iglesia
de San Francisco community fall in line with promoters of traditional notions of her-
itage preservation in their condemnation of the grafﬁti. This group reported feelings
of derision regarding the grafﬁti and banners and described them as destructive
vandalism that fails to respect the building’s status as a historical monument and
functioning church.

What catches your attention on this wall?
… the way in which it has been preserved despite attacks from the environment and
from people who mark, paint it …

What is your opinion in respect to the marks?

… these marks have no value, except to those who make them, and they are generally
some type of propaganda, and I ﬁnd that they dirty, destroy, and contaminate … my
opinion is that they should not be here, they should not be here. The question is, how
can it be stopped? (Male, age 67, member of the congregation)

What is your opinion in respect to this wall?

What I know is that the wall is historical … Today, it is a place that people give little
importance to, people mark it, glue posters, in one week it is painted, after two hours it
is painted again … people don’t value what they have, there are so few historical
buildings, and the ﬁrst thing people do is paint them …

The main façade is almost not marked, on the other hand the north façade is entirely
marked. Why do you think this is so?



747

Ultimately, there have been problems related to marches. The north façade is rather
neglected day and night, the police are concerned about the main façade but not about
the other walls.

Do you think that these marks have any message?

(They are) about the marches, political messages. (Male, age 25, employee of the
Museo San Francisco)

I want to ask you speciﬁcally about the wall.

It is a typical wall for Franciscan churches. Here in the center of Santiago they do what
they want with it. Those who paint it are not poor.

What do you think are the motivations of those who paint?

There are none, they paint to paint. These are miserable youth, they are spoiled rich
kids.

Which type of marks and in which part (of the wall) are they bad?

They are bad everywhere. (Female, age not reported, nun)

Are you against these markings?

Of course! Would you like it if they marked your house? No one likes their house
marked.

What do you propose?

I think there is no solution until there exists a degree of conscience within the commu-
nity … this contamination detracts from the city. (Male, age not reported, priest)

Among the interviewees with close ties to the Iglesia de San Francisco, only one
stands out for reporting tolerant attitudes towards the grafﬁti in spite of her recogni-
tion of the symbolic role of the wall itself.

With respect to the north wall, what opinion do you have?
This red wall I ﬁnd rather emblematic … this building appears (on television), and
everyone recognizes it as the Iglesia de San Francisco … Some see the markings as
vandalism, but others like myself see it as a form of protest … They view the walls as
great chalkboards … (Female, age not
the Museo San
Francisco)

reported, employee of

Taken altogether, members of the Iglesia de San Francisco community express
feelings of negativity regarding north wall grafﬁti,
the rapidness with which it
reappears and the ongoing problems of political grafﬁti related to protests. Another
dimension of these interviews is the multitude of reported negative conceptions
towards the perpetrators of these marking and banners, understood to impart a
youthful disrespect for history, a lack of education in national heritage and an
uncultured disregard for the religious function of the building. From this vantage
point, these interviewees may be seen to be aligned with views of traditional her-
itage preservation in their regard for grafﬁti as vandalism and an undesirable mani-
festation of urban social unrest, a problem for which this group sees no solution
without a shift in Chilean cultural norms.

Another group aligned with traditional conceptions of heritage was comprised of
persons who self-identiﬁed as protest observers, passersby, or as tourists. The
following interview excerpts typify their responses.

748

C. Burdick and F. Canessa Vicencio

What opinion do you have in respect to the wall?

It is national patrimony, it is terrrrrribly old, it is a church. The people use this wall to
protest, but they shouldn’t mark it up because it is patrimony. They should protest in a
different way.

What does it mean to you that it is patrimony?

That it is old and has to be respected, it is historical.

Do you think that people who mark this (wall) don’t give importance to the build-
ing?

In general, the people who mark are less educated, and have less understanding. …
Furthermore, they mark (the wall) because it is where the marches assemble and this is
the ﬁrst thing they see. (Male, high school student age 17–18, observing the march)

What do you think of the markings?

This is what people do who have no culture, the delinquents, they write things without
knowing what they mean, they do it for evil, for resentment, out of ignorance … they
say that ignorance is bliss. There are ways to capture our thoughts, in a book, the
radio, art, but not marking national patrimony. (Male, approximately age 40, passerby)

What is your opinion of the wall?

That it should be better respected … imagine how old it is, it has much value for its
antiquity and is not protected, it is completely marked. It should be restored … some-
thing more professional.

Something to resist the marks?

Of course … and create a consciousness so that the youth is more respectful … A bet-
ter upbringing! (Male, approximately age 50, observing the march)

What stands out in these negative responses to the grafﬁti is not their consensus that
it looks unattractive, is tied to protest activity and conveys disrespect for a historical
monument. Rather, once again, the repeated characterisation of the grafﬁti makers as
‘less educated’, ‘lacking culture’ and in need of an enriched civic ‘consciousness’
suggests a perceived classist divide between presumably well-educated advocates
for the pristine preservation of Chilean heritage and those perpetrators whose actions
demonstrate the inadequacies of their upbringing.

In contrast to the previous responses, the third group of interviewees, protest
participants, nearly unanimously reported favourable opinions regarding the north
wall grafﬁti. Although some questioned their aesthetic merit,
they nevertheless
concluded that the wall should remain a functioning space for the open exchange
of ideas.

What is your opinion of the wall?
It should be occupied as a medium of expression … since tons of people pass here
they have to take advantage of it. You understand, these are national monuments, the
marked and ugly things, we have to do beautiful things in which the people participate
together with Chilean artists. (Male, approximately age 30, march participant)

What opinion do you have of the wall?

To me, the wall seems excellent with all of these protests. The wall is alive …

Are you in agreement with eliminating this grafﬁti?



749

The wall is constantly marked and repainted. It has to be cleaned so that new ideas can
appear. That’s what walls are for in this case.

What opinion do you have upon knowing that it is a national monument?

And does it have to be a national monument? It has passed many generations, it is a
traditional wall, but is also public … The church has to be part of the community.
(Woman, approximately age 70, march participant)

What is your opinion of the wall?

I think that it is urban protest, a white wall is a mute community. I am a graﬁtero and
it doesn’t bother me, what does bother me are the advertisements. Being a church, it
makes more symbolic sense to express oneself upon it. (Male, age 20–25, march
participant)

What is your opinion of this wall?

… it is important to have spaces for people to convey their opinions … I cannot under-
stand what they say, but it is valuable that people express their opinions, and if we
don’t give them space, they have to take it. (Woman, approximately age 55, thought to
be a march participant, [she interrupted another interview in progress])

What stands out in these excerpts is the importance given to grafﬁti as a necessary
medium of free communication for the ongoing formation of new ideas. Further-
more, the notion of the church as part of the broader community, whether a national
monument or not, is understood to frame its wall as an appropriate site for such
expression. Within this group, we ﬁnd an example of a self-identiﬁed graﬁtero (graf-
ﬁti artist), and his response reﬂects the conceptions of street art that emerged during
the 70s, particularly the notion that grafﬁti competes with, and hence neutralise,
capitalist street advertisements. Of particular importance to the present study, the
interviews with marchers form a viable basis for a theoretical consideration of the
north wall grafﬁti as intangible heritage for its conveyance of diverse political views,
as a socially inclusive medium for a public audience and as a transitory reﬂection of
rapidly changing socio political events.

North wall contingent political grafﬁti
Here we turn to a cursory examination of the grafﬁti’s contents, giving particular
attention to the messages posted in advance of three political events of 2013. For
the case of the student-organised marches in June and July, notices represent the
appeals of workers’ groups, socialist parties and student/youth groups. Their rhetoric
supports the primary demand of the protestors who marched past the wall, free
education (Gratuidad Educacional!). Secondary agendas include contemporary
‘Wei Chen
Mapuche politics (Mongeley Wei Chen Mapuche, marrichiweu!!,
Mapuche lives, we shall overcome tenfold!!’) and generic socialist rhetoric (A pirar
el capitalism, ‘stop capitalism’). Of note are the numerous texts that announce the
marches of June and July to potential participants and function as calls to action (26
junio todos al paro, ‘26 June everyone to the strike’) (Figure 7).

Of all the messages on the north wall, none are more emotionally charged than
the memorials posted for the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the military coup
that ousted President Salvador Allende on 11 September 1973. A message sponsored
by the Frente de Estudiantes Libertarios laments a perceived lack of meaningful
change since the coup: ‘A 40 años seguimos resistiendo, es hora de avanzar’ (‘At

forty years we continue resisting, it is time to advance’). The most moving message
is undoubtedly the meticulously crafted banner posted by the communist party of

Santiago: Con Allende siempre en la memoria y en la lucha del pueblo (‘With
Allende always in the memory and in the struggle of the people’) (Figure 8). In
keeping with traditional Chilean iconography for the memorialisation of political
martyrs, Allende’s portrait is stencilled in the centre of the banner.

Elections create opportunities for groups to develop and express agendas, and
the grafﬁti posted in advance of the 17 November presidential election focuses on
electoral candidates and campaign issues. The ﬂyers posted by CUT Chile (Central
Unitaria de Trabajadores), demanding an 8.8% increase in the salaries of public
employees, are representative of key issues under debate. Campaign posters solicit
votes for presidential candidates from minor leftist parties, including Marcel Claude
of the Humanist Party and Roxana Miranda of the Equality Party. Support for these
marginal parties, together with the absence of rhetoric in support of winning candi-
dates Michelle Bachelet and Evelyn Matthei, speaks to the role of the north wall as
a site for underrepresented interest groups. Taken altogether, this body of grafﬁti slo-
gans demonstrates the role of the north wall as a sounding board for alternative
political discourse and, in doing so, ties their messages to the greater contemporary
and historical contexts of Santiago’s political sphere.

The historical context of contemporary grafﬁti in Santiago
An examination of the Iglesia de San Francisco grafﬁti and the tensions it poses for
traditional proponents of heritage restoration require that we adjust our conception
of street art to ﬁt Santiago’s recent history leading up to and under the military dicta-
torship (1973–1990). Certainly grafﬁti has a peripheral history in Chilean art, and
until recently it has been aligned with political mural and poster production (Galaz
and Ivelic 1988; Castillo Espinoza 2006; Rodríguez Plaza 2011). More relevant to
the present study, murals and grafﬁti have been shown to have served numerous
functions in the service of Chilean democratisation, particularly within the tense
political climate of Santiago that extended from the mid-1960s until 1990 (Chaffee
1993; Vicio and Osses 2009).

The roots of Chilean political grafﬁti are located in Salvador Allende’s 1964
presidential campaign, during which leftists sought creative solutions to the ﬁnancial
disparity between the ﬁnances of their candidate and those of his wealthier opponent
Eduardo Frei (Cleary 1988). Grafﬁti was mobilised as a cheap and hip campaigning
strategy, and volunteers set about marking public spaces with Allende’s famous X.
Under Allende, grafﬁti, murals and posters took on social functions; for instance,
they served as public discourse along the Alameda and as the catalysts of an infor-
mal literacy campaign (Castillo Espinoza 2006, 162 [note 160]). Emerging under
Allende’s Unidad Popular (UP), mural brigades such as the Brigada Ramona Parra
were perceived to advance society through their simultaneous democratisation of
mass communication and art (Longoni 1999, 26; Sandoval 2001, 69).

Predictably, the role of street art in Santiago changed radically following the
coup of 1973, and grafﬁti became an integral player in the dynamics between demo-
cratic repression and pushback. As the new government commandeered public
space, it quickly began a programme of ‘national cleansing’ that targeted existing
grafﬁti and murals (Hernán Errázuriz 2009, esp. Table 1; El Mercurio, September
15, 17, 22, 1973). Among the ﬁrst works to be painted out was the well-known
mural along the Mapocho River that narrated a history of the Chilean worker
(Rodríguez Plaza 2011, 32). Similar events occurred outside of Santiago, for

instance, in the nitrate town of Chacabuco in northern Chile, whitewashing took on
an even darker pallor. From 1973 to 1974, the remote town was repurposed as an
internment camp, and armed forces eliminated evidence of the prisoners detained
there by removing grafﬁti from the walls of the houses in which they were held
(Vilches 2011, 254).

It is within the historical context of the military dictatorship, its aggressive white-
washing programme and its harsh criminalisation of street artists that we might best
reﬂect upon current tensions in Santiago between those in favour of the Iglesia de
San Francisco as an open democratic platform and those who prefer its pristine
restoration. It takes little imagination to understand that while a classic restoration
would achieve pleasant visual uniformity and order associated with national histori-
cal sites, it would likely be perceived by many to be a form of silencing that echoes
the repressive measures of the past.

Conclusions
Responding to recent reconsiderations of the scope and deﬁnition of heritage, this
article proposes to include political grafﬁti at heritage sites within the theoretical
framework of intangible heritage. Using the case study of the political grafﬁti at the
Iglesia de San Francisco in Santiago, Chile, this study argues that grafﬁti can in fact
function as a relevant mirror of contemporary society, a description which locates
this grafﬁti within the emerging theoretical framework of intangible heritage. Fur-
thermore, our records of the political grafﬁti at Iglesia de San Francisco, together
with an examination of public opinion regarding its perceived merit, have illustrated
how the interplay of heritage and vandalism has manifested in an intense debate
which risks the privileging of one form of heritage over another.



753

The recognition of the cultural or historical merit of some grafﬁti, however, does
not reconcile the inevitable clash between grafﬁti-as-heritage and the heritage sites
upon which it is imposed. To return to the line of questioning posed by Nash
(2013), is political grafﬁti a sufﬁciently relevant layer of the life of a monument that
it should remain in place? Intangible heritage appears to offer methodological com-
promise in this regard; as grafﬁti is intended to be created and read, but not neces-
sarily preserved, the possibility of documenting works prior to their removal would
arguably sufﬁciently preserve a record for future generations. In the case of the
Iglesia de San Francisco north wall, however, such documentation would not replace
or reconstitute the site’s greater function for community discourse as a pizarra del
pueblo.

This conﬂict between traditional heritage preservation and leftist expression
played out decisively at the Iglesia de San Francisco north wall and has resulted in
one-sided actions that may not have lasting effects. In September 2013, a Chilean
Supreme Court ruling mandated that as the custodian of national monuments, the
Municipalidad de Santiago is responsible for maintaining the north wall (La Nación
Chile, September 26, 2013). During December 2013 and January 2014, the walls
were cleaned, repaired and covered in a coat of anti-grafﬁti paint (El Mercurio,
November 17, 2013, C1) (Figure 9). Although this action has abruptly rendered the
present study a documentation of ‘historical’ material, it goes without saying that
without an alternative location for political discourse, grafﬁti will reappear on the
north wall (even if it is now easily removed); journalists caught the ﬁrst graﬁtero in
action during the 1 May 2014 International Workers’ Day protest (El Mercurio, 17
January 2014, A1, C13).
