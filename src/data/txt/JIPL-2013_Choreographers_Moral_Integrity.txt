Choreographers’ moral right of integrity
Francis Yeoh*

the dance

Background
In the past, the integrity of choreographic works was
breached more often than respected. Choreographers
such as Marius Petipa of the Russian Imperial Ballet
(1818– 1910) regularly re-choreographed ballets created
by their predecessors without
seeking permission.
Petipa had restaged Joseph Mazilier’s Paquita in 1847
and Le Corsaire in 1858 when these works were choreo-
graphed only a year or two previously. However, atti-
tudes and tastes of
community have
changed, and dance works are currently reproduced
with greater respect paid to the original choreography.
This development has been gradual, and choreogra-
phers’ professional status was only established in the
20th century when they freed themselves from the
shackles of servitude in royal or aristocratic house-
holds, although some had previously lived a nomadic
life struggling to eke out a livelihood through less at-
tractive engagements. However, with independence
established, the choreographer’s professional survival
was supported by the growth of national and inter-
national ballet companies that provided secure employ-
ment as resident choreographers or artistic directors.
These institutions have a precarious existence and have
been dependent on either private or public subsidy.

Clive Barnes, dance critic, claimed that ‘the sanctity
like
of choreography is a 20th century invention,
and television. . . . [I]t was Mikhail
human rights
Fokine and his impresario, Serge Diaghilev, who really
conceived the idea of choreography as we understand it
today.’1 It is not surprising therefore to discover that
dance only featured in copyright law in the United
Kingdom’s Copyright Act 1911 when it was deﬁned
under the category of ‘dramatic works’.

The growing popularity of ﬁlm musicals between the
1930s and 1950s widened the scope of employment for
choreographers; their works began to reach a much
wider public beyond the conﬁnes of the proscenium
arch. Agnes de Mille,
following in the footsteps of
Balanchine, introduced a higher standard of choreog-
raphy and the technical ability of the dancers, followed
by Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse who cultivated the
‘integrated’ musical and encouraged the development

itates immediate access in digital infrastructures. Chor-
eographers who participate in the entrepreneurial ex-
ploitation of their works are therefore forced to acquire
a greater awareness of the complexity of copyright.
Generally choreographers are more concerned with the
maintenance of the integrity of their works in perfor-
mances. However,
this concern is
affected by the socio-cultural factors that determine the
independence or otherwise of choreographers. The
major factor that determines the choreographer’s atti-
tude towards acquiring copyright citizenship is the fact
that the ‘market’ for their works had been limited (it
still remains so today for a majority of the profession):
traditionally they rely on the infrastructure of the insti-
tution that employs them or on individual commis-
sions to support their creative work. Accordingly, the
desire to exercise ownership rights has less priority.2
For the majority of choreographers, their work has
mainly been conﬁned to the theatre, although ﬁlm,
television and the internet have extended the scope of
employment.

the end of

A sea-change occurred at

the 20th
century as the choreographer’s attitude was signiﬁcantly
altered: copyright awareness was awakened by two im-
portant US cases on dance copyright: Martha Graham
School & Dance Foundation Inc v Martha Graham
Center of Contemporary Dance, Inc3 and Horgan v Mac-
Millan Inc.4 The ﬁrst dealt with the ownership of
Martha Graham’s dance oeuvre and the ‘work for hire’
doctrine, creating a furore within the dance commu-
nity.5 In the second, Barbara Horgan, executrix of Bal-
anchine’s will, applied for an injunction to prevent
MacMillan publishing Ellen Switzer’s book The Nut-
cracker: A Story and a Ballet, which contained 60
photographs of
the ballet and interviews with ten
New York City Ballet dancers. While that case was
settled before the hearings were completed, the Second
Circuit Court’s rulings on many dance-related issues

Choreographers who also direct presentations for
stage and screen, such as Jerome Robbins (West Side
Story and Fiddler on the Roof) and Bob Fosse (Sweet
Charity and Chicago), are able to exercise a greater
degree of agency. However, the priorities of the major-
ity of choreographers are different. In this regard,
Barbara Singer observed: ‘[T]hese economic rights are
not of paramount importance to most choreographers.
. . . And because his primary motivation is not money
but instead the need to make an artistic statement, his
primary concern is not with the economic rights
secured by the statute.’7 The proposition that the UK
moral rights approach does not adequately accommo-
date the choreographer’s expectations therefore merits
a closer investigation.8

The powers bestowed on choreographers were for-
mally introduced in the Copyright, Design and Patents
Act 1988 (CDPA) by its moral rights provisions. This
investigation will
therefore assess whether the UK
moral rights approach meets the expectations of the
dance community.

This article seeks to interrogate the dysfunction
between choreographers and copyright and will there-
fore focus on the relationship between moral rights
doctrine and the practices adopted by the dance com-
munity:
the intention is to evaluate the degree of
discord between choreographers’ expectations and the
UK moral rights approach.

The successful

lobby of nations which favour the
economic approach to copyright over the droit moral
approach has generated legislation that serves to dilute
and limit the rights of creative artists. This is particu-
larly apparent in the Agreement on Trade Related Prop-
erty Rights (TRIPS), which expressly excluded moral
rights. Another feature that exacerbates the choreogra-
pher’s problems is that national legislations within both

Francis Yeoh . Choreographers’ moral right of integrity

ARTICLE

common law and civil law jurisdictions have adopted
different approaches in regard to Article 6bis of the
Berne Convention.9 For example, the Australian deﬁn-
ition of derogatory treatment
is broader than that
adopted in the UK.10 Elizabeth Adeney has also high-
lighted the deletion of word ‘honour’ in the Irish legis-
lation and commented on its implications.11 However,
it is not possible within the scope of this article to
explore
these different
approaches. Although some choreographers’ works are
being disseminated widely in digital infrastructures, the
majority are limited to the theatre. This investigation
will, therefore, focus on the basic issues in moral rights
that are of immediate concern to choreographers in the
UK. Because of the parameters chosen, topical investi-
gations particularly those arising from the digital era’s
impact on moral rights will not be fully explored.12

ramiﬁcations of

fully the

The origins of the author’s moral rights in continen-
tal Europe can be traced to German and French 19th-
century case law. W R Cornish observes the European
approach to moral evolved organically: much of it is
‘in case-law, a process which bears a deﬁnite resem-
blance to common law method’.13 Cornish claims that
the concept of moral rights was ‘eloquently described’
by Lord Mansﬁeld in Millar v Taylor:14

He is no more master of the use of his own name. He has
no control over the correctness of his own work. He
cannot amend or cancel a faulty edition. Any one may
print, pirate, and perpetuate the imperfections, to the dis-
grace and against the will of the author; may propagate
sentiments under his name, which he disapproves, repents
and is ashamed of.15

However, Gillian Davies and Kevin Garratt contend:

The US approach reﬂects their resistance to the civilian approach to
moral rights. Although the USA joined the Berne Convention in 1989,
no statutory moral rights provisions have been incorporated into their
copyright law except the Visual Artists Rights Act 1990 (VARA). Under
VARA, a limited category of visual works, such as paintings, drawings,
sculptures, photographs and prints, enjoy the right of attribution and
the right of integrity. The US Committee on the Judiciary stated:

Based on a comparison of
its laws with those of Berne member
countries, and on the current status of Federal and State protection
of the rights of paternity and integrity, the Committee ﬁnds that
current United States law [which arose almost entirely outside the
Copyright Act, namely unfair competition, privacy, defamation, and
misrepresentation, the Lanham Act, etc.] meets the requirements of

right of the author to control ﬁrst publication high-
lighted what is now known as the right of disclosure
but otherwise gave short shrift to moral rights.’16 These
authors add that, before the 1988 Act, the UK relied on
‘the common law to provide protection to authors by
means of the law of contract, passing off, defamation,
injurious falsehood, slander of goods, breach of conﬁ-
dence and the general of torts.’17

UK legislative approach
Moral rights were formally incorporated into the UK
copyright regime by the CDPA in1988, giving the
choreographer the right not only to be recognised as
the author of a work but also to prevent its ‘derogatory
treatment’. Adeney provides this historical perspective
on legislation on moral rights:

In the decade following World War II the clearest progress
in the protection of moral rights was in the international
ﬁeld. France had not legislated for the rights and would
not do so until 1957, Germany was not to legislate com-
prehensively until 1965. And the copyright countries . . .
were at this stage virtually ignoring the rights.18

The UK right to object to derogatory treatment deﬁnes
‘treatment’ as ‘any addition to, deletion from or alter-
ation to or adaptation of the work’.19 However, such
treatment is only derogatory ‘if it amounts to distor-
tion or mutilation of the work or is otherwise prejudi-
cial to the honour or reputation of the author or
director’.20 Dworkin suggests that the UK moral rights
provisions favour ‘a detailed and complex moral rights
code’ instead of ‘a simple restatement of the general
principles set out in Article 6bis of the Berne Conven-
tion21 which would have left the courts with too free a

hand to work out how they should apply.’22 Article 6bis
had introduced the right of paternity and the right of
integrity, pursuant to the 1928 Rome Revision Confer-
ence of the Berne Convention: these rights subsist even
when the authors have transferred their economic
rights. The 1988 Act also restricted the term of moral
rights to the statutory period of copyright protection,
so they are not perpetual. The problem however is with
the ﬂuidity in the deﬁnitions of terms employed, which
raises uncertainty in the minds of commentators and
anxiety within the dance community.

The principal concern of choreographers and the
dance community centres on the preservation of the in-
tegrity of dance works. In practice, custodians of dance
works ensure that performances of the works under
their supervision retain the constitutive features of the
choreography and do not tolerate any ‘distortion’ and
‘modiﬁcation’. The idea that moral rights legislation
may provide legal protection needed to exercise the ne-
cessary control to preserve the integrity of dance works
is therefore attractive.

Leslie Kim Treiger-Bar-Am, on the subject of author-
ial intent, refers to the argument forwarded by Wimsatt
and Beardsly in their article ‘The Intentional Fallacy’,
which highlights the ‘distinction between a work, its
author’s intention, and its reader’s responses’:

Movements in literary criticism developed by extending
the role of the text itself as the source of the work’s
meaning, and then the role of the reader (or audience,
viewer).23

She notes that developments in intellectual property
law have ‘shifted from its pre-modern conception on
protection of action to its modern concept of protec-
tion of a thing’, positing that ‘the integrity right may
well be seen not as an intellectual property doctrine,
but from within the freedom of expression doctrine.’24
This subject is relevant to choreographers because in
their creative work they are both authors and users. In
this regard, Julie Van Camp posits:

Artists participate in an on-going dialogue within their
disciplines and the broader culture. They respond to works
already created. Works are not created in closets, devoid of
any inﬂuence whatsoever from the cultural milieu within

which artists are trained and to which they were exposed
during their lifetimes. . . . The problem then is to distin-
guish between those works which are merely ‘new’ works
and those which are merely ‘derivative’. How do we draw
that line?25

Another factor that continues to trouble the choreog-
rapher is the pressure of working in different media.
For example, Jowitt recounts an ‘unpleasant’ experience
for Robbins in NBC’s television 1980 programme fea-
turing the New York City Ballet in its new and much-
touted cultural venture Live from Studio 8H,
that
included his iconic works, Afternoon of a Faun, The
Cage and excerpts from Fancy Free, The Concert and
Dances at a Gathering:

Jerry had expected to be in control; instead he was pre-
sented with several different sorts of directors and some
ultimatums. He wanted to break the contract, but Balan-
chine wouldn’t hear of it, since the company’s repertory
and dancers
[New York City Ballet] were involved.
Robbins
loathed the resulting program but couldn’t
prevent it from being shown. According to Rhoda Grauer,
who worked with him on it, the experience was ‘horren-
dous’; she couldn’t imagine how he’d ever agreed to do it.
Perhaps, it was the high fee that had persuaded him, al-
though he had to sue NBC to get some of what he felt he
was owed.
‘Major network shit’, he called the whole
process, and had one word for it: ‘Ychacht!!!!!’26

Jowitt also commented that Robbins had ‘feared that
an inevitably imperfect performance would come to
stand for the work’.27

the accommodation of

It is argued that UK moral rights legislation, which
favours the economic approach, does not adequately
accommodate the choreographer’s concerns and that
the droit moral approach may have greater afﬁnity
with the desires of choreographers. Dworkin contends
that
right
holders has resulted in moral rights being introduced
with ‘such broad exceptions and qualiﬁcations and
waiver provisions that
they totally undermined the
rights themselves’.28 Further, Dworkin claims that they
were introduced ‘to placate different copyright interests
on the grounds that otherwise moral rights would
cause greater burdens than beneﬁts’.29 It is evident

from the historical traces of the adoption of moral
rights doctrine leading up to its formal adoption by the
Berne Convention that there was a strong resistance
from the nations that favour the economic approach to
copyright. In this regard, Dworkin highlighted that the
delegates to the Berne Convention had negotiated an
accommodation:

The compromise not only refrained from requiring nation-
al copyright laws to have express moral rights provisions,
but also tacitly acknowledged the protection ‘offered at
common law and equity by the common law countries of
the Berne Union was adequate for the purpose of the new
provision’.30

To illustrate, Dworkin cites the statement of Australian
delegate:

[O]ne of the arguments addressed to us was that it was
hard that we (the common law countries) whose laws,
gathered under various heads and found in various
branches of our system were together deemed to provide a
satisfactory protection for the interests in view, should
stand in the way of the establishment of its international
obligation to put laws in other countries on . . . proper
footing.31

this. Dworkin contends that

The history of moral rights in the UK legislation is in-
dicative of the reluctance of lawmakers to incorporate
them into the copyright infrastructure. The reports
presented by two signiﬁcant UK Committees before the
1956 and 1988 revisions of copyright law provide evi-
dence of
the Gregory
Report (1952) had examined the matter of moral rights
in a ‘fairly cursory way’32 by concluding that common
law and statute law met the United Kingdom’s obliga-
tion under Article 6bis of
the Berne Convention.
However, the Whitford Report disagreed. Dworkin sug-
gests that it was ‘inclined towards the introduction of
express legislative moral rights provisions’.33 Dworkin
writes that the Whitford Committee34 ‘recommended

Government had ‘changed its mind on the ground that
there is no such requirement in Article 6bis, a line of
argument it did not follow when dealing with other
parts of the moral rights code!’35 Nevertheless, signiﬁ-
cantly, these recommendations were recently revived in
the Hargreaves Review (2011).36

It is indicative of the UK’s economic approach37 that
the opening words of the CDPA 1988 states: ‘Copyright
is a property right.’ Would the French moral rights ap-
proach resonate more closely with the choreographer’s
expectations? In French law,38 the moral rights of the
author are perpetual. Adeney offers this ‘formulation’
of the French approach:

The type of wording to be found in the cases is illustrated
in the following formulation. The author was described as
having:
‘the inalienable and personal moral right of the
creative artist, directed at safeguarding the integrity of his
work against every deformation of his creative thought’ or
‘the absolute right to oppose any alteration, modiﬁcation,
correction or addition, no matter how small, that is apt to
denature his thought’ or ‘the moral right of control and of
supervision which [the author] retains over the products
of his intellect and which allows him to oppose any act
which compromises his work’s integrity and betrays his
thoughts’.39

The interpretation of the UK statutory provisions is
therefore central to any comparison between UK and
French law. In this regard, Copinger warns:
‘Indeed,
unless some such objective qualiﬁcation is imposed on
the words “distortion” and “mutilation”, the section
would pose great difﬁculties in its application, since the
words standing alone are highly subjective.’40

The varied and contradictory opinions of commen-
tators and the judiciary regarding the interpretation of
moral rights also continue to raise concerns for choreo-
graphers and the dance community.

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2013, Vol. 8, No. 1

Jane Ginsburg contends that moral rights are about
‘society’s commitment to the person. Not because she
is superior, but because that commitment beneﬁts all
of us in ways not readily captured by a pure investment
model of copyright.’41 Further, Augustin Waisman
argues: ‘Getting moral rights on the basis of “artistic
merit” would not only encourage arbitrariness, but it
would also expand the domain of
judicial decision
making to issues that bear no relationship to law.’42

On the subject of the breadth of the moral right of
integrity, Waisman contends that it is ‘not an absolute
right but a limited one’ and adds that ‘the harm to
reputation’ qualiﬁcation is only ‘a guide to the con-
struction of the right’. But he considers that it ‘still
leaves considerable room for interpreting what “reputa-
tion” means and, therefore, for arguing which modiﬁ-
cations of a work may be reasonably considered
harmful to its author.’43 He therefore suggests that ‘the
right of integrity can be considered infringed when a
modiﬁcation may potentially affect the way in which the
work is perceived by the public seems reasonable irre-
spective of whether a statute deﬁnes infringement by
reference to a harm to its author’s reputation.’44

Stina Teilmann explains that the philosophy driving
moral rights stems from Kantian philosophy: ‘The ma-
terial copy, “das Exemplar”, belongs to whomever has
bought it.’45 But it is the abstract element of the mater-
ial copy ‘die Rede’ that cannot be bought and sold, and
therefore the author ‘to whose name the book is tied—
has an exclusive right to his “Rede”: what he utters in
public, and that for which he is (in perpetuity) to be
answerable [verantworten].’46 Teilmann posits:

Hence there is a certain logic in returning to the source—
to the originator—of the justiﬁcation for moral rights.
Britain is a country without a tradition of moral rights.
This must be recognised when we attempt to register the
place of moral rights in British law.47

Both France and Germany provide that modiﬁcation
does not have to be detrimental to the author’s honour
or reputation before it is considered a violation of the

41

Jane C Ginsburg ‘Moral rights in a common law system’ (1990)
Entertainment Law Review 121-130, 121. In this regard, Adeney writes:
The history of moral rights development since the early 19th century
has been a history of sorting out the relationship between the various
participants in the creation/exploitation process. . . . The point of the
protection was to allow the creator the enjoyment of an inalienable
right to control the form and manner in which the work reached the
public. (Adeney, n 8, 4).

against relinquishing the moral right of integrity,’ Intellectual Property
Review, 2010, 2, 225, 232.

right of integrity and therefore the approach exceeds
the requirements of Article 6bis of the Berne Conven-
tion. In this regard, Mira T Sundara Rajan observes:

Moral rights in France focus almost entirely on the indi-
vidual rights of the author, with little overt attempt to
weigh the interests of
the author’s
desire. In contrast, developing countries—even those with
a common law heritage—and the post-socialist counties of
Central and Eastern Europe have routinely provided rigor-
ous legislative protection for moral rights. For these coun-
tries, moral rights undoubtedly represent a means of
prioritizing culture, creativity, and innovation in circum-
stances where they are desperately needed.48

for

The interpretation of the moral rights provisions by
the courts is therefore an important issue. Copinger
provides useful deﬁnitions
terms
employed: ‘Distortion of a work as a matter of ordinary
language, involves some form of twisting or perversion
of
it. Mutilation of a work involves some form of
cutting or destruction so as to render it imperfect.’49
However, Adeney notes the ‘narrow’ approach of the
UK moral rights provisions:

the various

The words ‘otherwise prejudicial’ here seem to suggest the
concept of toute atteinte´ rendered in English text of the
current Act of the Berne Convention as ‘other derogatory
treatment’, and intended to cover contextual abuses among
others. Nevertheless, the narrow deﬁnition of ‘treatment’
in the UK Act precludes purely contextual abuse. In other
words, the content of ‘derogatory treatment’ is used in the
United Kingdom not to extend the right but to conﬁne it
to a pre-Brussels ambit.50

Further, the UK legislation does not bestow these rights
in perpetuity but only for 70 years, a period similar to
copyright.

This tension between common law and civil

law
approaches to the right to integrity continue to trouble
choreographers. The observation made by Mark J
Davison and his colleagues regarding the Canadian case
Snow v Eaton Shopping Centre51 illustrates an approach
that may be favoured by choreographers. They write

Francis Yeoh . Choreographers’ moral right of integrity

ARTICLE

that ‘where O’Brien J said that the words “prejudicial
to his honour and reputation” involve a certain subject-
ive element or judgement on the part of the author so
long as it is reasonably arrived at.’52 This approach will
be attractive to choreographers for the reason that the
interpretation is more ‘ﬂexible’ than that adopted by
UK courts.53

In this regard, a persuasive argument is found in the
‘stewardship model’ advanced by Helena R Howe.54
She believes that the inﬂuence of concepts regarding
property in land is not detrimental. Rather, it is the
‘liberal model’ of property employed in conceptualising
copyright that is the problem.55 Howe has suggested
the ‘stewardship model’ as an alternative to the ‘liberal
model’:

What is more, the model of property is not purely of the-
oretical interest. There is some indication that land use is
undergoing a transition,
replacing a more traditional
understanding of ownership with a concept of ownership
based on the idea that the owner is a steward of that prop-
erty.56

Howe believes that the stewardship model provides ‘a
much more sympathetic ideological framework’.57 Al-
though we are minded of the choreographer’s major
concern with their moral rights of integrity, Howe’s
stewardship model does resonate with the ‘culture of
sharing’: a practice adopted by choreographers that
tolerates a measure of tolerance for borrowings from
each other. Joi Michelle Lakes adds:
‘Some tolerated
copying because it afforded them the opportunity to
learn from the works of their peers. Still others con-
sidered it inevitable, or even viewed it positively as a
form of free advertising.’58 Whether this practice will
extend to derogatory treatment is, however, an unlike-
ly outcome.

The relevance of moral rights to the
choreographer
As the choreographer’s main concern is the right to in-
tegrity, a common lament is that, without personal
supervision, such a work would receive inappropriate
performances which in turn would drive them to resort
to a claim of derogatory treatment. As previously dis-
cussed, the dance community provides a safe haven for
choreographers due to the good practices adopted that
serve to protect the choreographer’s interests.

choreographic

‘borrowings’ by

Sharon Connelly believes that the reason for the
choreographer’s complacency may be due to this pro-
tective environment and argues that ‘custom continues
to act as a formidable regulatory force within this
ﬁeld’.59 However, the recent controversy surrounding
the
the pop star
Beyonce´ has illustrated that, outside the dance commu-
nity, the increased interaction of dance works with
other art forms has exposed choreographers to possibly
greater opportunities for infringement since ‘outsiders’
do not recognize the customs of the dance community.
The controversy arising from Beyonce´’s borrowings
from the dance works of Belgian choreographer Anne
Teresa De Keersmaeker (Rosas Danse Rosas and Achter-
land) in her pop video Countdown has raised many
interesting questions.60 De Keersmaeker is an estab-
lished choreographer
in the modern dance genre.
However, her success does not equate with the stature
and income that Beyonce´ enjoys. De Keersmaeker
stated: ‘There are protocols and consequences to such
actions, and I can’t imagine she and her team are not
aware of it.’61 Whether De Keersmaeker was solely con-
cerned with the copying of her choreographer or
whether she objected to its treatment in the video, this
is a David and Goliath encounter as Beyonce´ has the
might of Sony behind her. Roslyn Sulcas reported that

Thus, under the stewardship model the owner should not be treated as
having the unfettered right in the ‘development value’ of the property.
This would seem to be the result of a combination of the fact that the
owner is under duties to conserve and to enhance the resources they
own for the beneﬁt of
the broader community and because the
community is perceived as having some ‘right’ in relation to the land
and the natural resources it supports.The landowner cannot claim an

labour of

entitlement to capture the value by exploiting the resources inherent in
the land which on this model might be said to belong to the whole
community in some sense. Thus, under the stewardship model there is
a difference between value which can be said to arise by the
independent
the owner and value which depends on
depriving the community or taking advantage of pre-existing value.
The owner has the right to the former only. (ibid, 201)

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2013, Vol. 8, No. 1

De Keersmaeker advised her company to instruct its
lawyer to write to Sony, producers of the Beyonce´’s
Countdown video,62 demonstrating how a choreograph-
er may be forced to rely on copyright law to protect
economic and moral rights.

The digital era has provided greater scope for the
choreographer’s creativity but concomitant with this
development is a loss of control that choreographers
had traditionally enjoyed within the dance community.
Charlotte Waelde and Philip Schlesinger,
in their
Report arising from their
investigations conducted
under their Arts and Humanities Research Council
(AHRC) sponsored project, Music and Dance: Beyond
Copyright Text, cited a participant’s statement to illus-
trate this plight of creative artists in dance and music:
‘There is a tendency in the 21st century for success to
only be applied to things that sell massively, or draw
massive crowds and so on.’63 This development has un-
doubtedly posed problems for choreographers since,
when their original works are being adapted for new
media presentations, control will usually be wrested
from them and they will be prevented from dealing
with derogatory treatment. It is the practice of produc-
tion companies to secure total rights to the products
created to facilitate the efﬁcient production and dis-
their products. An inevitable conse-
semination of
quence of
this practice is that choreographers are
trapped in an unequal bargaining position.

In the earlier part of the 20th century, choreogra-
phers were unable to exercise any control over the
reproductions of their works. Mikhail Fokine had com-
plained bitterly about
the mutilation of his ballets
when his contract with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes was
terminated and he was replaced by the impresario’s fa-
vourite, Nijinsky. When he re-joined the re-organized
Ballets Russes in 1937, after Diaghilev’s death, Fokine
stated: ‘I recognized all my steps. Only the groupings
had disintegrated. . . . Everything seemed to be lost, its
former force, characteristics and expressiveness, and its
former consistency.’64 Fokine was, of course, less con-
cerned with the replication of the steps he had devised
than with the other constitutive elements that contrib-
ute to the identity of his works. When he refers to the
‘former force’ he is, of course, alluding to the fact that
nuances in the movements have been ‘ironed out’ and

he laments that the ‘former consistency’ (totality of the
work) has been corrupted.

In resorting to litigation, choreographers will be
required to establish that alleged actions come within
the statutory deﬁnition of treatment and, further, that
these are prejudicial to their honour and reputation. It
is inevitable that in the determination of derogatory
treatment a court will depend on the testimony and
guidance of experts and, in this regard, the opinion
expressed by Isabel J Cohen, doyen of dance critics,
provides an opinion that can be employed to support
and at times corroborate the evidence tendered where
the kinaesthetic features of the choreography has been
altered:

Watch out here, though, for changing the original dynam-
ics might be dangerous. But then, do we want exactly the
same effect or can we welcome a fresh interpretation that
would enrich our experience of the work? But: Does that
interpretation still pay due respect to the original?65

The question of whether
standards
demanded by choreographers to maintain the integrity
of
their works in performance will be taken into
account in the determination of derogatory treatment
will arguably be advanced as
signiﬁcant. On this
subject, Gillian Davies and Kevin Garnett observe: ‘It
seems reasonably clear, however, that in the United
Kingdom the question is wholly objective (and this is
also how the meaning of a statement is judged under
the law of defamation).’66 The tenor of this will be at
odds with the practices adopted by the dance commu-
nity where the actions taken by custodians of dance
heritage such as the Balanchine Trust, the Robbins
Rights Trust, the Martha Graham Dance Centre and
the Merce Cunningham Trust have forcibly demon-
strated the great concern exercised to ensure that works
are appropriately staged. If a company’s performance
falls short of the acceptable standard, negotiations will
seek to resolve the shortcomings. In this regard, the
trustees have instituted a centralized licensing process
and employed qualiﬁed personnel
the
works.67 The monitoring of performances of dance
works is therefore more vigilant. While not all forms of
derogatory treatment of dance works are readily estab-
lished, more obvious examples are easily avoided. Doris

Francis Yeoh . Choreographers’ moral right of integrity

ARTICLE

51

Hering reported on the actions taken by Vitale Fokine
to ensure that the integrity of his father’s works is pre-
served: Fokine had asked for ‘minimum royalties’ so as
to ‘discourage unscrupulous organizations from debas-
ing his father’s ballets’ such as, the presentation of the
dancers on pointe in the dance drama Scheherazade
where the dancers originally perform in bare feet; or
presenting Les Sylphides as a tap dance.’68

controversial

Regarding Beyonce´’s

choreographic
‘borrowings’ for her video Countdown, Sulcas contends
that the video did not hide its borrowings from De
Keersmaeker’s Rosas danst Rosas (1983).69 But were
Beyonce´’s borrowings an infringement? Amos Barshad
demonstrated the similarities between the two works in
his YouTube posting, which incorporated a side-by-side
video of Beyonce´’s borrowings and the original from
Thierry de Mey’s 1994 ﬁlm, noting that ‘it is pretty
conclusive’.70 Barshad, observing that Beyonce´ had
done this before, contended that ‘every time Beyonce´
steals something, it’s awesome’.71 But has there been
substantial taking amounting to infringement? In this
regard Laddie et al refer to Morrison Leahy Music Ltd v
Lightbound Ltd,72 where a court had considered that it
is arguable that the appropriation of ‘short snatches of
music with its accompanying lyrics to form a compil-
ation (“megamix”) [had] altered the character of the
original composition by removing the part selected
from its original context and playing it
in a new
context’. This
ruling has persuasive authority to
support Beyonce´’s use of De Keersmaeker’s choreog-
raphy.

Sulcas describes the alleged borrowed movements:
‘shrugging, ﬂicking glances at each other and the audi-
ence, smoothing hair, tugging shirts up or down, wrap-
ping their arms around their waists—these sequences
of gestures are all in Countdown, as are almost identical
blocks of gestural movement, and it was thrilling and
tedious in almost equal measure.’73 Beyonce´’s legal
team may also raise the question of ‘originality’ of the
movements appropriated.74 In the likely event of litiga-
tion, the court may also consider not only on the ques-
tion of
infringement but also the idea/expression
doctrine, which limits authorial rights: it can be argued

that she borrowed De Keersmaeker’s ideas and not her
expression of the ideas.

However, what is relevant to this article is the prop-
osition that Beyonce´’s treatment is a parody. Different
considerations are engaged if this defence is pursued.
There is no UK case law on dance parody and therefore
little guidance is available. Michael Spence considers
that ‘no stable understanding of the term “parody”
exists’,75 the parodist being both author and user:

Good parody is both original and parasitic. So lawyers
have asked why this use seems different to other uses and
whether it can be afforded special treatment under the in-
tellectual property regimes.76

In this regard Dworkin writes:

The paradox is that whereas the courts in parody cases
sometimes want to avoid holding a parodist liable, the cre-
ation of an express integrity right reinforces the author’s
armoury against the parodist.77

Some commentators favour the Australian provisions
for parody and satire and others recommend the fair
use accommodation for parody in the USA. Sally
McCausland noted that there was ‘little time to con-
sider the issue of how moral rights would ﬁt with the
‘. . . any such claim
new parody or satire exception’:
would be subject to the concept of “reasonableness”
which qualiﬁes Australian moral rights.’78 The ruling of
the Supreme Court in the US case of Campbell v Acuff
Rose is signiﬁcant: it held that the ‘current deﬁnition of
parody has allowed certain works, completely devoid of
the elements of literary parody, to qualify as fair use
parodies’.79 The Supreme Court decided that the Sixth
Circuit Court had erred when it held that the 2 Live
Crew’s rap’s commercial nature was inherently unfair
and remanded the case for consideration whether
2 Live Crew’s parody harmed the market for a rap
version of the original.

Aside from the question of copyright infringement,
the Beyonce´ incident highlights the importance of main-
taining the delicate balance between the exclusivity of
author’s rights and the need of users to have access to
works, concerning which Mike Holderness has suggested:

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2013, Vol. 8, No. 1

Unless moral rights are preserved there is a danger that the
original work will be modiﬁed to make it commercially
‘successful’. Very quickly the vigour and variety of our
culture will degenerate into what is merely easy to sell.

The study of the history of performances of Fokine’s
masterpiece Les Sylphides reveals the different levels of
alterations that have been made to this classic. The
question as to whether these actions are derogatory
treatment depends to a large extent not only on the
customs adopted by the dance community as they may
serve as persuasive authority in court.

Les Sylphides was ﬁrst choreographed, in its present
form by Mikhail Fokine in 1908. It was originally
known as Chopiniana.80 The ballet was renamed Les
Sylphides by Diaghilev when he selected it to open the
ﬁrst performance of the Ballet Russe’s hugely successful
1909 season in Paris. There is no report of any objec-
tions to these treatments of the work, which range
from the ‘trivial’81 to those that are arguably deroga-
tory treatment. One example of an allegedly derogatory
treatment is the controversial presentation of Les Syl-
phides by Balanchine in 1972. He had presented the
dancers in white practice tunics instead of the trad-
itional
typiﬁes the Romantic
period style of the ballet. Balanchine had also reverted
to calling the ballet by its original title Chopiniana for
the New York City Ballet performances. Further,
Chopin’s pieces were played on the piano instead of the
usual orchestrated version. Arlene Croce claims:
‘He
imposed an experiment in distillation which failed’,82
adding:

length tutu that

full

With his misbegotten Chopiniana, Balanchine tried to
force the connection between Fokine’s masterpiece and his
own method. Possibly it’s a connection that can only be
sensed, not demonstrated.83

Although Balanchine in his restaging of this work had
not changed the choreography, he had altered the work
by deleting an element of the period tutu that is inte-
gral to the evocation of the Romantic period of ballet.

This investigation advances the argument that many
aspects of droit moral, the civilian law approach to

moral rights, are more sympathetic to choreographers’
endeavours to retain control over the their works. As
previously illustrated, even an astute choreographer
such as Jerome Robbins has failed to exert his rights on
a number of occasions. Robbins’s meticulous attention
to detail in his contractual dealings is legendary and his
contractual stipulations ensure he has absolute control
over his works. However, he did not reckon with Holly-
wood ﬁlm producers. Robbins had co-directed the
United Artists ﬁlm of West Side Story with Robert
Wise. Deborah Jowitt, dance
and critic,
observed:

scholar

Many in the entertainment business have heard that
Robbins was ﬁred by the executive producers, Harold and
Walter Mirisch. What is generally not known is that even
though Robbins left Hollywood with much of the movie
still to be shot, he had a great deal to say about the
editing, and Wise was as accommodating as he felt it pos-
sible to be.84

This compromise was perhaps taken so as to prevent
Robbins from taking legal action.

An action taken by the Balanchine Trust has convin-
cingly illustrated how the effective employment of the
law can prevent the unlawful treatment of a choreogra-
pher’s dance legacy. The trustees contacted YouTube to
prevent the unlawful posting of various segments of the
ballet La Sonnumbula or Night Shadow on the YouTube
Ketinoa channel. Ellen Sorrin, director of the Trust,
contended that the posted segments were unlawfully
obtained from an ABT archival tape. These postings
were therefore unacceptable since the recording was
not seen as a proper representation of the work.85 As
custodian of the Balanchine dance heritage, the Trust is
duty bound to preserve the integrity of his works both
in performance and in dissemination on the internet.
This event demonstrates how the employment of the
legal powers available to choreographers and their
representatives can be effectively employed to prevent
unlawful treatment of dance works. There is a danger,
however, that the choreographer’s agency will be threa-
tened by the provision in the 1988 Act of the waiver
process.

80

Les Sylphides was originally choreographed by Fokine in 1907 when he
was already established as a dancer, teacher and a choreographer of three
one-act ballets. In his memoirs Fokine said that Chopiniana was created
for the beneﬁt of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
in the year 1907. He used a ‘suite of Chopin pieces orchestrated by
Alexander Glazounov’ (Fokine, above, n 64, 93). Fokine had staged ‘ﬁve
short tableaux to the music. . . . Right then [he] conceived the idea of
creating a ballet such as Les Sylphides of maidens ﬂoating around a
solitary youth infatuated with beauty’ (ibid, 102).

Francis Yeoh . Choreographers’ moral right of integrity

ARTICLE

53

Provision for waiver of the right to
integrity
Because the concerns of choreographers and the dance
community are centred not on the economic factors in
the exercise of copyright powers but on artistic stan-
dards, their outlook on copyright is coloured by these
expectations. One provision that seriously concerns
choreographers is s 87 of the CDPA, which allows a
waiver process which can be employed to divest choreo-
graphers of their ability to exercise their moral rights.86
This innovation favours producers such as ﬁlm and tele-
vision companies but disadvantages struggling artists
who are placed in an unequal bargaining position.87 The
justiﬁcation advanced is that producers have to protect
their investments and therefore require greater control
over the production and dissemination of their pro-
ducts. On this subject, Lord Beaverbrook highlights the
difference between the concepts of consent and waiver:

irrespective of whether any particular act

Waiver . . . is the giving up of rights in whole or in part,
conditionally or unconditionally, revocably or irrevocably,
in favour of particular people or in favour of the whole
world,
is in
anyone’s mind. It is the sort of thing most likely to be
found in a contract, but not necessarily. . . . It cannot sens-
ibly, be called consent; indeed, it is not consent. It is not
saying: ‘I retain my right but consent to your doing that
act’, but ‘I waive my right and give them up. We consider
that we need a provision for both informal contract and
formal written waiver.88

Choreographers must therefore take the precaution of
contractually securing a clearer deﬁnition of their role
in the process of any adaptation of their works in
another media as well as to retain controlling powers
to ensure that the process does not result in a deroga-
tory treatment. Choreographers will continue to con-
front the pressures exerted by production companies
when their works are entrepreneurially exploited. As
Mike Holderness observes:

On the one hand is the realisation of the potential for
many-to-many media, in which moral rights form a ready-
made (but not universally applied) legal framework for
identiﬁcation and integrity of the individual works. On the

86 Dworkin refers to the US VARA which allows waiver ‘in certain

situations only and so is consequently more considerate of authors than
the United Kingdom’s Act which allow all moral rights, whether or not
in existence and whether or not of real relevance to the current
negotiations to be waived’ (Gerald Dworkin ‘The Moral Right of the
Author: Moral Rights and the Common Law Countries’ (1995) 19
Columbia-VLA Journal of Law and the Arts, 225, 252).

87 Martin Kretschmer ‘Artists’ Earnings and Copyright: a review of British

and German Music Industry Data in the Context of Digital
Technologies’ in Fiona Macmillan (ed) New Directions in Copyright
Law(2006), (Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, UK, Northampton, MA, US,

other is, to put it bluntly, the spectre of Bill Gates, Rupert
Murdoch, and a handful of other corporations owning sig-
niﬁcant parts of the culture outright—and having their
right to amend it as their commercial interests dictate.89

A recent manifestation of this phenomenon was high-
lighted when Natalie Wheen, writer and broadcaster,
drew the dance community’s attention to it by posting
the comment Rights Grab at The Royal Opera on the
Art Desk website (20 September 2010). Wheen pointed
to the moves made by The Royal Opera House (ROH)
to secure rights in commissioned works and claimed
that the ROH

is demanding that its entire stable of creative talent—direc-
tors, set and costume designers, lighting and special effects
designers, even composers, choreographers and libret-
tists—sign over to the Royal Opera House all their copy-
right in their work there—in perpetuity.90

The ROH’s plan to acquire greater control of commis-
sioned works seeks to facilitate the process of market-
ing the recordings of the Royal Ballet’s performances of
dance works: these products have become a lucrative
resource that will greatly contribute to the high cost of
maintaining the national institution which is heavily
subsidized by government
subvention and private
sponsorship.

This ROH plan follows the pattern adopted by the
major producers in ﬁlm and television media: their
main aim is to secure total control of the production
and distribution process of their products for the cul-
tural market. This method requires careful appraisal by
choreographers if they are to retain the desired control
over their creations. Wheen writes:

From the correspondence I have seen from the ROH’s
Legal and Business Affairs Department,
it appears that
these ‘all-rights’ contracts for the ROH Education Depart-
ment and ROH2 are already in place and non-negotiable. I
am told that the same conditions are also being required
for work to be done at the main house.91

The ROH replied that it had launched a ‘wide consult-
ation with the artists/creators and their managements

Vol. 2, Ch. 3, 61 –78), provides empirical information on this aspect of
the exploitation of the creative artist in the era of rapid dissemination of
their works in digital infrastructures.

about streamlining and updating its contractual frame-
work’92 and issued the following statement:

We recognize some of the comments attributed to the
Royal Opera House in the article but these are paraphrased
from correspondence relating to speciﬁc artists and speciﬁc
projects and applied to the general when in fact they repre-
sent a fragment of a wider discussion.93

The rationale frequently put forward is that derivative
works arising from productions requiring heavy invest-
ment must generate a healthy income. Therefore, for
ease of administration, the securing of total control
over rights of the creative team is justiﬁed. In this
regard, Wheen listed the reasons forwarded by ROH’s
Legal and Business Affairs Department, which she
gleaned from correspondence with several executives:

† As the ROH is commissioning new work it

is
entitled to acquire the entire copyright of the work
it commissions.
† Because the ROH is funded by the public purse, it is
not right that artists should be free to exploit their
copyright for their own beneﬁt, with the ROH only
having limited rights.
† Because many rights are involved in making a pro-
duction, the ROH should be in charge of all these
rights, making no exceptions, otherwise there would
be lots of difﬁcult administration details and asso-
ciated costs.
† Since the ROH will hold all the copyrights, it will
then be best placed to look after these rights—which
will be in its own interest: if artists held on to their
copyright, they’d have to protect their rights them-
selves.
† The ROH, in having all the copyrights in a produc-
tion assigned over to it, is then the right place to
allow future performances of the work.94

The reasons forwarded by the ROH are not unique as
the entrepreneurial exploitation of original works, par-
ticularly when works are collaborative in nature, will be
complex, usually involving a number of creative artists,
and seeking clearance for future use is administratively
time consuming.

The problems of establishing derogatory
treatment of dance works
The statutory deﬁnition of treatment includes ‘addi-
tions to, deletion from or alteration to or adaptation of
a work’.95 However, such treatment is only derogatory
‘if it amounts to distortion or mutilation of the work
or is otherwise prejudicial to the honour or reputation
of the author or director.’96 A crucial element in the
litigation process
the provision of evidence in
support of a claim of derogatory treatment: the task of
providing evidence can be arduous as normally there
will be no tangible evidence of the works by which one
may establish derogatory treatment.97 Dance is an
ephemeral art form and its ontological instability is the
outcome of the ‘oral tradition’ practised by the dance
community over the past three centuries. Documenta-
tion of dance has not been encouraged and the oral
tradition adopted by chorographers and re´pe´titeurs in
the creation,
staging and revival of choreographic
works, which necessitates rehearsals in studios, exacer-
bates the problem.

The problem is exacerbated by the high level of ac-
curacy that is required to establish derogatory treat-
ment: it is less arduous to comply with the copyright
prerequisite of ﬁxation in ‘writing or otherwise’.98 The
evidence required will involve a close examination of
the choreography to determine and identify infringe-
ment, but the available evidence may fail to provide
sufﬁcient proof in the absence of such elements as text
and scores. Although it is possible to ﬁx dance in
various tangible forms, such as video and ﬁlm, such
evidence can be challenged as being a secondary source
for it is only an interpretation of the choreographer’s
ideas by director or video maker. In seeking evidence
of greater accuracy, it has been argued that the notator
and the notated score may perform an important func-
tion, particularly from those who have worked closely
with the choreographer from the ﬁrst rehearsals in the
studio leading up to performances on stage. The claim-
ant will therefore have to supplement the tangible evi-
dence
from
expert witnesses.

tendered with corroborative evidence

A further complication in securing evidence to es-
tablish a claim arises from the practice of choreogra-
phers of
‘tinkering’ with their choreography. This
means that changes such as deletions, alterations and
restructuring frequently occur
in reproductions—

Francis Yeoh . Choreographers’ moral right of integrity

ARTICLE

particularly when there are changes in the cast. Further,
due to exigencies arising from change of venue and
stage space, there may be a reduction of the numbers
dancing the ensemble numbers. Over the years it has
also become accepted practice for costumes and sets to
be replaced in later re-staging, such as the Royal
Ballet’s revivals of Ashton’s Les Rendezvous and Rhap-
sody
and MacMillan’s Danse Concertantes. These
changes are arguably derogatory treatment as ballet
presentations traditionally adhere to the convention
that the sets and music are integral elements of the
dance work; these activities might have ended in litiga-
tion if made without the consent of the choreographers
or their custodians or heirs.

In recordings of dance works in other media, the
adaptation of three-dimensional dance works in theatre
performance to the two-dimensional recording on ﬁlm
or video, in inept hands, may result in changes that
amount to derogatory treatment, such as the inappro-
priate use of camera angles, that serves to destroy the
presentation of the choreography. Further, in accom-
modating the dance work for screen presentation, ele-
ments such as sets, stage lighting may be altered: the
resultant product may thus fail to retain the ‘truth’ of
the original. As dance works are conventionally a
fusion of the arts, their various components may be
deemed integral to the work. An adaptation placed in
the wrong hands, such as a director who has no experi-
ence in adapting dance for the screen, will inevitably
mutilate and distort the work. Therefore, in determin-
ing derogatory treatment in such instances, the guid-
ance of expert witnesses will be required not only to
corroborate the tangible evidence but also to provide
guidance to the court on the standards and practices
adopted by the dance community.

The dance community has adopted the idea that the
legitimacy of a performance is centred on ensuring that
the presentation of a dance work reﬂects the choreogra-
pher’s intentions. However, commentators have voiced
other approaches that reﬂect current debates in other
disciplines. On the question of
‘authenticity’ Sarah
Rubidge suggests that it involves making a ‘just recog-
nition’ of the work when viewing a performance:99 ‘Au-
thenticity is therefore not a property of, but something

we ascribe to a performance.’100 Chris Challis, com-
menting on interpretations of Paul Taylor’s works in
performances by The American Ballet Theatre, con-
tends:

There is a logical relationship between the choreographer’s
concept of a dance and the dancers’ interpretation of it:
the artistic ideas of the choreographer are realised only in
the technical, intellectual, and expressive abilities of the
dancers. . . . This does not stiﬂe interpretation, rather to
suggest that it takes place within a range of tolerance.101

The debate that surrounds the question of identity of
dance work is centred on the determination of what
are its constituent elements. Julie Van Camp proposes
that the process may require the separation of the cre-
ative from the interpretive elements, observing:

Dance critics use information external to a performance to
identify and separately evaluate the creative aspects of
dance (composition of music and movement; design of
scenery and costumes) and the interpretive aspects (per-
formance by dancers and musicians, execution of scenery
and costume designs). . . . In dance, it is difﬁcult to deter-
mine exactly which movements in a performance are the
design of the choreographer and which are strictly the in-
terpretation of a particular rehearsal director, ballet master
or dancer.102

She further suggests:

Legal determinations of identity directly involve the issues
of philosophical identity, and illustrate the viability of a
two-pronged test of identity using both notation (or ﬁx-
ation) to set an ideal absolute identity and a lay observer
test to apply that ideal and specify actual identity of specif-
ic performance.103

Dance companies, in order to claim legitimacy for a
production, have traditionally ensured that the per-
formance captured the essential elements of work.

It is necessary therefore to examine each case on its
own facts, but the process of determining its outcome
is arduous because of the lack of precedental guidance.
Derogatory treatment may arise from the restaging of
the dance drama, such as the works of Antony Tudor,
the presentation and interpretation would
where
require
close attention to interpretative
elements.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2013, Vol. 8, No. 1

Muriel Topaz provides an insight into the difﬁcult task
of restaging his works and the subtlety of the interpret-
ive process:

It is the responsibility of the reconstructor to recreate as
much as possible the atmosphere and techniques of a
Tudor rehearsal. One needs to know that Tudor studied
Stanislavsky and Delsarte;
is
‘acting’ or being overtly ‘emotional’
in his works. But,
rather, one must ‘be’ the character.104

that abhorrent above all

Davies and Garnett raise an important observation in
this regard:

To what degree must the result of the treatment resemble
the author’s work. In the case of copyright infringement
there is a requirement of substantial similarity but no such
requirement exists in relation to the integrity right and it
seems that an alteration can amount to a treatment even if
the works are not substantially similar.105

Parallel applications of case law from
other disciplines
As there is a paucity of case law on the subject of the
moral rights relating to dance, precedents from case
law in other disciplines may be considered for parallel
applications. As discussed in Morrison,106 the defen-
dants had produced a recording using a medley of the
words and music from Morrison’s compositions mixed
with music from other composers. The plaintiffs
claimed that
the Mechanical-Copyright Protection
Society (MCPS) had no authority to license the modiﬁ-
cation without their consent. The court, on an applica-
tion for summary judgement
for infringement and
moral rights, considered the changes in the music and
the lyrics to be modiﬁcations. Holding that
those
changes did not alter the work in the music element,
the court nevertheless considered that
there was a
triable issue in relation to the lyrics. As previously illu-
strated, this type of treatment can be found in dance
presentations. The principle enunciated in this case
may have parallel applications.

Confetti is another unsuccessful claim on the unlaw-
ful treatment of music.107 Confetti Records, a small
record label, paid Andrew Albee (the third claimant)
£300 for the rights to the track ‘Burnin’. The claim was

that the treatment by the defendants of the track for
their album ‘Crisp Biscuit’ was derogatory ‘because all
coherence of the original work has been lost as a result
of the superimposition of the rap’. Lewison J disagreed:

I do not infer any prejudice from the fact that The Heart-
less Crew [a leading act within the UK Garage scene] rode
the rhythm right through the track. If I am to draw any in-
ference I would draw, having listened to the original mix
of ‘Burnin’, is that it was designed to be the background
track to a rap.

Adeney noted that Lewison J ‘considered the question,
noting, ﬁrst, that s80 is clearly intended to give effect to
Article 6bis of the Berne Convention’.108 Lewison J stated:

It is clear that in article 6bis the author can only object to
distortion, mutilation or modiﬁcation of his work if it is
prejudicial to his honour or reputation. I do not believe
that the framers of the 1988 Act meant to alter the scope
of the author’s moral rights in this respect. Moreover, in
the compressed drafting style of the United Kingdom legis-
lature, the work ‘otherwise’ itself suggests that the distor-
tion or mutilation is only actionable if it is prejudicial to
the author’s honour or reputation. . . . I hold that the mere
fact that a work has been distorted or mutilated gives rise
to no claim, unless the distortion or mutilation prejudices
the author’s honour or reputation.109

Another relevant case, BPI, considered the use and
treatment of the plaintiff ’s works in a megamix pro-
duction. BPI’s licensing scheme disallowed any modiﬁ-
cation that ‘alters the character’ of the work but the
Tribunal held that the standard set was ‘vague and un-
necessary and unreasonable’.110 The Tribunal therefore
decided that, unless there is prejudice to reputation,
the modiﬁcation is not sustainable under s 80.

In the visual arts, two cases on derogatory treatment
provide further illustrations of the variable nature of the
judicial interpretation of the right to integrity. In Paster-
ﬁeld111 the moral rights claim arose from the use of a
cutaway design in a leaﬂet. Alternations to the cutaway
were a reduction of its size, different colouring and the
absence of certain features found in the original. The
court held that the treatment was not derogatory as the
differences between the original and the new leaﬂet were
insigniﬁcant and hard to distinguish. In Tidy112 the car-
toonist objected to the Museum’s use of his drawings of
dinosaurs. Likewise, the court rejected the application

Francis Yeoh . Choreographers’ moral right of integrity

ARTICLE

for summary judgement, and the reason given was that
the court was not satisﬁed that the reduction in size and
change in background colour amounted to derogatory
treatment.113 In this regard, parallels can be found in
dance as many works are altered when works are pre-
sented in different theatres— and particularly so in tele-
vision or ﬁlm studios. Normally alterations occur with
the consent of the choreographers but if this is not so, a
claim of derogatory treatment can be made.

In this era of fast-expanding dissemination of dance
works, the ability of the choreographer effectively to
prevent derogatory treatment of
their works will
depend on how effectively moral rights can secure the
desired protection. The UK courts’ tendency to inter-
pret the moral rights narrowly will therefore serve to
discourage choreographers, who are already disen-
chanted with the outcomes of litigation because of the
difﬁculty of adducing evidence to prove a claim and
the costs of litigation particularly when the outcomes
are unpredictable.114

Dance parody and moral rights
Turning to parody in the performing arts Christian
Rutz asks: ‘As parody is a cultural phenomenon with a
long history and growing importance in the United
Kingdom and continental Europe, the question should
be asked whether parody is adequately dealt with under
copyright law.’115 There is not a single case precedent
on dance parody. Nevertheless there is a diversity of
opinions in legal commentaries that may assist this as-
sessment on dance parody and moral rights.

Michael Spence believes

relationship
between a parody and the text upon which it is built
varies enormously’:

that

‘the

Some parodies, often called ‘speciﬁc’ parodies, are built
upon particular texts; others, often called ‘general’ par-
odies, are built upon whole artistic traditions, styles or
genres. Some parodies, often called ‘target’ parodies, seek
to comment upon the text or its creators; others, often
called ‘weapon’ parodies, involve the use of that text to
comment upon something quite different. Some parodies
merely hint at the text, assuming their audience to be fa-
miliar with it; other parodies both present the text and
comment upon it at the same time. Some parodies exploit

the disjunction between the parody and the text to comic
effect, others do not.116

The legitimacy of parodic use will pose problems to
choreographers due to the lack of certainty of its limits,
and this problem will be particularly relevant for works
in the postmodern genre where deconstruction of the
dance canon is more than likely to occur. There have
more obvious examples of parody in dance works that
would unlikely be considered as unlawful treatment.
For example, Robbins’s ballet The Concert
(1958)
silent movie and dance cliche´s. Matthew
parodies
Bourne had included a parody of the Romantic ballet
in an interlude in his ballet Swan Lake (1997) but he
employs only the movements and mannerisms of that
genre. While these exercises in parody are arguably not
derogatory treatment, the determination of such treat-
ment is fraught with difﬁculties.

Examples of parody in dance performance abound
in the presentations of Les Ballets Trocadero de Monte
Carlo: while the performances of the troupe of cross-
dressing transvestite dancers are controversial, the ques-
tion is whether the presentations can be considered as
derogatory treatment. The
received
popular acclaim through performing a wide range of
ballets in their repertoire that embraces both the clas-
sics and contemporary works. Although its technical
skills are phenomenal and its replication of the chore-
ography is to a great extent accurate, its treatment of
the works is very much a reﬂection of its philosophy.

company has

it

Nevertheless,

is in their interpretation of

the
choreography that is open to question as amounting to
derogatory treatment. Tony Dobrin, Artistic Director of
the company, claims that it is ‘a comedy company,
doing a comedy dance show’.117 Even its name is a
parody: it is not a company that is resident in Monte
Carlo but traces its heritage back to the Ballets Russes
de Monte Carlo that toured the USA in the forties. The
views of experts such as dance scholars and critics may
be employed as persuasive authority.

The ‘Trocks’, as the company is popularly called,
perform a version of Fokine’s Les Sylphides that is ar-
guably a derogatory treatment of canonical ballets.
Although the choreography is meticulous in its replica-
tion of the choreography, it does not reﬂect the essence

of the work which is an evocation of the Romantic era.
The Romantic style and delicacy of the work has been
sacriﬁced for comic effect with exaggerated gestures and
a heavy dose of parody on the manners of the ballerinas
of this period ballet. Sean Watson provides this account
of its performance of another classic, Swan Lake:

Mackrell provides a justiﬁcation for the Company’s
treatment of famous works:

Not only do the Trocks know ballet history, they are
junkies for its aesthetics. . . . Having got the crowd happy,
the dancers are then free to lose much of the slapstick and
work their genius for pastiche and parody.120

Perhaps the most joyous aspect of the company’s comic
power is their obvious devotion to and love of classical
ballet. Villain Van Rothbart (Rafaele Morra), prances exag-
geratedly around the stage in excellent mock-Russian
dramatic style and Swan Queen Odette (Robert Carter)
marvellously plays up the Prima Donna Ballerina,
frequently cueing her willing audience for lengthy ap-
plause. Feathers ﬂy and the dancers squawk and peck to
the audience’s delight. The visual gags delight but it’s the
exceptional skill of the dancers underpinning the slick pro-
duction which bewitches. Subverting expectations,
the
dancers gel in a manner only the most renowned classical
ballet ensembles can hope for.118

Ian Palmer, in his critique on the company’s perform-
ance of Go for Borocco, created in 1974, which parodies
Balanchine’s Concerto Borocco (1941), writes that the
dancers ‘are never afraid to send up those Balanchinean
moments such as when the ballerinas appear as the
Graces, threading in and out of each other’s entwined
arms (think Concerto Borocco and Symphonie Concer-
tante) but here having them tied up in knots as tight
and as complicated as those of a ﬁsherman.’119 Judith

The difﬁcult question of how far ‘over the top’ must an
alteration of this nature go before it becomes unaccept-
able and deemed to be a derogatory treatment of the
original work and also as being prejudicial to the repu-
tation and honour of the choreographer. It will be difﬁ-
cult to answer with any certainty.

Old practices, new challenges
This investigation has revealed that the UK moral rights
provisions do not fully accommodate the particular con-
cerns of choreographers, particularly that the constitu-
tive elements of
their dance works be treated as
sacrosanct. Uncertainty remains as to the outcome of
litigation, accompanied by the doubts in choreographers’
minds over the effectiveness of their copyright. The chor-
eographer’s reliance on the good practices adopted by
the dance community may have provided protection,
but this is no longer tenable when the wider dissemin-
ation of dance in other media greatly alters their pos-
ition. Choreographers can no longer be complacent
about securing and retaining copyright of their works.
