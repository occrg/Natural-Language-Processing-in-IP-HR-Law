Human Rights and the Cultural
Heritage of Indian Tribes in 

the United States

dean b. suagee*

1 introduction

Half a century after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the indigenous peoples of the world seek recognition by the international com-
munity of their human rights, especially rights associated with living as self-
governing communities within their traditional homelands. For most indige-
nous peoples, the connections between culture and homeland are fundamental
(cid:209)indigenous cultures need their roots in the territories of their traditional home-
lands. For many indigenous peoples, their very survival as distinct human cultures
may well depend upon whether the international community recognizes these
human rights and whether it acts to stop violations of these rights.

People in the industrialized countries who express concern about the fate of
indigenous peoples may be motivated both by self-interest and by principle. In-
digenous peoples possess a wealth of traditional cultural knowledge about their
homelands, knowledge that may be used to serve the interests of people in the in-
dustrialized world. Those who are motivated by principle tend to express support
for the human rights of indigenous peoples, including the right to continue to
exist as distinct cultures.1 These different kinds of motivations are not necessarily
contradictory and may well prove to be complementary. If indigenous peoples can
survive the current wave of assaults on their cultures and their homelands, non-
indigenous governments and nongovernmental organizations could (cid:222)nd them-
selves working in partnerships with indigenous peoples to pursue common envi-
ronmental conservation objectives for many generations into the future.

human rights and cultural heritage 49

This paper addresses two of the legal instruments in the emerging interna-
tional law of the rights of indigenous peoples: the Draft United Nations Decla-
ration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples2 (hereinafter Draft UN Declaration)
and the Proposed American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples3
(hereinafter Proposed American Declaration). The presentation in this paper em-
phasizes the provisions in these two declarations that address what may be broadly
described as cultural heritage.

In recent years, the United States of America has become actively involved in
the deliberations on these two declarations. Unfortunately, much of what the
United States has said in the international arena has not been informed by its own
experience with Indian tribes. Although the U.S. Department of State has engaged
in the pretense of consultation with representatives of Indian tribes regarding the
two  declarations,  the  individuals  in  the  State  Department  who  speak  for  the
United States in the international arena have generally ignored the counsel both of
those who speak for the tribes and of those in other branches of the federal gov-
ernment with expertise in Indian law and policy, in particular the Departments of
the Interior and Justice. Because the United States does in fact have a great deal of
in(cid:223)uence in the international arena, and because what the United States has said
is so ill informed, this paper devotes substantial attention to the experiences of In-
dian tribes in the United States and some of the inconsistencies between the po-
sitions taken by the United States and its own body of domestic law.

The United States has a long tradition of recognizing the right of Indian
tribes to live as self-governing culturally distinct communities, although the ad-
herence of national policy to the principle of tribal self-government has been, to
say the least, inconsistent. In fact, in two historical periods the United States car-
ried out policies designed to destroy tribal governments. In addition, throughout
much of its history, the United States has supported the (cid:210)development(cid:211) of natural
resources in ways that have in(cid:223)icted suffering on tribal cultures by causing dam-
age to the communities of other living things on which tribal cultures have de-
pended for hundreds or thousands of years. Over the last quarter century, federal
policy toward Indian tribes has supported tribal self-government, and tribes have
become increasingly prominent in governing their own territories. They also have
increasingly made it known that their concerns about the natural world often ex-
tend far beyond the boundaries of their reservations.

Part 2 of this article presents some introductory observations on the rela-
tionships between tribal cultures in North America and the environments of their
traditional homelands. Part 3 offers a brief discussion of the basic principles of
federal Indian law in the United States, as well as an overview of the history of
federal policies relating to Indian tribes and their members. Readers from other
countries may think that this part of the paper is intended mainly for their bene(cid:222)t.
As any lawyer practicing in the (cid:222)eld of federal Indian law can attest, however, this

50 dean b. suagee

is a subject about which the average U.S. citizen knows very little. Indian tribes oc-
cupy a vulnerable position in the U.S. system of government, and lack of knowl-
edge on the part of the U.S. public contributes to this vulnerability.

Part 4 examines the Draft UN Declaration, with an emphasis on rights relat-
ing to the survival of indigenous peoples as distinct cultures. This part also offers
some critical commentary on the role of the United States in shaping the princi-
ples of this emerging (cid:222)eld of human rights law, calling attention to some of the
key points on which what the United States has said in the international arena is
contradicted by the experiences of the United States in its dealings with Indian
tribes. Part 5 presents some rather brief observations on the Proposed American
Declaration, again with an emphasis on the provisions dealing with culture.

2 tribal cultural heritage and 
the natural world

The cultures of American Indian tribes hold a wealth of knowledge about the nat-
ural world, knowledge that re(cid:223)ects the presence of tribal cultures in North Amer-
ica for countless generations and the variety of ways in which these cultures are
deeply rooted in the natural world. Prior to contact with Europeans, tribal cultures
provided for the material needs of people through agriculture, hunting, (cid:222)shing,
and gathering. In many modern tribal cultures, wildlife continues to be essential
for meeting subsistence needs. In most modern tribal cultures, some people still
know how to use wild plants for healing. In all modern tribal cultures, connections
to the natural world remain important aspects of Indian identity. At the core of
tribal cultures are tribal religions. Many places in the natural world hold religious
and cultural signi(cid:222)cance for tribal peoples, some because of events that took place
there, some because people conduct religious ceremonies and practices there, some
for reasons that no outsider has a right to know.

In tribal cultures, places that are regarded as sacred tend to be located in areas
where the web of life has not yet been disrupted by human activity. The web of life
in such places may re(cid:223)ect hundreds or thousands of years of the presence of
human cultures, but it has not been ripped apart by the kinds of activities that in-
dustrialized cultures allow to take place under the banner of (cid:210)development.(cid:211) Many
of the nonhuman kinds of living things that make up the web of life in such places
(what human policy makers now call (cid:210)biological diversity(cid:211) or (cid:210)biodiversity(cid:211)) hold
signi(cid:222)cance in tribal religions and cultures(cid:209)eagles, wolves, salmon, ravens, coy-
otes, buffalo, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass, to mention just a few.

Because tribal cultures are rooted in the natural world, protecting the land and
its biological communities tends to be a prerequisite for cultural survival. Much
has been written about whether tribal cultures embody values that can be described
as environmental ethics or, to frame the inquiry in the past tense, whether the cul-

human rights and cultural heritage 51

tural values and practices of tribal peoples enabled them to provide for human
needs and wants without causing irreparable damage to their environments.4 Re-
becca Tsosie recently reviewed a substantial amount of the literature on this topic
and concluded, after raising the usual cautions about generalizations, that, for most
indigenous cultures of North America, traditional Indian worldviews can be de-
scribed as having several common aspects: (cid:210)a perception of the earth as an animate
being; a belief that humans are in a kinship system with other living things; a per-
ception of the land as essential to the identity of the people; [and] a concept of
reciprocity and balance that extends to relationships among humans, including fu-
ture generations, and between humans and the natural world.(cid:211)5

A basic premise of this paper is that the most effective way to make use of the
traditional ecological knowledge of indigenous peoples is to recognize their rights to
govern their own territories. The national and subnational governments of the world
should support these rights by showing the same kind of respect toward indigenous
peoples that they show in their interactions with other governmental entities. This
premise is based, in part, on the historical experience in the United States, which has
shown that tribal self-government is a prerequisite for cultural survival.

Another premise is that recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to gov-
ern themselves in their own territories will not be enough, in and of itself, either
to ensure their survival as distinct cultures or to make sure that people who are in-
volved in preserving biodiversity have access to the traditional ecological knowl-
edge of indigenous peoples. This second premise is also based on the U.S. expe-
rience. In the United States, most tribal governments currently have jurisdiction
over only a small fragment of their aboriginal territory.6 Yet most tribes do have
strong economic, cultural, and religious interests in places that are located outside
the boundaries of their reservations. Federal law provides a variety of mechanisms
through which tribal governments can in(cid:223)uence the decisions made by other units
of government (federal, state, and local) that affect such off-reservation places.
One such legal mechanism is the consultation process established by the National
Historic Preservation Act,7 which can be used to provide a measure of protection
to places that hold religious and cultural importance for tribes. Assuming that self-
governing indigenous peoples in other countries have similar concerns outside
their territories, some mechanisms to empower them to make their views known
on activities that take place outside of their self-governed territories will be advis-
able if the outside world is to bene(cid:222)t from their traditional ecological knowledge.

3 tribal self-government in the united states

In the United States, the federal government currently maintains government-to-
government relations with more than 500 federally recognized Indian tribes, in-
cluding more than 200 in Alaska.8 The tribes exhibit a great deal of diversity

52 dean b. suagee

among themselves, and one should be cautious about generalizations. Indian res-
ervations exist in thirty-three of the (cid:222)fty states. Some twenty-four reservations
are larger in area than the smallest state (Rhode Island), while some reservations
are only a few acres in size.9 Many are located in rural areas; some are adjacent to
or surrounded by metropolitan areas. With one exception, tribes in Alaska do
not have reservations, although they do provide a wide range of governmental
services.

Throughout this article, the terms (cid:210)Indian(cid:211) and (cid:210)Indian tribe(cid:211) are used, rather
than some possible alternatives, because these terms have common meanings in
federal law.10 This article also uses the term (cid:210)Indian country(cid:211) as that term is used
in federal law, a term that includes all lands within the exterior boundaries of any
Indian reservation and all (cid:210)dependent Indian communities.(cid:211)11

In the United States a complex body of law has established that Indian tribes
have a special status in our federal system of government. This body of law, gen-
erally known as federal Indian law, has evolved over the course of more than two
centuries and includes treaties, laws enacted by Congress, decisions of the courts,
and various kinds of policies and decisions issued by the executive branch of the
federal government.12 Throughout most of American history, the basic principles
of federal Indian law have remained remarkably constant, even though federal poli-
cies toward Indian tribes have been anything but constant, periodically shifting be-
tween supporting the tribal right of self-government and forcing Indian people to
become assimilated into the larger society.

3.1 foundation principles
Any attempt to summarize the foundation principles of federal Indian law must
necessarily leave out a great deal. There are, perhaps, four key doctrines, each of
which is interrelated with the others: inherent tribal sovereignty, reserved tribal
rights, the federal trust responsibility, and the plenary power of Congress.

Inherent tribal sovereignty means that the source of a tribe(cid:213)s governmental au-
thority comes from within itself and that its existence predates the founding of the
United States. Since the era in which the sovereigns of Europe entered into treaties
with them, the tribes have been recognized as possessing their own sovereignty. In
1941, the (cid:222)rst edition of Felix S. Cohen(cid:213)s treatise on federal Indian law summarized
the doctrine of inherent tribal sovereignty:

The whole course of judicial decision on the nature of Indian tribal powers
is marked by adherence to three fundamental principles: (1) An Indian tribe
possesses, in the (cid:222)rst instance, all the powers of any sovereign state. (2) 
Conquest renders the tribe subject to the legislative power of the United
States and, in substance, terminates the external powers of sovereignty of
the tribe, e.g., its power to enter into treaties with foreign nations, but does

human rights and cultural heritage 53

not by itself affect the internal sovereignty of the tribe, i.e., its powers of
local self-government. (3) These powers are subject to quali(cid:222)cation by
treaties and by express legislation of Congress, but, save as thus expressly
quali(cid:222)ed, full powers of internal sovereignty are vested in the Indian tribes
and in their duly constituted organs of government.13

Over the past two decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has changed this third
principle, by holding that the power of Congress to take away (or divest) certain
aspects of inherent tribal sovereignty need not be done through express legislation
but rather can be done by implication.14 The doctrine of inherent tribal sover-
eignty, however, remains a cornerstone of federal Indian law.

The doctrine of reserved tribal rights has its roots in treaties, transactions in
which tribes gave up their rights to large areas of land, in exchange, in part, for
promises from the federal government to protect the tribes in their right to gov-
ern themselves in the lands that they reserved to themselves. In this sense, a treaty
was a grant of rights from a tribe to the United States, with a reservation to the
tribe of all rights not given up. The land that a tribe did not give up became known
as its (cid:210)reservation.(cid:211) Within its reservation, a tribe was assumed to retain all the
rights that it had not speci(cid:222)cally given up in its treaty. In a number of treaties,
tribes also reserved certain kinds of rights outside the boundaries of their reser-
vations, such as the right to harvest (cid:222)sh. The term (cid:210)reserved rights(cid:211) is also used
to describe rights reserved by the federal government for the bene(cid:222)t of tribes, es-
pecially rights to the use of water, which might otherwise be allocated among non-
Indians pursuant to state law. After 1871, when Congress ended the practice of en-
tering into treaties with Indian tribes, many reservations were established through
executive orders issued by the president. The establishment of such executive-order
reservations has been held to include reserved water rights for the bene(cid:222)t of the In-
dians. Thus, while the concept of reserved rights has its roots in treaties, a tribe
need not have a treaty to have reserved rights.

The doctrine of the trust responsibility has its roots in cessions of land from
tribes to the United States and the promise to protect the rights of tribes to gov-
ern themselves in the lands they had reserved.15 The trust responsibility can also be
traced  to  the  doctrine  of discovery,  under  which  the  European  sovereign  that
claimed to have discovered a particular part of the New World acquired legal title
to the land, which was exclusive with respect to other European sovereigns but
which nevertheless did not include the right to possess the land(cid:209)the right of pos-
session still belonged to the Indians.16What the sovereign acquired was the exclusive
right to persuade the Indians to give up their right of possession. Thereafter, all ti-
tles to land had to be traced back to the sovereign. In 1790, the (cid:222)rst U.S. Congress
enacted a law that re(cid:223)ects this principle, requiring congressional authorization for
any transaction through which an interest in Indian land was acquired.17

54 dean b. suagee

Under the trust doctrine, the federal government holds legal title to most In-
dian land and has (cid:222)duciary obligations like those of a trustee. The federal govern-
ment(cid:213)s trust responsibilities to the tribes are not limited to the management of land.
Rather, the protection of the land base is, and always has been, instrumental to the
tribal right to maintain a separate existence as a self-governing community. Ac-
cordingly, Congress has explicitly acknowledged that (cid:210)the United States has a trust
responsibility to each tribal government that includes the protection of the sover-
eignty of each tribal government.(cid:211)18 As explained by Mary Christina Wood, (cid:210)the
core principle of the trust doctrine remains a duty to protect a viable native sepa-
ratism and tribal sovereignty.(cid:211)19 She identi(cid:222)es four (cid:210)attributes of sovereignty(cid:211) that
warrant protection under the trust doctrine because they are necessary for native
separatism: (cid:210)(1) a stable, separate land base; (2) a viable tribal economy; (3) self-
government; and (4) cultural vitality.(cid:211)20

The plenary power of Congress is a double-edged sword. Under the Consti-
tution, the federal government is vested with authority over relations with Indian
tribes, authority that is exclusive, that is, not shared with the states.21 Under the
plenary power doctrine, the power of Congress exceeds the scope of its constitu-
tional underpinnings but has nevertheless been upheld by the Supreme Court
based on the duty of protection arising from the dependency relationship with the
tribes.22 Congress has often used this plenary power to divest Indian tribes of
rights and powers, and the Supreme Court has never invalidated such an act of
Congress.23 On the other hand, the plenary power of Congress has been used to
prevent state governments from interfering with tribal self-government. In the
American federal system, most of the con(cid:223)icts over which government has au-
thority in Indian country are con(cid:223)icts between the tribes and the states. The ple-
nary power doctrine has been relied upon by the Supreme Court in fashioning a
principle that tribal law carried out in a framework of federal law can preempt the
(cid:222)eld, leaving no room for the exercise of state authority.24

3.2 vacillations in federal policy
While the basic principles of federal Indian law have remained fairly constant, fed-
eral policy has vacillated between supporting the tribal right to carry on as cul-
turally distinct self-governing communities and trying to destroy tribal cultures
and force individual Indians to become assimilated into the larger society. The his-
tory of federal Indian policy can be described as being comprised of (cid:222)ve distinct
eras: the formative years, from the founding of the United States until about 1871;
the allotment era, from then until about 1928; the Indian reorganization era, until
about 1942; the termination era, until about 1961; and the self-determination era,
which is the current federal policy.25 During the formative years, the establishment
of reservations was the basic mechanism for maintaining separation between tribal
cultures and the expanding American population. Most tribes managed to keep

human rights and cultural heritage 55

small portions of their aboriginal territories, but many other tribes were forced to
move to reservations away from their homelands. Under both scenarios, the basic
policy supported a (cid:210)measured separatism(cid:211)26 for the tribes.

The allotment era takes its name from the General Allotment Act of 1887.27
During this era, the federal government tried to force Indians to give up their
tribal cultures and become assimilated into the larger American society. The
principal mechanism for accomplishing this objective was to take tribal lands,
which were held in common, and divide these lands into allotments for individ-
ual tribal members; the remaining so-called surplus lands were then made avail-
able to non-Indians.28 The results of allotment included the loss of possession
of about two-thirds of the Indian land base29 and the contemporary presence of
a substantial number of non-Indians living within the boundaries of many In-
dian reservations.

With the enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934,30 Con-
gress repudiated the allotment policy. The IRA returned to the policy of sup-
porting a measured separatism, although the degree of tribal autonomy was lim-
ited both by the structure of the IRA and by the way in which it was carried out
by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).31 The IRA encouraged tribes to
adopt constitutions, but the standard constitution promoted by the BIA did not
re(cid:223)ect tribal customs and provided the BIA with much discretionary power. By
1940, more than two-thirds of the tribes had elected to organize under the IRA,
although some did so under heavy pressure from the BIA.32 Since then, many
tribes have amended their IRA constitutions in a variety of ways, for example, by
creating independent judicial systems, by proclaiming constitutional rights of in-
dividuals subject to tribal law, and by removing language giving the BIA unwar-
ranted power. In recent decades, quite a few tribes that have become newly rec-
ognized by the federal government have adopted constitutions under the IRA.
Some tribes govern themselves under other kinds of constitutive documents, and
some exercise self-government according to customary law without a written con-
stitution.

In the 1940s Congress backed away from the policy of the IRA, and in 1953 it
of(cid:222)cially adopted a policy of terminating the federal government(cid:213)s role in Indian
affairs and forcing Indians to become assimilated into the larger society.33 During
this era, Congress unilaterally terminated the federally recognized status of more
than 100 tribes, including several with relatively large reservations and many of the
smallest.34 Quite a few of these tribes have since succeeded in regaining federal
recognition, generally through acts of Congress enacted after long campaigns and
generally with a greatly reduced land base. In addition to statutes that terminated
speci(cid:222)c tribes, during this era Congress also enacted statutes that authorized state
governments to exercise some kinds of jurisdiction within Indian reservations in
certain states.35 In the termination era a variety of social programs were pursued in

56 dean b. suagee

the effort to force Indians to become assimilated, such as the relocation program,
which sought to place Indians in permanent jobs in urban centers away from their
reservations and tribal communities.

3.3 the self-determination era
In the late 1950s, the negative consequences of termination began to become ap-
parent, and Congress gradually moved away from the policy of forced assimila-
tion and back toward support for a measured separatism.36 In the 1960s, Indian
people became more assertive in demanding more control over their communities
along with recognition of their rights to remain culturally distinct. In the 1970s,
Congress enacted a number of statutes that established a framework for tribal
governments  to  become  effective  modern  governments,  including  the  Indian
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (Self-Determination
Act),37 the statute from which the current era takes its name. Under the Self-
Determination Act, Indian tribes have the right to take over programs that would
otherwise be administered for their bene(cid:222)t by the BIA or the Indian Health Ser-
vice (IHS). As tribes have become increasingly involved in contracting with the
BIA and the IHS to run programs, Congress has enacted amendments to this
statute on several occasions, most recently in 1994.38 On many reservations today,
the tribal government is very much in charge, and there are very few employees of
the BIA and the IHS.

During the (cid:222)rst quarter century of the self-determination era, the Supreme
Court decided a number of cases that upheld the authority of tribal governments
over Indian country and limited the authority of the states. These decisions, which
reaf(cid:222)rmed the foundation principles, provided tribes with a measure of assurance
that many needed in taking control of their own destinies by using their powers
of self-government to improve their social and economic conditions(cid:209)managing
natural resources development, selling hunting and (cid:222)shing licenses, taxing eco-
nomic activities, promoting tourism, and operating gaming facilities.39

As tribes have asserted their governmental powers, they have met resistance
from state and local governments and from non-Indians who object to the very
idea that tribal governments should have authority over them. The resistance that
tribes have encountered shows that many people in the American society simply do
not understand, or do not care to understand, the position that tribal governments
occupy in our federal system. As David Getches has shown, in many of the cases
that have reached the Supreme Court in the last two decades, the Court has dis-
regarded the foundation principles and has instead issued decisions based on its
subjective view of what the law ought to be, showing great deference to the inter-
ests of non-Indians.40 The Court(cid:213)s new (cid:210)implicit divestiture(cid:211) rule41 has been a key
factor in most of these decisions.

human rights and cultural heritage 57

3.4 is a human rights analysis relevant?
As we approach the beginning of the twenty-(cid:222)rst century, Indian tribes are deter-
mined to survive as distinct self-governing communities. They carry out this de-
termination in a position of vulnerability. The structure of American federalism
provides no commitment to the permanence of tribal governments as part of that
structure. The American public exhibits a widespread lack of understanding about
the governmental status of Indian tribes and the nature of their rights. If Congress
were to reverse course again and disavow the policy of supporting tribal sover-
eignty, tribal leaders have little reason for believing that the will of the people
would rise up in support of the Indian cause.

Would a human rights analysis be useful in securing the permanence of tribal
governments within American federalism? Would such an analysis be useful in
dealing with current issues relating to the status and rights of tribes, issues that
may be addressed by Congress or the executive branch of the federal government?
For representatives of indigenous peoples elsewhere in the world and of national
governments other than the United States, just how relevant is the experience of
Indian tribes in the United States in the development of international standards
on the rights of indigenous peoples? Before attempting to answer these questions,
indeed, before such questions can be properly framed, we must (cid:222)rst examine the
content of some of the human rights principles that appear to be relevant.

4 the draft united nations declaration on 
the rights of indigenous peoples

This part looks at the Draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights of In-
digenous Peoples (Draft UN Declaration),42 with an emphasis on some of the
provisions that are designed to ensure the survival of indigenous peoples as distinct
cultures.43 This part also offers a critique of some of the ways in which the United
States has called for changes in the Draft UN Declaration.

4.1 development of the draft un declaration
The  development  of standards  under  international  law  to  protect  the  human
rights of indigenous individuals and groups has been unfolding for more than a
quarter century. In 1971 the UN Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrim-
ination and the Protection of Minorities appointed a Special Rapporteur to study
the problem of discrimination against indigenous peoples. In 1977, representatives
of indigenous peoples gathered in Geneva for the International Nongovernmen-
tal Organization Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations
in the Americas. In 1982, the parent body of the human rights organs in the United

58 dean b. suagee

Nations, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), established the Working
Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP). ECOSOC gave the WGIP a two-part
mandate: to review developments affecting indigenous peoples and to develop
standards for protecting the rights of indigenous peoples.

The work product of the standard-setting part of its mandate is the Draft
UN Declaration. In 1993, the WGIP completed its work on the Draft UN Dec-
laration and reported the document on to the next level in the United Nations hi-
erarchy, the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Pro-
tection of Minorities.44 In 1994, the sub-commission approved the Draft UN
Declaration and reported it out to the next level, the Human Rights Commis-
sion.45 In 1995, the commission established its own working group (HRC Working
Group) and established procedures by which indigenous organizations and repre-
sentatives could apply for participation at these meetings.46 The HRC Working
Group meets annually in Geneva.

In her presentation of the Draft UN Declaration to the Sub-Commission in
1994, WGIP Chairperson-Rapporteur Erica-Irene Daes described the substance of
the Draft UN Declaration, including three main elements (cid:210)which distinguish it
from all other human rights instruments.(cid:211)47 She referred to these elements as (cid:210)legal
personality, territorial security, and international responsibility.(cid:211)48 Brie(cid:223)y, by these
concepts Daes means that indigenous peoples must be recognized as (cid:210)peoples,(cid:211)
each of which possesses a collective legal character, that each indigenous people
needs security within its own territory in order to maintain its distinctive identity;
and that, while indigenous peoples generally do not aspire to independent state-
hood, they do seek to live as distinct communities that will never be completely in-
tegrated into the states of the world, and so, to protect the integrity of their rela-
tionships with states, they need access to international legal forums.49

While acknowledging that the text of the Draft UN Declaration no doubt
could be further re(cid:222)ned, Daes advocated its adoption without substantive change
as soon as possible, saying: (cid:210)In many parts of the world, indigenous peoples are
still suffering from physical, ecological and cultural destruction. It is imperative, in
my mind, that the United Nations system as a whole begin to act (cid:222)rmly and for-
mally in the defense of these peoples while they still have hope of survival. The
Draft Declaration would provide the mandate for a concerted United Nations
program in defense of indigenous peoples. I do not see how textual re(cid:222)nements
or other abstract and unjusti(cid:222)ed pretexts could justify delaying such a mandate any
further.(cid:211)50

Despite this admonition, many of the states of the world that have sent del-
egates to the HRC Working Group have shown that they are intent on making
some changes in the wording of the declaration. In the meetings of the HRC
Working Group, the United States has been one of the states that have argued for
changes of a fundamental nature.

human rights and cultural heritage 59

4.2 collective rights and self-determination
The Draft UN Declaration addresses the rights of indigenous individuals and the
collective or group rights of indigenous peoples. Numerous articles in the Draft
UN Declaration expressly speak of collective rights, and other articles use the term
(cid:210)peoples(cid:211) in a way that indicates that a right is collective in nature. Much of the
opposition of the United States has focused on the concept of collective rights.
The United States also has joined with many other states in expressing opposi-
tion to the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination. Article 3 of the
Draft UN Declaration proclaims: (cid:210)Indigenous peoples have the right of self-
determination. By virtue of that right they freely pursue their economic, social,
and cultural development.(cid:211)51

4.2.1 The Opposition of the United States
In one of its (cid:210)Preliminary Statements(cid:211) submitted to the HRC Working Group
in 1995, the United States said: (cid:210)As other delegations have noted, international
instruments generally speak of individual, not collective, rights.(cid:211)52 Although
this is generally true, the generalization ignores the right of all peoples to self-
determination,  a  collective  right  enshrined  in  numerous  international  docu-
ments.53 This, of course, is the collective right that many of the delegations of na-
tional governments now seek to deny indigenous peoples. One way of revising the
Draft UN Declaration so that it does not recognize this right is by deleting the let-
ter (cid:210)s(cid:211) from the term (cid:210)indigenous peoples.(cid:211) Quite a number of states have ex-
pressed support for such a change.

Anticipating opposition of states, the WGIP Chairperson-Rapporteur, Erica-
Irene Daes, spoke concerning this upon delivery of the Draft UN Declaration to
the sub-commission. She asserted that (cid:210)the historical distinction between indige-
nous and other peoples is doomed to join racism, colonialism, and totalitarianism
among the pretexts for inhumanity and greed that our era has struggled to elimi-
nate forever. A compromise on this issue would be as backward-looking a step
today, as a compromise on freedom of speech and dissent a decade ago.(cid:211)54

The United States and others did not respond favorably to Daes(cid:213)s call to
higher ground. The United States initially resisted the use of the term (cid:210)peoples(cid:211)
in the Draft UN Declaration, both because of its implied recognition of collective
rights55 and because of its association with the right to self-determination which
some say carries the right to independent statehood and secession under interna-
tional law.56 In its attempt to legitimize the denial of collective rights for indige-
nous peoples, the United States has said:

Making clear that the rights guaranteed are those of individuals prevents
governments or groups from violating or interfering with them in the name
of the greater good of a group or state.

60 dean b. suagee

Of course, individuals may and often will exercise their rights in

community with others. The United States recognizes that in certain cases,
it may be entirely appropriate or necessary to refer to indigenous
communities or groups, in order to reinforce their individual civil and 
political rights on the basis of full equality and nondiscrimination. But
characterizing a right as belonging to a community, or collective, rather than
an individual, can be and often is construed to limit the exercise of that
right (since only the group can invoke it), and thus may open the door to
the denial of the right to the individual.

This approach is consistent with the general view of the United

States, as developed by its domestic experience, that the rights of
all people are best assured when the rights of each person are effectively
protected.57

This (cid:210)general view of the United States(cid:211) is contradicted by more than two
centuries of U.S. (cid:210)domestic experience(cid:211) in dealing with Indian tribes and nations,
as discussed earlier in this article. From the earliest days of the union, federal law
has recognized collective rights of Indian tribes to continue to exist as distinct,
self-governing  communities.58 If the  history  of federal  Indian  policy  teaches
nothing else, the larger American society should have learned by now that Indian
people insist on continuing to be Indian, and that their sovereign right to self-
governance within a recognized territory is essential to their survival as distinct
cultures.

The United States has a long tradition of recognizing and upholding the
rights of individual citizens. Acknowledging this tradition, however, does not re-
quire policymakers to overlook the fact that the United States also has a long tra-
dition of recognizing the collective rights of Indian tribes to exist. The right of a
tribe to continue to exist is essentially a collective right. If the tribe itself ceases
to exist, the rights that individuals might have had as members of the group no
longer have much meaning. This is a critical point where the United States should
take a leadership role in support of the rights of indigenous peoples.

In its 1996 (cid:210)Preliminary Statements(cid:211) the United States took the position that
the term (cid:210)self-determination(cid:211) is so politically charged that it might prove coun-
terproductive to use it, in that the states of the world may not support the decla-
ration if the term is not removed or quali(cid:222)ed. Following up on this position, in
its 1997 offerings, the United States proposed some speci(cid:222)c language to qualify the
use of the term (cid:210)peoples(cid:211) throughout the declaration.59 The United States pro-
posed revisions that would eliminate the use of the term (cid:210)peoples(cid:211) in some arti-
cles and would qualify it in others by inserting an asterisk in the text of the article,
which would have the effect of making the following language part of the decla-
ration: (cid:210)The use of the term (cid:212)peoples(cid:213) in the declaration has no implications re-

human rights and cultural heritage 61

garding the right of self-determination or any other rights which may attach to the
term under international law.(cid:211)

In other words, the United States has taken the position that it is accept-
able to use the (cid:210)s(cid:211) on the word (cid:210)peoples(cid:211) if we can agree that it does not mean
anything(cid:209)or, more speci(cid:222)cally, if we can agree that indigenous peoples do not
have the right of self-determination.

4.2.2 An Alternative Way To Resolve the Self-Determination Issue
The United States could choose to provide leadership by example and stake out
a position on the moral high ground. As used in international law, the term
(cid:210)self-determination(cid:211) means something more than it does in U.S. domestic law.
In  international  law  the  term  describes  a  principle  that  is  enshrined  in  the
United Nations Charter60 and other international legal instruments.61 For exam-
ple, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights proclaims that
(cid:210)[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they
freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social,
and cultural development.(cid:211)62

Although self-determination is widely acknowledged to be a (cid:210)principle of the
highest order within the contemporary international system,(cid:211)63 no consensus exists
on what it means or on which groups are entitled to exercise it, that is, which
groups are (cid:210)peoples.(cid:211) As described by James Anaya, self-determination is (cid:210)a uni-
verse of human rights precepts concerned broadly with peoples, including indige-
nous peoples, and grounded in the idea that all are equally entitled to control their
own destinies.(cid:211)64

Many of the national governments of the world have resisted the recognition
of a human rights norm explicitly stating that indigenous peoples have the right to
self-determination, especially if self-determination is understood to include the
right to become an independent country. As Anaya has explained, however, the
right of self-determination does not necessarily include the right to become an in-
dependent country.65 As he sees it, self-determination has both substantive as-
pects and remedial aspects, and the substantive aspects can be further broken down
into two component parts: (cid:210)First, in what may be called its constitutive aspect, self-
determination requires that the governing institutional order be substantially the
creation of processes guided by the will of the people, or peoples, governed. Sec-
ond, in what may be called its ongoing aspect, self-determination requires that the
governing institutional order, independently of the processes leading to its cre-
ation or alteration, be one under which people may live and develop freely on a
continuous basis.(cid:211)66

When a people has been deprived of the substantive aspects of self-deter-
mination, that gives rise to the need for a remedy. In the context of decolonization,
the remedy provided by the international community generally has included the

62 dean b. suagee

right to become an independent country, but this may not be the most appropri-
ate remedy in the context of indigenous peoples. Rather, in the context of indige-
nous peoples, a people might choose from a variety of arrangements other than in-
dependent statehood and, if the ongoing aspects of the arrangement work, that
would be meaningful self-determination. There may well be cases in which inde-
pendent statehood would be an appropriate remedy, but it is not a generally avail-
able right.67 It would be more productive for the states of the world to focus on the
substantive aspects of self-determination for indigenous peoples than to try to
stop the discussion by raising their fear of secession.68

4.2.3 Derogation of the Rights of Individuals
In its campaign to weaken the Draft UN Declaration, the United States has used
the argument that recognition of rights in a collective entity results in the deroga-
tion of rights of individual members of the collective entity. As quoted earlier, in
its (cid:210)Preliminary Statement(cid:211) on article 1 of the Draft UN Declaration, the United
States said that (cid:210)characterizing a right as belonging to a community, or collective,
rather than an individual, can be and often is construed to limit the exercise of that
right (since only the group can invoke it), and thus may open the door to the de-
nial of the right to the individual.(cid:211)69

Is this preemptive strike against possible abuses of collective rights really nec-
essary? Article 33 of the Draft UN Declaration already provides that, in exercising
their rights to (cid:210)promote, develop and maintain their institutional structures and
their distinctive juridical customs, traditions, procedures and practices,(cid:211) indigenous
peoples must do so (cid:210)in accordance with internationally recognized human rights standards.(cid:211)70
If there are other speci(cid:222)c points in the Draft UN Declaration that raise concerns
regarding potential abuse, states could suggest appropriate qualifying language
rather than mount a broadside attack on the concept of collective human rights.

4.3 the right to cultural integrity
Every ethnic or cultural group has a right to exist. This is the necessary implication
of several human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.71 Anaya has referred to the basic prin-
ciple as the norm of (cid:210)cultural integrity.(cid:211)72 This norm is also re(cid:223)ected in article 27
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights73 and the UN Decla-
ration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious, and
Linguistic Minorities.74 This human rights norm only makes sense as a collective
right. An individual cannot be a part of a group if the group no longer exists. The
Draft UN Declaration re(cid:223)ects this principle in several of its articles.

4.3.1 Cultural Heritage in the Draft UN Declaration
While the Draft UN Declaration does not expressly endorse the right to cultural
integrity, it does include a number of articles that would give effect to the right

human rights and cultural heritage 63

of indigenous peoples to live as distinct cultures. In particular, articles 12, 13, 14
(which together comprise part III of the declaration), 25, and 29 address particu-
lar aspects of indigenous cultural heritage. Since the entire text of the Draft UN
Declaration is reprinted in this issue of the International Journal of Cultural Property,
these articles are not reproduced here.

Brie(cid:223)y, article 12 speaks of an indigenous people(cid:213)s right to practice cultural
traditions, including physical manifestations such as historic and archaeological
sites and cultural, intellectual, religious, and spiritual property. Article 13 speaks
of the right to practice and teach their religious traditions, including the right of
access to sacred places and the right to the repatriation of human remains. Arti-
cle 14 speaks of the right to revitalize, use, and transmit to future generations their
histories, languages, and oral traditions. Article 25 speaks of the right to maintain
their distinctive spiritual and material relationship with the lands and waters of
their homelands. Article 29 recognizes the right to the ownership, control, and
protection of their cultural and intellectual property.

These articles convey a sense of understanding and appreciation of the many
ways in which the cultures of indigenous peoples in general, and Indian tribes in
particular, are connected to the natural world. Tribal cultural knowledge, practices,
and values exist in this context. It makes little sense to speak of rights to carry on
these aspects of culture except in the context of connectedness to the natural
world.

4.3.2 Critique of U.S. Proposed Revisions
In the 1997 session of the HRC Working Group, the United States proposed to
rewrite substantially these and other articles dealing with cultural heritage so that
the rights proclaimed would be individual in nature rather than collective.75 In sup-
port of these suggested revisions, the United States offered a few sentences for
each Article, explanatory comments that struck me, as an Indian lawyer with some
background in the subject matter, as embarrassingly uninformed. A few examples
may serve to support this observation.

In article 12, the United States would replace the sentence stating, (cid:210)Indigenous
peoples have the right to practice and revitalize their cultural traditions and cus-
toms,(cid:211) with a statement about not denying indigenous individuals the right to
(cid:210)enjoy their own culture.(cid:211) In article 13, the United States would replace the collec-
tive right of indigenous peoples to (cid:210)practice, develop, and teach their spiritual and
religious traditions, customs, and ceremonies(cid:211) with the individual right to (cid:210)free-
dom of thought, conscience, and religion,(cid:211) including the right to (cid:210)adopt a religion
or belief of his or her own choice.(cid:211) The United States says that these changes are
based on articles 27 and 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, respectively. In the context of article 13 of the Draft UN Declaration, the
United States says that its proposed revisions (cid:210)are intended to harmonize the draft
declaration with existing international law.(cid:211)76 In its comment on article 14, the

64 dean b. suagee

United States says, (cid:210)The fundamental goal of preserving indigenous history, lan-
guage, and tradition can best be achieved by protecting the right of individuals to
take the necessary steps by themselves and in community with others (such as
tribes, associations, groups, etc.).(cid:211)77

The emphasis of the United States on the rights of individuals misses the
point. Articles 12, 13, and 14 are needed because indigenous cultures are threatened
(cid:209)their very existence is at risk. Carrying on traditional tribal religions is more
than the freedom to choose, more than the right to (cid:210)enjoy(cid:211) one(cid:213)s culture. As the
U.S. Congress recognized in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978,
(cid:210)the religious practices of the American Indian (as well as Native Alaskan and
Hawaiian) are an integral part of their culture, tradition, and heritage, such prac-
tices forming the basis of Indian identity and value systems.(cid:211)78 The culture and re-
ligion must be passed down through the generations or the culture and religion
cannot survive, and this means that some people in each generation are obligated
to perform certain roles. The survival of indigenous cultures and religions requires
more than the freedom of individuals to choose to believe; it also requires some in-
dividuals to act out of responsibility to their cultures, their peoples. If some peo-
ple do not accept responsibility for carrying on the culture and religion, others will
not have the freedom to choose the tribal religion because it will no longer exist.
For certain individuals in the State Department to make purportedly factual
statements on behalf of the United States of America regarding the (cid:210)best(cid:211) way
of (cid:210)preserving indigenous history, language, and tradition(cid:211) without meaningful
consultation79 with the individual members of Indian tribes who have dedicated
their lives to preserving indigenous histories, languages, and traditions is, at best,
condescending. Less charitably, this statement by the State Department could be
described as misleading, in that it presents as fact a point on which reasonable,
well-informed people could disagree. The apparent intent of the statement is to
convey the impression that representatives of U.S. tribes have been consulted and
are in agreement.

Another statement that is at best misleading can be found in the U.S. com-
ment on article 13. This comment says in part, (cid:210)The rights at issue are fully pro-
tected as individual rights that can be exercised in community with others.(cid:211) The
rights at issue, as stated in the language that the United States proposes to strike,
include (cid:210)the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious
and cultural sites.(cid:211) It would be more accurate for the State Department to ac-
knowledge that, under U.S. constitutional law, the freedom of religion protected
by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment does not prevent the federal
government from carrying out activities on federal lands that would (cid:210)virtually de-
stroy(cid:211) a tribal religion.80 If the protection of the religious freedom of Indians as
individuals under the U.S. Constitution allows for the virtual destruction of the
tribal religion, how can this be described as full protection?

human rights and cultural heritage 65

Yet another example of a misleading statement by the State Department can
be found in the U.S. comment on article 29, which concerns intellectual property.
The U.S. statement on its suggested changes to this article says: (cid:210)Many States have
very developed intellectual property laws which provide signi(cid:222)cant protections for
indigenous property interests. The U.S. agrees that States must accord indigenous
individuals the same rights as other citizens to utilize these national systems for
protection of their own intellectual and cultural property. States, however, must re-
tain the authority to determine whether and under what circumstances additional
protections should be accorded to indigenous property interests.(cid:211)

The U.S. comment simply overlooks a substantial body of literature that
demonstrates that the existing legal regimes for the protection of intellectual
property just do not work very well for many of the kinds of interests for which
indigenous peoples seek protection. This literature includes numerous works
produced under the auspices of the UN Sub-Commission on the Protection of
Minorities and the Prevention of Discrimination.81 A basic reason for the in-
adequacy of the existing legal regimes is that the knowledge for which indige-
nous peoples seek protection is the communal knowledge that has been handed
down through the generations. Intellectual property law protects the creative
works of individuals for a limited period of time. Thus, while traditional cul-
tural knowledge is similar to intellectual property, many people who have stud-
ied this subject, including Daes, have concluded that intellectual property law
does not work very well and that some other form of legal protection needs to
be developed.82

For some reason, the U.S. comment ignores this literature, and the United
States proposes to rewrite the article so that it only speaks of intellectual prop-
erty and not of cultural property. Ignoring this body of literature cannot be at-
tributed to simple ignorance on the part of the State Department.83

If the United States is serious in its expression of support for the adoption
of a strong UN Declaration, it needs to (cid:222)nd a way to transcend its objections
to the concept of collective human rights. One logical way would be to embrace
the norm of cultural integrity as a collective right in existing human rights law,
and to recognize that the collective rights standards in the Draft UN Declara-
tion have been determined to be necessary to effectuate the right to cultural in-
tegrity for indigenous peoples. Some of the articles in the declaration might then
be revised to clarify that the exercise of collective rights must be done in ways
that are consistent with the existing human rights law protecting the rights of in-
dividuals.

The United States could take a step toward developing an appreciation for the
need for some collective rights by seriously engaging in consultation with tribes in
the formulation of positions to be presented in the international arena. Through
serious consultation, federal of(cid:222)cials might learn to understand what tribal repre-

66 dean b. suagee

sentatives mean when they speak of the responsibilities of individuals to their
communities and their responsibilities for the natural world. The federal of(cid:222)cials
who represent the United States in Geneva84 might come to understand that tra-
ditional ecological and cultural knowledge tends to be the collective knowledge of
the community.

5 the proposed american declaration on 
the rights of indigenous peoples

In 1989, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS)
commenced the process of developing an inter-American declaration on the rights
of indigenous peoples by adopting a resolution requesting the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to prepare a draft of such an instru-
ment.85 In September 1995, the IACHR approved a draft Inter-American Declara-
tion on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,86 which was then circulated to member
states, indigenous entities, and other interested organizations for comment. The
United States submitted written comments urging that much of the draft text be
substantially rewritten, recommending changes along the lines of those that the
United States has advocated in the context of the Draft UN Declaration, but the
IACHR rejected most of what the United States had to say.87 In February 1997,
the IACHR approved a revised draft, now captioned the American Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (hereinafter Proposed American Declaration),88
and submitted the instrument to the OAS General Assembly to be considered for
adoption.

5.1 overview
The Proposed American Declaration contains many provisions that are similar to
provisions in the Draft UN Declaration, although there are also some signi(cid:222)cant
differences. While a detailed comparison of the two instruments is beyond the
scope of this article, a few observations are offered. Since the structures of the two
instruments are not parallel, anyone who seeks to undertake a detailed comparison
of the two must (cid:222)rst become familiar with the structure of each.

The Proposed American Declaration contains twenty-seven articles, which
are grouped into six sections, and each article and each section has a caption. In
addition, there are (cid:222)fteen preambular clauses that are grouped under nine head-
ings. The captions of the (cid:222)ve sections of the declaration are: Indigenous Peoples;
Human Rights; Cultural Development; Organizational and Political Rights; and
Social, Economic, and Property Rights. In comparison, the Draft UN Declara-
tion is comprised of eighteen preambular clauses and forty-(cid:222)ve articles; the arti-
cles are grouped into nine parts, and neither the articles nor the parts have been
given captions.

human rights and cultural heritage 67

5.2 self-government and collective rights
In contrast to the Draft UN Declaration, the Proposed American Declaration does
not expressly proclaim that indigenous peoples have the right of self-determination.
Rather, article 1 states that the use of the term (cid:210)peoples(cid:211) is (cid:210)not to be construed
as having any implication with respect to any other rights that might be attached
to that term in international law.(cid:211)89 Article 15 of the Proposed American Declara-
tion, however, does proclaim that indigenous peoples have (cid:210)the right to freely de-
termine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, spiritual, and
cultural development,(cid:211)90 and article 16 proclaims that indigenous peoples have the
right to govern their communities in accordance with their own legal systems.91
These provisions in the Proposed American Declaration correspond to, and are
generally consistent with, articles 31 and 33 in the Draft UN Declaration.

Article 2 of the Proposed American Declaration expressly states, (cid:210)Indigenous
peoples have the collective rights that are indispensable to the enjoyment of the in-
dividual rights of their members.(cid:211)92 In addition, article 4 provides that (cid:210)[i]ndige-
nous peoples have the right to have their legal personality fully recognized by the
states within their legal systems.(cid:211)93 These two provisions, along with others, make
it clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is convinced that
the af(cid:222)rmation of the collective rights of indigenous peoples is essential both for
the survival of indigenous peoples as distinct cultures and for the ability of in-
digenous individuals to exercise their rights as members of indigenous cultures.

5.3 cultural heritage
Section 3 of the Proposed American Declaration, captioned (cid:210)Cultural Develop-
ment,(cid:211) contains most of the provisions relating to cultural heritage. This section
consists of seven articles, 7 through 13, which are captioned: Right to Cultural In-
tegrity; Philosophy, Outlook and Language; Education; Spiritual and Religious
Freedom; Family Relations and Family Ties; Health and Well-Being; and Right to
Environmental Protection. Many of the provisions in these articles have counter-
parts in the Draft UN Declaration.

Signi(cid:222)cantly,  article  7  expressly  af(cid:222)rms  that  indigenous  peoples  have  the
(cid:210)right to their cultural integrity.(cid:211)94 As discussed earlier in this paper, the Draft UN
Declaration contains several provisions that can be described as af(cid:222)rming such a
right but does not expressly use the term (cid:210)right to cultural integrity.(cid:211)

Article 13 contains seven paragraphs articulating a right to environmental pro-
tection, including such rights as  (cid:210)the right to participate fully in formulating,
planning, managing, and applying governmental programmes of conservation to
their lands, territories, and resources.(cid:211)95 The decision to place this article within
the section of the declaration addressing cultural development re(cid:223)ects the impor-
tance of the natural world for the survival of indigenous cultures and the cultural
values that indigenous peoples hold regarding their relationships with the natural
world.

68 dean b. suagee

In the (cid:222)eld of environmental protection, U.S. domestic law can serve as an ex-
ample for other countries, including those of the OAS. In the United States, en-
vironmental protection is carried out in a federalist partnership between the na-
tional government and the states. Most of the major federal environmental statutes
authorize tribal governments to perform tasks like those carried out by state gov-
ernment, such as setting water quality standards under the Clean Water Act.96 This
is generally consistent with the foundation principles of federal Indian law: the
plenary power of Congress has been used to support the right of tribal self-
government and to prevent intrusions by state governments that would interfere
with the exercise of tribal sovereignty. For the purposes of this article, it should be
noted  that  when  tribes  administer  environmental  regulatory  programs  in  the
framework of these federal laws, they have many opportunities to incorporate cul-
tural knowledge and values into their programs.97

conclusion

Indigenous cultures need their connections to particular parts of the natural world
and the communities of other living things that make up the web of life. Indian
people as individuals might have survived if the eagles had been driven into ex-
tinction, but a core aspect of tribal cultures would be missing if there were no
eagle feathers for religious ceremonies. The tribes of the Paci(cid:222)c Northwest need
the wild salmon to recover not just enough to be safe from the threat of extinction,
but enough to be a central part of tribal life. The tribes of the Great Plains need
the great herds of buffalo.

This article raised the question of whether a human rights analysis is relevant
to the situation of Indian tribes in the United States. In my view, such an analy-
sis might be helpful in at least three basic ways: building the base of support in the
dominant American society for a long-term commitment to the principle of tribal
self-governance, which, as we should know from the U.S. experience, is essential
for cultural survival; providing a framework for de(cid:222)ning limits on the power of the
federal government over the tribes, limits that should be consistent with the prin-
ciples of tribal self-determination and cultural integrity98; and providing a foun-
dation for de(cid:222)ning limits on the sovereign powers of tribal governments in their
dealings with individuals, including nonmembers, limits that may be acceptable to
tribal of(cid:222)cials because they are based on international human rights law rather
than on the national law of the United States.

This  article  has  offered  a  critique  of some  of the  positions  taken  by  the
United States in the international arena relating to the human rights of indigenous
peoples. Indigenous peoples in many other countries do not have rights like those
recognized under U.S. law. In many countries, survival for indigenous peoples is a

human rights and cultural heritage 69

daily struggle, and genocide is not an abstract concept. The United States can help
to change this by putting a stop to its efforts to weaken the Draft UN Declaration
and by working for its adoption.

Will the United States live up to its self-image and provide real human rights
leadership for the rest of the world? In my view, the United States has failed to
provide leadership, but it could begin to rectify this failure by adopting the po-
sitions outlined in this article on the issues of self-determination and collective
human rights. In the emerging international law of the human rights of indige-
nous peoples, the moral high ground includes endorsing the basic idea of col-
lective human rights, recognizing that indigenous peoples have the right of self-
determination,  and  using  the  term  (cid:210)peoples(cid:211) without  hesitancy  or  qualifying
language.

reservation boundaries and now exercise governmental jurisdiction over those lands, it would
be completely unrealistic to suggest that tribes in the United States will ever regain the full ex-
tent of their aboriginal territories.

84. From personal experience I know that quite a few of the people in the federal government
who have been involved with the Draft UN Declaration do have an appreciation for traditional
ecological and cultural knowledge as something that is collective in nature, particularly people
in the Department of the Interior and Department of Justice. In my view, the State Depart-
ment should show greater deference to those in other departments who have more expertise
in federal Indian law and policy. Unfortunately, at the November 1998 session of the HRC
Working Group, the State Department submitted a written statement that had not even been
submitted to the Department of the Interior or the Department of Justice for review. General
