Cultural heritage management is an inherently retrospective discipline. To the detriment
of future heritage management, some heritage places were not recognised and managed
even though they had instant global significance after their creation (e.g. sites of the Apollo
space programme). The current revolution in robotic technologies, coupled with the devel-
opments in artificial intelligence, suggests that the creation of self-reflective robots capable
of  semi-independent  thought  (processes)  is  not  too  far  away.  This  paper  explores  the
conceptual and ethical issues that heritage managers face when dealing with the heritage
such robots will create.

Heritage

The aim of this paper is to generate some reflection on and discussion of the future of
our  heritage.  This  paper  will  not  cover  familiar  ground  by  looking  at  the  abundant
literature on the agents and processes that influence the future of our heritage, be they
political,1 administrative,2 economic,3 social or environmental.4 The focus of the paper
rests in the conceptual realm of heritage futures.

By its nature, cultural heritage management (in the USA, ‘historic preservation’) is a
discipline that is intensely retrospective. Indeed, the heritage laws of some countries
require that a certain time has elapsed before a property may be deemed eligible for
inclusion  in  heritage  lists.  The  US  Historic  Preservation  Act  with  its  50-year  rule
springs to mind (but is not the only one) where the justifications for exceptions to this
rule are very complicated.5 While in the USA the debate has commenced on finding
ways to recognise late 20th-century heritage under the existing framework,6 these legal
provisions  have  prevented  the  heritage  value  of  sites  associated  with  the  Apollo
programme being formally recognised the moment Neil Armstrong stepped onto the
lunar surface—even though the significance of the event for humanity as a whole was
indisputable.7 As a result, quite a number of sites and items were lost because formal
assessment was not carried out.8

There is substantial potential for the loss of emergent heritage(s), especially in the area
of technologies. Examples range from decommissioned as well as still operating nuclear
power plants to laboratories and installations, where ground breaking research has been
carried  out,  such  as  the  Human  Genome  DNA  laboratory  at  Lawrence  Livermore
National Laboratory in Livermore (CA, USA) or the much more imposing CERN facility
near  Meyrin  (Switzerland)  and  other  superconductor  establishments.  While  some
thought has been given to the management of technological facilities that are still in use
today and form industrial and ongoing technological investment9 the issue of recogn-
ising emergent heritage has not seen enough attention from heritage managers.

If future heritage potential is not to be lost, then a paradigm shift is required that
challenges the retrospective nature of cultural heritage management and the concom-
itant mindset of many of its practitioners—well trained, yet moulded into a confined
outlook on heritage through their education as archaeologists or architects,10 as well as
through  exposure  to  daily  commercial  pressures.  Rather  than  relying  solely  on
retrospective evaluation, responsible ‘stewardship’11 entails that heritage practitioners
are also cognisant of contemporary and emerging issues. To the physical manifesta-
tions of these issues (in the form of sites, buildings or landscapes) the precautionary
principle needs to be applied.12 There is no logical reason why protective listing cannot
and should not occur for very recent heritage. Under the Australian legal framework
this is certainly possible as the following two examples will illustrate.

The first example is the Broadarrow Café at Port Arthur, Tasmania, where on 29
April  1996  a  single  gunman  shot  35  and  killed  20  people  (with  another  15  killed
elsewhere in the grounds of the Port Arthur historic site). While the café was to be
demolished once it was no longer needed as a crime scene, heritage practitioners soon
after argued that this site, albeit imbued with dissonant heritage values, encapsulated a
fundamental  change  in  Australian  society,  leading  to  the  banning  of  handguns  and
automatic  weapons  across  the  nation.13  The  social  significance  of  these  events  was
immediately  recognisable  and  did  not  require  the  passage  of  time.  Hence,  heritage
protection of the site was warranted and justified.14

The second example is the lecture theatre and administrative buildings of Charles
Sturt University’s Thurgoona (New South Wales) campus. Erected in 1997–2001 using
rammed earth technology, the buildings and the landscaping in which they are set are
as environmentally neutral as possible, relying on passive energy, with solar heating
and water cooling (piped through large farm dams acting as heat exchangers), as well
as composting toilets and artificial wetlands for purification of human waste.15 Even
though the buildings are very recent, they have been the stimulus for a more wide-
spread application of the design and technology in the region, including application in
schools,  churches  and  private  dwellings.  For  this  reason  the  lecture  theatre  and
administrative  buildings  have  been  included  as  worthy  of  protection  in  the  recent
Albury City Heritage Study16 and are poised to be included in the local legal protection
framework to be finalised in late 2006.

Given the mutability of heritage values, a proper application of the precautionary
principle does not mean that decisions made today need to be permanent. Rather, they
provide a future generation of heritage professionals with options they otherwise may

lack. If it becomes clear, with the passage of time and a reassessment of the values, that
the initial assumptions about the future values of the listed sites were over-optimistic,
the site can be delisted.17

This kind of proactive thinking and the actions derived from it have already been
applied to some future developments. A good number of spacecraft circle the Earth in
stable  or  geostationary  orbits.  Calls  have  been  made  to  maintain  some  of  these  for
future heritage managers to classify, evaluate and manage.18 As human exploration of
the universe moves on to other planets, the spectre of cultural landscapes created on
other planets has raised its head among the conservation movement and ethicists. Mars
appears to be the next celestial body to be explored by human endeavour—although a
return to the Moon will occur in the more immediate future.19 A debate on the ethics
of ‘terra-forming’ or the creation of Earth-like, and thus human-inhabitable, environ-
ments  on  Mars  has  started,  with  some  scholars  advocating  that  an  (inter-)national
parks system should be established on Mars in order to protect some areas from human
interference.20

Although some of the issues and subject matter is that of present and future heritage,
and even though the concept of terra-forming Mars sounds quite futuristic to many,
all examples are mere extensions of the present concepts. Indeed, practicalities of access
and  law  enforcement  aside,  all  issues  can  be  dealt  with  using  existing  paradigms.
Common to the above considerations of contemporary, emergent and future heritage
is  the  fact  that  heritage  is  still  constructed  as  the  processes  and  products  of  human
interaction  with  the  environment  surrounding  us,  which,  over  time,  has  already
become a human artefact in its own right: a cultural landscape.21

This  paper  wishes  to  expand  this  discourse  and  consider  the  nature  of  heritage
created not by humans but by machines. What is the nature and future of the Earth’s
robotic heritage?

The predictable response to the question will be one of disbelief. Why, then, in the
face of possible ridicule should one pursue such a topic?22 The author believes that the
matter of robotic heritage will be a major issue faced by the next generation of heritage
managers. These are not questions of an idle academic mind. As will be shown below,
artificial intelligence, unbeknownst to most users, has already become quite pervasive
in modern society and robotic appliances are entering the consumer market in a series
of guises.23 We have to consider the heritage dimensions now, while we still have a
chance to develop appropriate mechanisms and protocols.

Robots and Robotics

A couple of definitions are needed to set the scene. A robot, as defined by practical
English  usage,  is  a  machine  or  device  that  performs  tasks  subject  to  direct  human,
programmed controls with human interaction and supervision, or completely auton-
omously based on programmed routines. Robotics is the science or study of the tech-
nology associated with the design, fabrication, theory, and application of robots.24

Both  academic  and  popular  (science  fiction)  writing  quickly  took  to  the  term
robotics, coined by Isaac Asimov in 1941 in the short story ‘Liar!’25 Asimov created a

International Journal of Heritage Studies

world where robots were capable of independent rational thought although tied and
subservient  to  humanity  through  a  set  of  behavioural  rules  (Asimov’s  three  laws  of
robotics).26

While  his  concepts  still  remain  fictional,  recent  advances  in  the  field  of  remote-
controlled  technology  and  robotics  have  been  phenomenal.  While  manufacturing
robots have been employed in the automotive industry since the early 1980s,27 mobile
units  have  been  more  recent.  They  have  become  increasingly  advanced  in  their
capabilities, while at the same time simple models, such as Sony’s robotic dog AIBO,
and Sony’s robotic biped SDR-3x have entered the consumer and toy market.28 Honda
has been developing the humanoid robot ASIMO,29 which is capable of stepping down
stairs and navigating predefined environments. It has been deployed as a tour guide in
museums as well as a greeter in, for example, trade fairs.
(Source: Honda.)Likewise,  remote-controlled  equipment,  such  as  satellites,  cruise  missiles,  bomb
removal and deep-sea submersibles have been around for some time, but advances in
computing power have seen their capabilities increase exponentially.30 The RoboCup,
where programmed full-size robots play soccer, is an example of advanced technology
in  which  individual  robots  make  situational  decisions.31  All  these  technologies,
however,  are  still  based  on  programmed  decision  trees  and  activity  sequences.  In  a
sense, all of these examples are machines that operate independently, but under direct
human guidance or through indirect, programmed human coordination.

Figure 1 Honda’s ASIMO humanoid robot.

Early attempts were made to develop routines that could, with some ‘freedom of
choice’,  develop  interactive  chess  programs  and  other  situational  video  games.32
Although these initial attempts were quite restricted in their options, since then new
developments  in  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  have  seen  the  gradual  development  of
computing algorithms that can out-think grandmasters at the game of chess, analyse
and create music and art, develop and self-learn construction rules, develop new car
body shapes, influence transportation systems or design aircraft parts. AI can be used
to equip machines with independent decision-making capabilities based on predefined
grammatical  (rather  than  fixed)  rule  sets,  obviating  the  need  for  the  presence  of
humans. Not surprisingly, military applications have been at the forefront: uncrewed
combat vehicles and surveillance planes have been developed and deployed and are
continually being given increased capabilities.33

In  addition,  experiments  have  been  made  to  introduce  robots  into  the  (human)
rehabilitation environments as well as socio-bots,34 suggesting that a wave of socially
useful robotic applications is not too far off.

At present, none of the robots are included in national lists of cultural heritage items
protected  from  export  or  destruction.  Some  scholarly  research  on  the  matter  has
commenced, at least in the realm of computers, as is evidenced by the journals IEEE
Annals of the History of Computing as well as Iterations: A Journal of Software History
and  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Charles  Babbage  Institute  at  the  University  of
Minnesota. Science and technology museums have been collecting examples of such
equipment as part of their mission. There are also some Web archives that focus on
historic software.35 It is not that part of cultural heritage, however, that is the focus of
the remainder of this paper, but the artefacts and places created or modified by robots.

Places Created by Robots

The  stimulus  for  this  paper  arose  out  of  an  assessment  of  the  management  options
related to the cultural heritage places and items on the lunar surface.36 While these
papers dealt with the traces left by humans, the issue of the management of traces left
by remote-controlled and robotic probes arose. Let us look at the issues at hand.

If we ignore point-sample collection devices such as Luna 9 or Surveyor 3, the first
mobile remote-controlled technology was used in space on 17 November 1970 with the
deployment  of  Luna  17,  a  Soviet  space  probe  that  soft-landed  on  the  moon  and
deployed Lunokhod 1, an eight-wheeled rover. The rover took soil samples and analy-
sed them in situ. During its operational life of 10 days the rover travelled 10.5 km. A
similar device, Lunokhod 2, was deployed in January 1973. This rover lasted for about
four months and travelled over 37 km. The base units of the lunar probes as well as the
base units of the lunar rovers are still on the surface of the moon. There are also the
tracks made by the rover as well as the small depressions caused when the samples were
dug.37

Lunar heritage sites differ from any other heritage site on Earth (or Mars for that
matter) in that, due to the virtual absence of an atmosphere and thus of any winds on
the Moon, the tracks left by Lunokhod 1 and 2 as well as the footprints of the Apollo
astronauts are preserved.

Similarly, remote-controlled rovers have been successfully landed on the Martian
surface. Like the Soviet lunar mission, the US probes collect and analyse soil samples

on the spot without the need to return to Earth. In July 1997 a US space probe soft-
landed and deployed the six-wheeled rover Pathfinder, which operated for almost three
months  and  travelled  less  than  ten  metres  from  the  lander.  In  December  2003  and
January 2004 two new US space probes soft-landed, deploying the six-wheeled rovers
Spirit in 2003 and Opportunity38 in 2004. At the time this paper went to press (in late
2006) both are still operating, both well past their anticipated working life. Spirit has so
far operated for 994 sols and Opportunity for 930 sols,39 travelling 6,876 m and 9,023m,
respectively.40 A British-designed Martian rover failed to respond after landing.41

The US rovers left wheel tracks on the Martian surface that have been photographed
using  the  onboard  camera.  By  dragging  its  wheel,  one  of  the  rovers  (Opportunity)
excavated a small trench in the soft Martian sediment, 50 cm long, 20 cm wide and
about 9 cm deep.42 The trench was dug for sediment extraction at lower levels. These
traces will be obliterated over time because, unlike the Moon, Mars has an atmosphere,
where winds, and indeed storms, are known to occur. Thus it is certain that any tracks
will be eroded in the near to mid-term future. Moreover, it is possible that an entire
rover could be covered in Aeolian sediment.

However, at least on the lunar surface, such traces remain and are poised to be so for
the foreseeable future. The only risks to their survival are human visitation to the sites
and thus obliteration of the tracks by footprints43 and the chance that a micro-meteor
strikes  the  exact  location  and  obliterates  the  track  by  cratering.  Of  those,  human
visitation has the highest probability and thus poses the greatest risk.

Robotic Heritage?

No one would consider discussing whether a hole dug by a front-end loader is a human
activity even though the hole was not dug by human hands or through the exertion of

human power. There is a direct causal relationship between a person manipulating the
levers of the machine and the operation of the bucket of the front-end loader. Likewise,
equipment that is continually controlled in its movements and actions by humans via
electronic signals can be deemed to have been moved and operated by people, however
far the controller’s physical location may be removed from that of the equipment. It is
immaterial in such cases whether a human is actually close to the location of activity.
Conceptually the evidence of such equipment activities is akin to the hole dug by the
front-end loader.

However, as computing technology improves, the capability of machines to make
decisions  independent  of  direct  human  interaction  is  increasing.  The  field  of  AI  is
improving  based  on  co-evolutionary  learning  in  the  self-organization  of  complex
systems.44 This is bound to increase exponentially the capabilities to make decisions
independent of interaction. There are already examples where computing algorithms
have developed new algorithms without human interaction.45

Thus the date is not too far off when we will see physical impact traces and artefacts
of  semi-remotely  controlled,  semi-independent  robots,  ‘thinking’  and  acting  within
broadly defined parameters of permissibility. Matters can quickly become even more
complex as we imagine human-designed and human-programmed robots assembling
a computer algorithm-designed satellite or interplanetary probe in a totally dust-free
environment. It will be loaded by a human-conceptualised but computer-algorithm
designed and part-human, part AI-programmed robot into the cargo-bay of a delivery
vehicle.  After  having  been  safely  deposited  on  a  planetary  surface  by  human-pre-
programmed, but independently acting, decision-making system guiding the approach
and  landing  phases,  the  probe  will  deploy  a  part-human,  part  AI-designed  and
programmed rover, which would then survey the planetary surface based on its AI-
derived  decisions  for  best  effect.  While  this  may,  at  present,  sound  reminiscent  of
George Lucas’s Star Wars, much, if not most, of the technology is actually in place or
under development. Thus such a scenario is quite real.

The previous scenario poses the ethical question of whether the physical traces left
by such remote vehicles on the lunar surface and, should they survive, on the Martian
surface,  constitute  evidence  of  human  interaction  with  the  environment,  and  thus
human cultural heritage. Or are they, in fact, a new type of heritage, partly human,
partly machine? In short, does the old concept of a human-generated heritage suffice,
or do we need to develop a new value system for robotic heritage? And if we do, what
would it look like?

Hoeing Old Ground

Before we can consider the question of a value system for robotic heritage, we need to
reflect  on  and  consider,  albeit  briefly,  the  relevant  conceptual  underpinnings  that
govern cultural heritage management practice on our own planet.

In a broad conceptual framing, cultural heritage is the result of humankind’s inter-
actions  with  the  environment  and  one  another.  The  outcome  of  these  processes  is
reflected  in  a  number  of  forms  and  is  generally  divided  within  two  typologies  of

12 D. H. R. Spennemann

tangible  (built  environment,  sites,  landscapes,  objects  and  artefacts)  and  intangible
cultural heritage (language, folklore, skills and customs).46 The community, from local
to international, ascribes values of varied strength and importance to these expressions
of  cultural  heritage.  Heritage  managers  assess  the  values  projected  onto  cultural
heritage  places  by  the  public  against  predetermined  criteria  to  determine  their
significance.47 Preservation theory holds that this process enables important aspects of
the past to be identified, protected and managed for the benefit of present and future
generations.48

The discussion of heritage values has seen the move from the purely historical and
architectural layers of cultural significance to an increased appreciation of the fact that
social and community values underpin all heritage.49

Since cultural heritage and ‘value’ in general are a human construct, the values that
underpin  and  circumscribe  what  people  define  as  heritage  are  purely  human
projections onto an essentially value-free animate or inanimate world.

Subjective  valuation,  revaluation  and  ultimately  prioritisation  occur  consciously
and subconsciously on a continual basis. If a choice has to be made, individuals tend to
be  prepared  to  ‘trade-off’  one  value  against  another.  Just  as  an  individual’s  values
underpin the personal value assessment, the congruence of individual values creates
values held by communities. As with all values, cultural heritage values are variable
between  communities  as  well  as  socio-economic  layers  within  a  community.
Moreover, values as mutable qualities change in intensity of conviction over time, and
thereby create a semi-fluid state in heritage valuations. These decisions will change with
individual circumstances.50 This fluidity of projected values, both on an individual and
a collective level, with continuously shifting ground rules, needs to be acknowledged.51
The central figure in the valuations is the individual, and the central generation is the
present one. As has been argued elsewhere, ‘we are preserving the past according to our
present values and essentially for our own benefit, and that, plainly speaking, we are
shaping the past in the image of our values’.52

As humanity’s values change in response to the new intellectual challenges posed by
the increased capabilities of AI-derived robots, we need to adjust our perceptions of
‘heritage’.  Ultimately,  we  need  to  consider  that  our  present  definition  of  cultural
heritage needs to be flexible enough to include the actions of human-designed, but AI
‘thinking’, robots in the not-so-distant future.

Future (in) Conflict

The ethical question we have to answer is to what extent we wish to value robotic heri-
tage. This issue has three levels that need to be considered.

Do We Wish to Value these Aspects of Heritage in the First Place?

One  could  argue  that,  after  all,  robots  and  the  programs  that  run  them  are  human
constructions in the first place. Even with increasing AI capabilities, they are ultimately
just machines, on which we can pull the plug at any time.

International Journal of Heritage Studies

13

That  line  of  argument,  however,  is  not  very  compelling  as  there  is  already  an
abundance of technological sites on the various national heritage lists. Indeed, even the
World Heritage List contains places that have been nominated for their technological
evidence. As heritage managers worldwide seem to have a love affair with technological
monuments,53 there is no reason to assume that this should be any different when it
comes to robotic heritage.

There is one additional philosophical question we have to ask as heritage managers:
at what point does an artefact cease to be a human artefact and become a ‘robofact’, one
purely  created  by  a  robot?  The  exploration  of  such  robofacts  and  their  curation  is
beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed elsewhere.54

Artefacts and sites created by robots, especially the first examples as derived from
independent thought, would certainly qualify as heritage sites under standard rules as
they  reflect  on  human  heritage.  But  as  it  stands,  while  an  inclusion  from  a  human
perspective is possible, the heritage registers could not deal with the inclusion of sites
that are registered for their significance from a robot perspective. Thus unless humans
value the sites/artefacts, they will not be listed/collected. In that regard robotic heritage
will share the same fate as until recently faced by ethnic, minority, African-American
(in the USA) and women’s sites. In the absence of formal regulations and processes, it
will be up to the sole discretion of the heritage manager to consider them. In essence,
to the well-entrenched concepts of sexism and racism we can now add the concept of
silicon-based specism.

What about Value Conflicts?

In  the  current,  solely  human-derived  heritage  environment  many  practitioners  are
faced with the problem of resolving conflicts over heritage. Competing use of proper-
ties  and  demand  for  alternative  uses  of  limited  land  for  development  means  that
impacting  on  heritage  properties  is  commonplace.55  In  some  countries/settings  the
value conflicts are being played out along ethnic, religious or social class lines.56

It does not take much imagination to foresee a situation where the protection of
robotic heritage will be in conflict with human development interests. Which values
should prevail? If history and current practice is any guide, it will be the human values.
But do we need processes in place that will allow a considered decision to be made
before it is too late?

What Rights Do AI Robots Have?

The most challenging, final question relates to the rights that AI-imbued robots might
have. Given that values and rights as we construct them to be are an anthropogenic
concept, the matter can be easily, if dictatorially, resolved with a resounding ‘none’.

This would be oversimplifying the matter, however. Several human ethicists have
been discussing the rights that should be ascribed to our closest living ancestors among
the great apes, in particular chimpanzees. Peter Singer has been advocating that the
great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla and orang-utan) should be afforded ‘three basic rights

14 D. H. R. Spennemann
… the right to life; the right to liberty; and the right not to be tortured’.57 Singer bases
his claim on the observation that in his view they are 

beings who possess many of the characteristics which we consider distinctive in our
own species. They form close and lasting attachments to others; they show grief; they
play; when taught sign language, they tell lies; they plan for the future; they form polit-
ical coalitions; they reciprocate favours, and they become angry when someone for
whom they have done a favour does not respond similarly. Their intellectual abilities
have been compared with those of children between two and three years old, and their
social bonds are stronger than we would expect from a child of that age.58

Ultimately it comes down to the question of what makes us human and the rest of the
world not. One line of argument, the last barrier so to speak, has been that we humans
are capable of self-awareness. However even this distinction will soon become irrele-
vant. Once we ascribe great apes a set of rights based on Peter Singer’s concepts then,
by extension, such rights needs to be considered too for robots once future AI-driven
robots  have  the  ability  to  make  independent  decisions.  If  the  distinction  regarding
rights-holding animals is made based on social and intellectual characteristics, and is
not based primarily on genetic similarity to us humans, then the fact that robots are
artificial life forms should not enter into the debate.

The most cogent argument against the conveyance of inalienable rights to animals,
at least under the anthropocentric concept of rights,59 also confers the corollary, the
ascription of duties and obligations. While the fulfilment of such obligations can be
expected of humans,60 it quite clearly cannot be expected of the great apes.

Assuming  that  robots  essentially  fall  into  the  same  category  as  the  great  apes  is
underestimating  the  potential  of  future  robots.  While  the  assumption  will  most
certainly be consistent for the first generation(s) of independent-acting robots, that
assumption falls short once we are contemplating fully sentient and self-aware robots.
These  paradigms  assume  that  the  individual  (human  or  robot)  concerned  not  only
possesses the capacity for basic consciousness (sentience), but also possess the ability to
perceive their own existence (self-awareness). It is that level that will set robots apart
from the great apes and thus will allow the reciprocal element of rights and obligations
to be fulfilled.

There  has  been  limited  discussion  of  the  legal  nature  and  standing  of  artificial
intelligence61 and derived from there the rights of (future generations of) robots. Frei-
tas raises the issue that self-aware robots should be afforded rights, and then considers
a long list of issues where such rights might not mesh well with the current human-
focused legal system of the USA.62 The other, and well-cited, paper by McNally and
Inayatullah  works  along  similar  lines,  and  explores  the  interrelationship  of  human
obligations  and  responsibilities,  as  well  as  the  obligations  and  responsibilities  of
robots.63 At present no real work has been carried out on conceptualising the interplay
of AI-derived and human value systems.

If we ascribe rights to robots, then we have to set in place processes that ensure that
these  rights  are  not  violated  when  we  are  dealing  with  robotic  heritage  places  and
artefacts. It is self-explanatory that these processes, at least in the first instance, will be
based on human value sets and priorities.

The matter can be elevated to an even higher ethical plane when we contemplate that
AI-imbued robots may possess the evolutionary programming capability to develop
their own value sets. The underlying assumption of most of robotics and the ethical
literature surrounding it is that the three laws of robotics as postulated by Asimov in
1942 are essentially feasible. Asimov construed his robots as being essentially subservi-
ent to humans. But what will be the outcome if the values we ascribe to robotic artefacts
and sites are not congruent with the robots’ own values?

Future Heritage—Quo Vadis?

This paper has raised some serious issues relating to our construction of heritage and
how this may apply to artefacts and sites created by robots capable of (semi-)indepen-
dent thought through improved AI algorithms.

While some of the issues appear quite futuristic in concept it must always be remem-
bered that the technological developments are progressing at an ever-accelerating pace.
Whether  or  not  the  reader  meets  the  reasoning  in  the  paper  with  disbelief,  the  fact
remains that it is only a matter of time until we have to face up to the question: what is
the nature and future of the Earth’s robotic heritage?

Unless we seriously consider the implications of the matter, we will stand accused by
future generations of not protecting the emerging heritage while we had the chance.
The  precautionary  principle  should  apply  in  this  case.  Ultimately  this  is  an  ethical
discussion that heritage managers need to have. This paper is just the start.64

It is acknowledged that a delisting of heritage places is rarely the case. Most heritage lists are
additive  and  cumulative.  Many  heritage  lists  are  replete  with  examples  of  early  inclusions
based  solely  on  the  ‘merit’  of  age  and  ‘prettiness’,  without  any  concern  given  to  assess  the
underlying heritage values. At present, delisting occurs only where sites are no longer extant
(due  to  demolition  or  loss  from  natural  disasters)  or  where  the  property  has  been  severely
impaired (due to modification or disaster impact).There is no need, however, to assume that
this practice will remain the case if new heritage management paradigms are espoused. As the
recent developments in Australia have shown, existing lists can be ‘pruned’ by the creation of
new  lists  with  more  selective  and  stringent  criteria  (the  new  National  Heritage  Register  as
opposed to the old Register of the National Estate).

In  his  1942  short  story  ‘Runaround’  Asimov  first  explicitly  introduced  his  three  laws  of
robotics, to which in 1985 he added a fourth which underpins the previous three (and hence is
referred to as the zeroth law of robotics)(Asimov, Robots and Empire): 

0. A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come

to harm.

2. A  robot  must  obey  orders  given  it  by  human  beings  except  where  such  orders  would

conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with

the First or Second Law.

‘Sol’ is a term that defines one solar day on Mars, i.e. one full revolution of a planet around its
own axis. On Earth a sol is colloquially termed a day. As planets rotate around their axes at
different speeds, the use of ‘day’ for Mars would be misleading because people would equate a
‘day’ on Mars with 24 hours (as defined on Earth), whereas in fact a Mars ‘sol’ lasts 24 hours,
39 minutes and 35 seconds on Earth. See M. Allison and R. Schmunk, ‘Technical Notes on

57[57] The observation that these rights are not always observed among human populations either,
despite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN General Assembly Resolution 217 A

this regard. That is a matter of enforcement but not of conceptual understanding.

59[59] The anthropocentric view of rights assumes that there are no intrinsic values and no rights
that exist ab initio. Rather, all such values and rights are entities conceptualised and projected
by sentient beings.

60[60] Common ethical and legal practice holds that these obligations cannot be expected from non-
sentient and mentally impaired humans, as exemplified by the rule of diminished responsibil-
ity in various legal systems.

to the Royal Institute of Engineers will play a prominent role.
