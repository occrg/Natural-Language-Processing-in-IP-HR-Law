This article studies contemporary Australian copyright and contrasts this to a large-scale online survey on ﬁle sharing
in order to analyse the seemingly parallel and non-compliant legal and social norms that they represent. Furthermore, a
selection of 3,575 Australian respondents to an online survey is compared to a near global group of over 96,000
respondents, allowing determining distinctive traits of the Australian respondents. For example, the latter use ofﬂine
methods for sharing and receive rather than distribute content to a higher extent in comparison to the global group of
respondents. Furthermore, Australian respondents also have slightly less predominance of male sharers.

Introduction

What type of a crime is online copyright infringement, often referred to as “online piracy?” How do we
come to terms with it? Given its commonness, a multitude of studies released show how a majority of
primarily the younger generation has ﬁle-shared copyright-protected ﬁles, or in general does not feel that
there is something wrong with this (cf. Andersson Schwarz and Larsson, 2014; de Kaminski et al.,
2013; Feldman and Nadler, 2006; Gracz, 2013; Karaganis et al., 2012; Larsson, 2013a; Poort and
Leenheer, 2012; Svensson and Larsson, 2012). This particular behaviour, which may be at odds with a
near globally homogenous regulation, is closely connected to digital development and takes part in a
context with strong political and industrial inﬂuences. This makes it a challenging problem but also an
interesting one, which, to compare it to Nelken’s account on white-collar crime, “appears to straddle the
crucial boundary between criminal and non-criminal behaviour” (Nelken, 2012, p. 631). The dilemma that
Nelken identiﬁes is that many white-collar crimes are “merely technically criminal” and are not socially
considered on par with ordinary crimes and therefore do not “satisfy the requirements of a sociological
deﬁnition of crime” (2012, p. 632). In other words, how the particular crime of illegal ﬁle-sharing is
regarded in general, is of great interest here. As discussed below, the social norm among important groups
in society does not follow the legal norm. Perhaps, in the case of illegal ﬁle-sharing we need to call the
concept of using the law to draw the line into question. Anyhow, the binary approach on criminal or
non-criminal behaviour clearly needs to be problematized here. Yet again reminded by Nelken’s analysis
of white-collar crime, it is possible that online piracy, like white-collar crime, “illustrates the possibility of
divergence between legal, social, and political deﬁnitions of criminality—but in so doing it reminds us of
the artiﬁciality of all deﬁnitions of crime” (Nelken, 2012, p. 632).

File-Sharing and Contemporary Copyright Development in Australia

So, while reminded of this “artiﬁciality of all deﬁnitions of crime,” we turn to the explicit case of
online-ﬁle sharing as a copyright infringing activity en masse. Peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁle sharing “has gained
notoriety for facilitating Internet piracy” internationally (Lambrick, 2009, p. 185). In a study on social
norms relating to copyright, Svensson and Larsson (2012) conclude that “[t]he sharing of computer
programs, movies and music via the internet marks an all-time-high in the persistent controversy between
intellectual property owners and the users of different reproduction technologies” (2012, p. 1147; cf.
Larsson, 2011). This indicates, much like the American legal scholar Lawrence Lessig argues (2008), that
the issue is bigger and more structural than just relating to a few deviants and rather regards a generation of
Internet “natives” (cf Palfrey and Gasser, 2008). The infrastructural account on the emergence and
subsequent commonness of ﬁle-sharing is further emphasized by Andersson Schwarz (2013) when using
Sweden as a strategic case study. Consequently, Lysonski and Durvasula (2008) point out that lawsuits
seem neither to slow down the rate of unauthorised ﬁle sharing, nor solve the issue. Moreover, others have
noticed that the use of tools that make ﬁle-sharers harder to trace in an online context are more common
amongst high-frequency sharers (Larsson et al., 2012b) and the overall use of such tools are increasing
(Larsson et al., 2012a), indicating that the enforcement of legislation is increasingly difﬁcult.

File sharing technologies such as BitTorrent have had a profound affect on how individual’s perceive
and abide by copyright laws in the digital landscape (Larsson, 2013a,b). This is particularly prominent in
Australia, which has been reported in the media as having one of the highest rates of TV copyright
infringements in the world (Taylor, 2012). According to 2011 data from the Music Industry Piracy
Investigation, now known as Music Rights Australian, an estimated 2.8 million Australians are reported to
download music illegally each year (Music Industry Piracy Investigation, 2011; Paterson, 2012).
Furthermore, data from the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft estimated some $1.370 million
in Gross Output lost across the entire Australian economy due to movie piracy in 2010 (Ipsos MediaCT,
Oxford Economics, 2011, p. 3).

It is therefore important to empirically look at both the legal development as well as, for example, the
ﬁle-sharing practices that exist parallel to legal development. This study will thus elaborate quite
extensively on contemporary development and the status of copyright in Australia. Subsequently, this
article will then elaborate on the reality of ﬁle-sharing by analysing a rich sample of respondents in a
survey conducted by the Cybernorms research group in 2012 on this practice.

Purpose and Research Questions
The purpose of this article is to better understand digitally mediated copyright infringement in relation to
the legal structures criminalizing this infringement. In doing so it focuses on the case of Australia. The
study is twofold: on the one hand it consists of a legal investigation of trends in contemporary Australian
copyright and on the other it provides a contrasting empirical survey of actual ﬁle-sharing behaviour in
Australia. In order to be able to follow this purpose, we ask the following explicit questions:

1. In terms of demographics, who is the typical Australian ﬁle-sharer?
2. To what extent are Australian ﬁle-sharers on this account diverging from others?
3. What is the character of the Australian IP regulation in relation to international treaties and trade
agreements, enforcement, the role of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and its contemporary
development overall.

In May 2012 the Cybernorms research group conducted a survey on ﬁle sharing via collaboration with
the infamous Pirate Bay (TPB). The survey was reached via a link from the main page of TPB, by clicking
a remodelled TPB logo termed “The Research Bay” showing a magnifying glass over a pirate ship.
Visitors who clicked on the altered logo were transferred to an online survey that was open for 72 hours.

The survey received over 96,000 respondents, of which 3,575 respondents answered that they are from
Australia. This data forms the empirical basis for this study. This also allows Australian respondents to be
compared to the global results.

Australian File-Sharing

Understanding the legal and political context goes some way to explaining the prominence of P2P ﬁle
sharing in Australia. This is particularly due to the fact that the Copyright Act has not been used
signiﬁcantly against individual P2P ﬁle sharers, allowing the private use of infringing content to be
regulated but largely unenforced. However, there are also other social considerations that form part of the
rubric. Australia is notorious for its slow release of ﬁlms, TV shows and music albums. For example the
release of The Great Gatsby was released in the United States almost an entire month prior to being
released in Australia, where the movie was actually ﬁlmed (Jericho, 2013). As a number of respondents to
the survey outlined in this study, having access to content without waiting for the Australian release date is
a reason that drives them to use P2P ﬁle sharing to illegally download movies. A survey conducted in 2012
by Swinburne University of Technology indicated that getting access to “hard to get content” (Ewing and
Thomas, 2012, p. 33) was very important to a quarter of ﬁle sharing users surveyed when asked why they
ﬁle-shared. This is signiﬁcant and may reﬂect the need to pressure Australian networks in releasing
international movies and TV shows into the Australian market sooner. An article by TorrentFreak that was
widely publicized in a number of international news media articles (Ernesto, 2013) cited Australia as
having the highest piracy rate of downloads of Season Three of Game of Thrones. While the popular TV
show premiered in the United States on the 31st of March on HBO, fans of the show had to wait until the
1st of April for its release in Australia. While this date itself is not excessive, even a day delay appeared to
provide opportunity and excuse for ﬁle-sharers to illegally download the series. Furthermore, as
entertainment journalist Hardie (2013) recognises, the fact that the series is only available on Foxtel, a
pay-TV network provides a catalyst for “prompting a wide, and voracious, audience desperate for the
content to explore alternative options.”

Music Rights Australia estimates that in 2010 the number of Australian Internet users who admitted to
downloading unauthorised content,
including music via BitTorrent, at 27.8% (Music Rights
Australia, 2013). However, according to the 2012 report conducted by the Swinburne University of
Technology, ﬁle sharing services such as BitTorrent decreased in use in 2011 (Ewing and Thomas, 2012).
The report suggests that perhaps this decrease can be attributed to “greater awareness of the illegality of
some of this activity” (Ewing and Thomas, 2012, p. 32). Nevertheless, there may be alternate factors such
as the use of streaming websites that do not require downloading, or perhaps the increase of legitimate
sites. Spotify, an international sensation for legal music streaming, became available in Australia in 2012
and it will be interesting to ﬁnd out how the use of illegal P2P ﬁle sharing is affected by this legitimate free
service. While data seems to suggest that the underlying reason for illegal P2P ﬁle sharing, such as the use
of BitTorrent, is because it is free (Ewing and Thomas, 2012, p. 33), the increase in free legal sites may
signiﬁcantly limit the number of individual’s currently engaged in copyright infringement through the use
of P2P ﬁle sharing. Furthermore, with the anticipated reform to Australian Copyright law following the
recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, expected to be released late 2013, the
social norms surrounding copyright law are also likely to change with people opting for legal sources over
infringing ones.

Australian Copyright: Law and Enforcement

P2P ﬁle sharing as such is not directly prohibited under Australian copyright law or any other legislation.
This is because P2P ﬁle sharing will not involve a copyright infringement where the owner of the

File-Sharing and Contemporary Copyright Development in Australia

copyright material has provided consent to the material being shared. Australian copyright law does,
however, prohibit certain actions of P2P ﬁle sharing. While P2P ﬁle-sharing systems such as Napster,
Grokster and Australasian owned Kazaa were created to enable the downloading of copyright infringing
content, the systems also provided the ability to share non-infringing content. Unlike these systems
BitTorrent was created to “facilitate the legal sharing of live recordings of ‘Jambands”’ (Paterson, 2012,
p. 99) but has now become one of the major systems used for the transfer of copyright infringing material
(Bright, 2011). It is the use of P2P ﬁle sharing to share or trade copyright works that are obtained without
the consent of the author or without a license that give rise to an action for the infringement of copyright
under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).

Under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) and in line with the Berne Convention, published musical works,
sound recordings, cinematographic ﬁlms and artistic works are all protected under copyright. It is the
owner of a copyright work that has the exclusive right to reproduce the work and make the work public,
something that unauthorised P2P ﬁle-sharing inherently undermines. This constitutes infringement
under s 36 of the Act whereby “a person who, not being the owner of the copyright, and without the license
of the owner of the copyright, does in Australia, or authorizes the doing in Australia of, any act comprised
in the copyright.” The Act imposes strict liability, where the state of mind of an infringing party is only
relevant in the assessment of damages but not relevant in establishing a breach of the copyright owner’s
exclusive rights over works. While infringement of copyright is generally a civil action, depending on the
scale, commercial value, or commercial proﬁt of a P2P shared ﬁle, criminal penalties may be applied
under the Act including imprisonment.

In Australia, copyright protection has traditionally focused on economic rights, with the protection of
moral rights only being introduced by the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act 2000. Amendments
to the Copyright Act have been incremental following the Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement
in 2004 and the Copyright Amendment Act 2006 (Cth). The amendments were meant to bring Australia in
line with the system of copyright protection offered in the United States, modelling many provisions on
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (US). The Copyright Act now provides for the issue of
takedown notices, with the requirement resting on copyright owners to monitor content. Effectively, under
regulation 20U of the Copyright Regulations 1969 (Cth) ISP’s “must expeditiously remove, or disable
access to, the reference to the copyright material speciﬁed in the notice and provided by the carriage
service provider on its system or network.” The focus on protecting the economic rights of authors has led
to a system which favours the interests of the copyright holder, providing few exceptions to the public
under fair dealing provisions. The four long established exceptions are: advancing knowledge through
research, commentary by way of criticism or review, reporting news and the administration of justice. In
2006 fair dealing for the purpose of parody or satire and time and format shifting were also included as
exceptions.

Authorisation
The concept of “authorisation” was an early development in Australian copyright law. The authorisation
provisions of Australia’s Copyright Act 1905 (Cth) in fact provided a template for the British Copyright
Act of 1911, which was later adopted into the law of many British Colonies (Burrell and Weatherall,
2011). Therefore, the Australian legislature already had the framework in place when it gave into
international lobbying by the copyright industries to put greater pressure on ISPs by making them liable
for authorizing copyright infringement. This provided a way to ensure that ISPs worked with copyright
owners in enforcing copyright law because it established that ISPs could be held legally responsible for
acts of copyright infringement committed by their users (Burrell and Weatherall, 2011). It is perhaps this
change in policy, from bringing an action against the individual user and instead bringing an action against
the intermediary, that has contributed to the common use of illegal P2P ﬁle sharing. As Lambrick (2009,

File-Sharing and Contemporary Copyright Development in Australia

Stefan Larsson et al.

p. 191) acknowledges, “[i]ntermediaries such as content hosts, ISPs and carriers are more ﬁnancial and
less elusive than pirates and end users.”

International Treaties and Trade-Agreements
While the Australian government has not taken a hard line on P2P ﬁle sharing, Australian policy towards
copyright law has been inﬂuenced by developments in the international community and the international
approach towards the protection of intellectual property in general. Australia is a signatory to the Berne
Convention, the TRIPs Agreement, the WIPO Treaties, as well as a number of multilateral and bilateral
treaties such as the Australia-US free trade agreement. As a result there has been criticism that the
“Australian governments remain determinedly pragmatic in areas of music copyright, preferring to react
(slowly) to legal stoushes rather than incorporate into a broader music or cultural policy” (Homan, 2011,
p. 26). This criticism is reﬂective of much of the development of international copyright law, with the
myriad of opportunities the Internet now provides for the transfer of music, ﬁlm and other copyright
protected works. It is thus not strictly fair to criticize the development of Australian copyright policy on
this platform alone.

As mentioned, Australian copyright law was traditionally founded on the economic rights of the
author, thus the development of policy in protecting the rights of the author have been centred on
economic rights. The Copyright Amendment Act 2006 (Cth) determined a new copyright offence
structure and imposed stricter measures to protect copyright. This was in response to the growing use of
illegal downloading and the international increase in copyright infringement on a commercial scale.
During the second reading of the Act in the Senate, Senator Lundy (2006, p. 102) noted that the
new regime of strict liability ﬁnes for consumers who breach copyright “is unprecedented in the world
and…represents a massive win for the large corporations that have been lobbying the Howard
government to legislate to protect their interests.” Senator Lundy also criticised the then Howard led
liberal government for not adopting a general fair use exception for private use under the Act, a criticism
that was shared by other members of the Senate. With the Australian Bureau of Statistics National
Accounts (DFAT, 2012) valuing intellectual property in Australia in 2010–11 at $182.5 billion (AUD), it
is unsurprising that the interests of the copyright owner have traditionally prevailed over that of the
public in Australia.

The importance of trade in royalties for intellectual property for Australia in 2011 was estimated at
$1.1 billion (AUD) in exports and $5.2 billion (AUD) in imports (DFAT, 2012). Hence, the importance of
negotiating free trade agreements that reﬂect the signiﬁcance of intellectual property. The Australian
government signed onto the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) in October 2011. ACTA,
described as the “strongest intellectual property enforcement agreement to date negotiated at the
international level” (Bitton, 2012, p. 69) and not only a “country club agreement” but a “bad country club
agreement” (Yu, 2012, pp. 7–8; cf Yu, 2011), would impose greater criminal penalties than currently exist
for copyright infringement. Australia’s signature onto ACTA created public outcry and also some division
in the Australian Parliament, with the Greens political party outright rejecting the agreement (Masnick,
2012). However, ratiﬁcation of ACTA has come to a standstill, with the Australian Parliament’s Joint
Standing Committee on Treaties (2012, p. 61) recommending that ACTA not be ratiﬁed until the
government can provide an adequate evidentiary record that the agreement would be in Australia’s best
interests.

The pressure from the public and the realization that the enforcement of copyright law in the digital
context needs further reform has created a division in relation to the policy debate surrounding Australian
copyright law. With the ratiﬁcation of ACTA at a stalemate, Australia has also been participating in
Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which also has provisions that would extend the term of
copyright and provide stricter digital lock rules (Rimmer, 2012). On the other hand the Attorney-General’s

File-Sharing and Contemporary Copyright Development in Australia

Department, the department in charge of dealing with copyright in Australia, during the same period asked
the Australian Law Reform Commission to review copyright exceptions in the digital context.

Contemporary Revisions
Recognising that “Copyright law is an important part of Australia’s digital infrastructure and is relevant
to commercial, creative and cultural policy” (Australian Law Reform Commission, 2012) the
Attorney-General’s Department drafted Terms of Reference for the Law Reform Commission, which
asked whether amendments could be made to the current law to provide greater availability of copyright
material. The Commission has looked at whether there is a need to expand the exceptions for private use,
and more importantly in relation to ﬁle sharing networks, exceptions for online use for social, private or
domestic purposes. In June 2013 the Commission released its Discussion Paper, which presented a number
of proposed reforms including repealing the “fair dealing” exceptions and replacing them with a new “fair
use” exception (Australian Law Reform Commission, 2013). This would mean that when applied to
domestic and private use there would need to be a consideration as to whether the use falls within the
non-exhaustive list of fairness factors by examining: the purpose and character of the use; the nature of the
copyright material used; the amount and substantiality of the part of the copyright material used,
considered in relation to the whole of the copyright material; and the effect of the use upon the potential
market (Australian Law Reform Commission, 2013, Proposal 4–3). While this might give a wider scope to
exceptions under the Copyright Act, the Commission also made clear that unauthorised P2P ﬁle sharing
of copyright material would not fall within the fair use exception (2013, p. 1849.63). These
recommendations offer the public greater scope of access to Internet content, without fear of copyright
infringement, but need to be carefully drafted by the legislature so as to ensure clarity in the laws
application to enable the public to remain within the constraints of the law. The ﬁnal report is now before
the Attorney-General for consideration but whether amendments are made to the Copyright Act in light of
the recommendations still remains uncertain.

The Court’s Interpretation
As Urbas notes, “sentencing in Australian criminal copyright cases has historically been lenient compared to
the maximum penalties available” under the Copyright Act (Urbas, 2012, p. 20). Unlike in the United States,
where the Recording Industry Association of America sued over 20,000 individual users for unauthorised
sharing of music ﬁles (Boag, 2004), the Australian court system has never been used for large-scale lawsuits
against individual ﬁle sharers, even under civil sanctions. The court system has instead been used to
concentrate on the creators of websites that potentially host infringing content. Only as recently as 2003 did
an Australian court have its ﬁrst occasion to determine a large-scale online piracy case in the unreported case
of Tran, Ng and Le (unreported, NSW Local Court, Sydney, December 2003). Even in relation to the
notorious copyright infringing P2P ﬁle sharing site Kazaa, the Australian Federal Court in the case of
Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v. Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 opted for a balanced
approach rather than an overzealous one in making a determination for breach of the Copyright Act,
recognising the legitimate purposes of P2P ﬁle sharing. While the court ultimately found that the operators
of Kazaa were liable for authorizing infringements by ﬁle sharers, in making the order Wilcox J stated, “I am
anxious not to make an order which the respondents are not able to obey, except at the unacceptable cost of
preventing the sharing even of ﬁles which do not infringe the applicants’ copyright” (at [520]).

The court system has also been used to test the obligation and liability of private ISPs in removing
copyright content from websites they host. In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA
972 the Federal Court upheld a decision ﬁnding the website operator of mp3s4free.net, Stephen Cooper
and hosting ISP E-Talk, directly liable for copyright infringement. This was despite the fact that the site
did not host any such material, but rather served as a conduit through which users could ﬁnd downloadable

material for free. The court ruled that linking to such material was authorizing copyright infringement.
Additionally, the ISP was liable for copyright infringement because it had failed to take down the site.
While this decision seems to support placing an onerous obligation on ISPs to monitor the actions of third
parties to enforce the economic rights of copyright holders, more recently it appears that the court has
reverted to a balanced approach. This approach indicates that a less onerous obligation will be imposed on
ISPs to monitor content and enforce the rights of copyright holders.

In April 2012, the Australian High Court seemed to provide a less stringent approach to copyright
enforcement and the obligations on ISP’s to remove copyright infringing content and their liability for
authorizing copyright infringement. The decision in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd [2012] HCA 16
(iiNet case) was “the ﬁrst case of its kind in the world to get to judgment” (Hutcheon, 2011, p. 422). The
case was brought on appeal by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT). AFACT
represented no less than 34 Australian and US ﬁlm and TV copyright holders who alleged that ISP iiNet
had authorised copyright infringement by failing to terminate its contract with users who had used ﬁle
sharing software to engage in illegal downloads. None of the appellants brought legal action against the
individual’s who had in fact engaged in the illegal download of movies and TV shows through the
bit-torrent system. Instead AFACT issued iiNet with several notices indicating that these individual users
were infringing copyright and a failure by iiNet to prevent these alleged infringements “may constitute
authorisation of copyright infringement” (at [32]).

In ﬁnding that iiNet did not authorise copyright infringement by not terminating contracts with

individual users, the court emphasised that iiNet

[O]nly in an attenuated sense had power to “control” the primary infringements utilising
BitTorrent. It was not unreasonable for iiNet to take the view that it need not act upon the
incomplete allegations of primary infringements in the AFACT Notices without further
investigation which it should not be required itself to undertake, at its peril of committing
secondary infringement (at [146]).

This interpretation of the authorisation of copyright infringement has signiﬁcant implications for
individual BitTorrent and ﬁle sharing users, particularly if ISPs continue to have the role of enforcing
copyright holder’s rights by removing infringing content or an individual user’s right to access such content.
However, as Chief Justice French, Justice Crennan and Justice Kiefel identiﬁed in their joint judgment:

This ﬁnal conclusion shows that the concept and the principles of the statutory tort of
authorisation of copyright infringement are not readily suited to enforcing the rights of
copyright owners in respect of widespread infringements occasioned by peer-to-peer ﬁle
sharing, as occurs with the BitTorrent system. The difﬁculties of enforcement which such
infringements pose for copyright owners have been addressed elsewhere, in constitutional
settings different from our own, by specially targeted legislative schemes, some of which
incorporate co-operative industry protocols, some of which require judicial involvement in
the termination of internet accounts, and some of which provide for the sharing of
enforcement costs between ISPs and copyright owners (at [79]).

This statement recognises that the current copyright system is not well suited to the plethora of P2P
ﬁle sharing platforms that are arising in the digital context. The allusion to three-strikes laws, which
require ISPs to terminate the accounts of repeated copyright infringers and which have been adopted in
neighbouring New Zealand, is worrisome. However, the High Court also recognised alternative options in
enforcing copyright in the P2P context, which coincide with the reform that the Australian government is
currently considering. The outcome of the proposed reform will hopefully ensure a more cohesive and

clear copyright system that provides an adequate balance between the rights of the copyright holder, the
ISP and the public, reducing the number of illegal P2P ﬁle sharing.

Methodology
The legal development and contemporary status of P2P ﬁle-sharing in Australia is important in providing
the background of legal development and the context in which illegal ﬁle-sharing occurs. This concerns
Australian legislation, international treaties as well as court interpretation and the legal doctrines
emerging on such. On the other hand it is crucial to place these legal developments within an empirical
framework to see the actual effect of the law on ﬁle-sharers. As mentioned, a large-scale online survey was
conducted to study demographics, frequencies and opinions on ﬁle-sharing in such a way that Australian
respondents could be compared to a near global selection of respondents. In May 2012 the Cybernorms
research group conducted a survey on ﬁle sharing via collaboration with TPB. The survey was reached via
a link from the main page of TPB, and visitors who clicked on the altered logo were transferred to an online
survey that was open for 72 hours.

Empirical Findings

This section deals with the ﬁndings in the online survey conducted in May 2012. In this survey, 3,575
respondents answered that they were from Australia, which represents 3.7% of all the respondents in the
global study were 96,659 respondents participated. Of the global group, a majority on 52.5% came from
Europe, followed by 25% from North America. When it comes to gender distribution a very strong
majority of 93.6% (89,931) were male and 6.4% (6,183) were female in the global group, of the 96,114
that answered this question. This overrepresentation of men is clear also amongst the Australian
respondents but the female share is slightly higher at 9%. Furthermore, ﬁle sharers tend to be young.
Globally, 57.4% of the respondents are younger than 25 and 5.9% are older than 45, see Table 1. The
Australian respondents may be slightly younger with a larger group of those younger than 18 years old,
compared to all respondents.

Media Types
A question of key interest regards what kind of media is shared when ﬁle-sharing. Music is—despite
“free” legal streaming solutions such as Spotify—still one of the media types that are most shared (63.6%
globally, 67.7% in Australia), movies (78.6% globally, 81.5% in Australia), TV shows (62.6% globally
and 80.6% in Australia) and games/software (56.5% globally and 49.6% in Australia), see Table 6 below.
The sharing of TV shows is interestingly more common in Australia than in the global group.

Alternative Techniques for Sharing Files
Despite copyright legislation and its enforcement, the format or speciﬁc method used for sharing ﬁles is of
interest, and BitTorrent is of course not the only technique used for sharing ﬁles. For example, the use of
so-called one click hosting sites where you can share a folder or upload ﬁles for others to download via a

speciﬁc link are used by almost half of the global respondents (48.2%) and 43.5% of the Australian
respondents, see Table 2. Note that 54.6% in the global survey claim to use ofﬂine sharing, for example
USB sticks, mobile phones, CDs, which is represented by the signiﬁcantly higher share of 67.1% of the
Australian respondents.

Upload Versus Download
BitTorrent technically means that while you download, you by default also share the same ﬁle (upload)
with “the swarm” or network of nodes downloading the same ﬁle. That is, each downloader is also part in
contributing to other downloaders with the parts so far downloaded, and the way this can work is due to
that each and every ﬁle is divided into small pieces that are being copied and distributed continuously. This
is a very commonly used protocol for distribution of large amounts of data, also used by legit services like
Spotify (cf Andersson Schwarz, 2013; Larsson, 2013b). However, we study the intent of the sharing in this
study, and it is clear that most ﬁle sharers mainly intend to download and not to share with the community.
Globally, a majority of 65.3% never uploads any new material to the community, and only about 12% do
so more than once a week. Of the Australian respondents, an even higher 72.4% never upload and only
8.9% upload more than once a week, see Table 3. The Australian respondents download slightly more than

Anonymity and File Sharing
A way to measure an increased awareness of the need for protection against legal actions in the ﬁle sharing
community is to ask about the use of anonymity services, such as encrypted ones. Of relevance is that the
amount is not negligible; for example, approximately 16.4% of the global respondents use some variant of
VPN or encrypted anonymity service in the global selection, and a slightly lower 13.3% of the Australian
respondents do the same (see Table 5). Noteworthy, is that more than half of the respondents’ claim that
they want to be more anonymous online, a ﬁgure that is even higher amongst the Australian respondents
(see Table 5).

Analysis

From this brief analysis of the law and current policy debate surrounding Australian copyright law it seems
that perhaps the current state of copyright law is not clear for the general public. While copyright
infringement is heavily regulated with strict provisions against the infringement of copyright, it is not
often enforced against individual P2P ﬁle sharers, which adds to the gap between what the law actually

states and what law is actually observed. With the decision of the High Court in the iiNet case, it seems that
copyright owners cannot so heavily rely on ISPs to enforce their rights under copyright. More speciﬁcally
in relation to P2P ﬁle sharing, the Australian High Court noted that the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) is not
well suited to deal with the “widespread infringements occasioned by peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing, as occurs
with the BitTorrent system” (at [146]). This gap in the application of the law undoubtedly determines
social norms of the younger generation who seem to more frequently engage in P2P ﬁle sharing, as
measured in the Svensson and Larsson study, mentioned above (2012). Copyright reform is no doubt
needed to better reﬂect the changes in technology; however, it is not just the law that is likely to shape
social norms towards copyright in the future but also the changing structure of legal and free online
services. Moreover, there may also need to be more discussion on social changes through new media
structures. As the data suggest, sharing of TV shows is more pertinent in Australia than in the global group,
see Table 6. This is consistent with the response of a number of respondents to the study that identiﬁed that
waiting for release dates is a driving factor for engaging in illegal ﬁle sharing. This presents an opportunity
for TV networks to engage in discussion on release dates and the availability of TV programs so as to
prevent individuals from pursuing alternative and often illegal options to view the content they want.
Urbas claims that “most individual ﬁle-sharers do not consciously engage in acts of piracy or
counterfeiting” (Urbas, 2012, p. 11). As indicated by the data, perceptions of “online piracy” as something
related to “property theft”, that is, an act that is normatively wrongful, are likely to be weakly represented
in Australia’s younger generation, with over 60% of respondents aged below 25 (cf. Andersson Schwarz
and Larsson, 2014; Larsson, 2011, 2013a). This prompts the questions of the clarity of the law in relation
to copyright infringing ﬁle-sharing networks and whether the law reﬂects the changing perception of
society (Larsson, 2013a, 2014), in particular the younger generation. While the data gathered in the online
survey suggests that only a small percentage of ﬁle-sharers use VPN or a similar service to remain
anonymous online, 62.1% of those who completed the survey wish to do so. The extent to which online
anonymity has become common becomes obvious from a google.au search, where the search terms “bit
torrent” and “Australia” brings up on the ﬁrst page a Gizmodo Australia article on “How to Protect you
BitTorrent Privacy” (Wagner, 2012). As such the enforcement of digital copyright to avoid liability has
fallen onto ISPs. As Lambrick (2009, p. 191) acknowledges, “[i]ntermediaries such as content hosts, ISPs
and carriers are more ﬁnancial and less elusive than pirates and end users.” However, this monitoring role
is difﬁcult when the data shows that 67.1% of Australian respondents surveyed claimed to use ofﬂine
sharing. In this respect the enforcement of the Copyright Act becomes near impossible if the individual is
not sharing copyright infringing material on a commercial scale.

File-Sharing and Contemporary Copyright Development in Australia

Further, the issue of enforcement in a digital environment is of particular interest here. This is because
enforcement in a digital environment provides the potential embedded in the technological setting for both
governmentally enforced data retention and surveillance, which is counter-balanced by individually
enforced anonymisation through encryption (cf. Larsson et al., 2012a,b). In the midst of this, the role of the
ISPs has become crucial. As Urbas argues, “[i]ntellectual property (IPR) enforcement has been
transformed in the past 10–15 years by a combination of technological, societal and legal developments”
(Urbas, 2012, p. 11). The enforcement of Australian digital copyright against illegal P2P ﬁle sharing and
other forms of copyright infringement exempliﬁes this transformation. P2P ﬁle-sharing systems, such as
BitTorrent, “provide efﬁcient, decentralized mechanisms for end-users to distribute content, and which
are difﬁcult to police and control” (Lindsay, 2012, p. 51.2). Add the ability to hide an IP addresses through
the use of a proxy or virtual private networks (VPN) and the task of policing or enforcing an action of
copyright infringement against an individual becomes next to near impossible (cf. Larsson et al., 2012b;
Larsson and Svensson, 2010).

Particularly three differences between the Australian respondents and the global group stand out. The
ﬁrst, however hard to speculate on why it is so, regards that even though the gender bias is strong even
amongst the Australian respondents (9%) it is not as skewed as in the global group (6.4%). A second point
of interest lies in the commonness of ofﬂine sharing, found particularly in the Australian group with more
than three out of ﬁve (67.1%) using this particular method for sharing, see Table 2 above. Finally, the
degree of downloading is higher amongst Australian respondents compared to the global group and the
degree of uploading is lower, suggesting that the Australian ﬁle-sharers, to a higher extent than globally,
are receivers and “consumers” more so than sharers and contributors to the ﬁle-sharing community, see
Table 3.

Conclusion

Much evidence suggests that copyright in a digital society is suffering from a clear gap where parallel
norms exist. On the one side, legal development has primarily focused on control over content and on the
other side, a socio-technically dependent structure has allowed ﬂows of media over digital networks. This
particular study has elaborated upon Australian copyright development, which has its own disposition
but to a large extent is interconnected on a global level, tied together by supra-national and multilateral
agreements and treaties. This legal development is here compared and contrasted to a rather large online
survey where about 3,500 Australian respondents were compared to a large set consisting of over 96,000
global respondents. On the one hand this displays the parallel practices of copyright protected content
that seem so broadly accepted that any attempt to label it as “deviancy” does not sound reasonable. This
particular behaviour, which may be at odds with a near globally homogenous regulation, is closely
connected to digital development and takes part in a context with strong political and industrial
inﬂuences. In some communities, particularly those with younger members, the online copyright
infringement
in Nelken’s terminology, as “merely technically criminal”
(Nelken, 2012, p. 631). File-sharing therefore, in a sense, can be said to “straddle the crucial boundary
between criminal and non-criminal behaviour” (ibid.). When studying Australian ﬁle-sharing
speciﬁcally, it is of interest that it has been reported in the media as having one of the highest rates
of TV copyright infringements in the world (Taylor, 2012). The ﬁndings in the survey conducted in this
study indicate that the Australian respondents to a higher extent use ofﬂine methods for sharing than in
the global group of respondents. There is also a slightly less predominance of male sharers and seem to a
higher extent receive, rather than distribute, content in relation to the global group of respondents. The
results both suggest opportunities for example for TV networks that there are much to do with regards to
earlier release dates, and at the same time that the policymaker needs to be more humble when it comes to

its possibilities of controlling the parallel, technology-driven social norms that has developed in the
online context in this case.
