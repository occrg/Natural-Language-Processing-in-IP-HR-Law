The Lanham Act and the trade mark
monopoly phobia
Mohammad Amin Naser*

In 1952, Beverly Pattishall wrote:

[Courts] need have no fear that in protecting a trade-mark
a monopoly may be granted in anything that is public
property so long as [they] adhere [ . . . ] to the likelihood
of confusion test.1

Since then, much has changed. This article offers evi-
dence that, 60 years after the enactment of the Lanham
Act, monopoly fears continue to be present and threa-
ten the rights of other players in the context of the
‘trade mark formula’.2

This article reviews the Lanham Act, highlighting the
widening of
the current protection for trade mark
owners. It then argues that confusion-based protection
has been widened and reveals how dilution-based pro-
tection provides extreme protection to trade mark
owners. In conclusion, it argues that the Lanham Act
attributes to trade mark owners things that are effec-
tively public property.

Aims of the Lanham Act
Both before and during the enactment of the Lanham
Act, arguments concentrated on the fears that trade
mark rights might turn into powerful exclusive rights.
US courts and scholars ‘were troubled by the monopoly
implications of recognizing exclusive rights in words of
common speech’.3

[This] anti-trademark sentiment was shared in the aca-
demic community that viewed trademarks as a means for
creating monopoly power in favor of the trademark owner.4

Courts were ‘sometimes sensing intuitively that the
exclusionary nature of trademarks may be in some way
“monopolistic”’,5 being reluctant to rule in favour of

Key issues
† The Lanham Act was premised on the notion of
the dual purpose of protecting both the consum-
ing public and the trade mark owner in equal
measure. This was, at that time, considered to be
the proper solution to the monopoly phobia,
which was the common vision of trade mark
protection.

† Current protection of trade marks under the
Lanham Act has been expanded, through broad-
ening the consumer confusion doctrine, and the
adoption of the dilution doctrine, which does
not depend on confusion.

† The Lanham Act has abandoned the initial nar-
rowly conceived protection. It puts the rights of
the consuming public at risk and attributes to
trade mark owners things that are effectively
public property.

trade mark owners, which they considered to be
against the public interest:6 ‘the public interest will
suffer unless the courts are very cautious either in
recognizing . . . exclusive rights or in enlarging their
scope’.7 The US Department of Justice ‘asserted that
trade-marks are monopolistic and any statutory protec-
tion of them plays into the hands of big business and
should be discouraged’.8

Congressional discussions, acknowledging the fears
of monopolistic trade mark rights, sought an equitable
approach to trade mark protection. The Senate Report,
discussing the Lanham Act, stresses that the aims of
this Act are twofold:

One is to protect the public so it may be conﬁdent that, in
purchasing a product bearing a particular trade-mark
which it favorably knows, it will get the product which it
asks for and wants to get. Secondly, where the owner of a
trade-mark has spent energy, time, and money in present-
ing to the public the product, he is protected in his invest-
ment from its misappropriation by pirates and cheats. This
is the well-established rule of
law protecting both the
public and the trademark owner.9

This requires ‘confusion to the public [to be] the
essence of . . . trademark infringement’.10 Subsequent
judicial decisions asserted the dual purpose of
the
Lanham Act. Thus in Two Pesos Inc v Taco Cabana
Inc,11 the Supreme Court asserted that ‘the Lanham
Act’s purposes [are to secure] to a mark’s owner the
goodwill of his business and protecting consumers’
ability to distinguish among competing producers’.12
The US Court of Appeals, in Avery Dennison Corp v
Jerry Sumpton13 provided that:

Two goals of trademark law are reﬂected in the federal
scheme. On the one hand, the law seeks to protect consu-
mers who have formed particular associations with a
mark. On the other hand, trademark law seeks to protect
the investment in a mark made by the owner.14

Initially the Lanham Act aimed to protect the public
against confusion as to the source, as ofﬁcial congres-
sional documents indicate. Thus, the scope of the con-
fusion actionable should be assessed in accordance with
the aims stipulated by Congress.15 If these initial aims
were followed today, consumer confusion would be the
only test, and dilution would not be available. As one
scholar has argued:

[T]o the extent that [the mark’s] corresponding use by
others is likely to result in confusion of source with the
prior user, that much the prior user’s individual trade
identity should be protected and use denied to another –
no more no less.16

But what of the consumer confusion test? Arguably, its
standards have been widened now to serve to expand
the rights of trade mark owners.

Consumer confusion under
the Lanham Act
The proper standards of the confusion test
If consumer confusion is the test for trade mark infrin-
gement, which test of confusion is required?

This question is posed here in the context of
whether trade marks are ‘co-authored’ by owners and
the public,17 a notion that does not aim to deprive
owners of their entitlement over trade marks but rather
to acknowledge the rights of both parties. Thus an
equitable confusion test should focus on preventing
any confusion as to the source of products, assuring
trade mark owners that no diversion of trade exists. It
would also protect the consuming public, who would
not be led to products which they do not require. Such
a test would accord with the aims of the Lanham Act.

Likelihood of consumer confusion under
the Lanham Act
Confusion, before the introduction of dilution doctrine
in 1995, was ‘the hallmark of any trademark infringe-
ment claim’.18 This concept ‘has manifested a remark-
able ﬂexibility in its adaptation to . . . new realities’.19
The confusion concept is capable of developing to suit
current legal needs, and can form the sole basis for
trade mark infringement.

The Lanham Act provides that no sign which is
likely to cause confusion should be registered20 and a
trade mark owner has the right to ﬁle an opposition to
any application to register a mark which is likely to
cause consumer confusion.21 However,
if the owner
does not oppose the application and if, upon examin-
ation of the application, the Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce ﬁnds ‘that likelihood of confusion with prior
marks or names exists, the application is rejected ex
ofﬁcio’.22 The Lanham Act, which deﬁnes confusion,23
prohibits any use which will result in the likelihood of
confusing the consuming public and creates civil liab-
ility against such uses.24

The confusion sections under the Lanham Act raise
signiﬁcant questions, two of which are discussed below.

below, widened the scope of confusion applicability
and made it ‘danc[e] with dilution’.33

Actual confusion or likelihood of confusion?
For trade mark infringement under the Lanham Act,
‘[i]t is not essential to show actual confusion or decep-
tion in order to establish trademark infringement’.25
Rather, the trade mark owner is only required to prove
that the use of the mark by others is likely to cause
consumer confusion.26

the confusion test

The ﬂexibility of this requirement is that mere prob-
ability of confusion is enough to prevent the use of the
mark by others. The reason for requiring a likelihood
of confusion, rather than actual confusion, is to ensure
turns into a precautionary
that
measure to pre-empt
the damage before it occurs.
Nevertheless, ‘courts are unanimous in declaring that
probability of confusion means more than a mere
possibility of confusion’.27 Although ‘ordinarily evi-
dence of actual confusion is difﬁcult to secure’,28 if the
plaintiff is capable of proving that actual confusion
occurred, this would be a stronger proof.29

Types of confusion or expansion of confusion?
Since trade marks are source identiﬁers,
the only
primary type of confusion relates to source and occurs
when the second user adopts an identical or similar
mark confuses customers as to the source of the pro-
ducts in question. However, trade marks may serve
other secondary functions which could fall under the
ambit of the confusion doctrine, such as advertising
and informative functions (regarding sponsorship and
afﬁliation).30 These secondary functions may lead to
indirect confusion as to the source. In contrast, the
quality function cannot readily be assessed according to
the confusion test, in particular, since the deﬁnition of
quality differs from one consumer to the other.31

Advocates of a broad trade mark protection32
accordingly forged types of consumer confusion other
than source confusion in order to provide an implicit
introduction to the quality argument within the ambit
of the confusion doctrine. Such attempts, described

Subliminal confusion. This expansionist trend towards
favouring trade mark owners led in 1962 to the amend-
ment of the Lanham Act to include subliminal con-
fusion. The original wording of section 32(a) of the Act
required that confusion should be as to the source of
origin of goods or services, whereas the current proviso
does not require confusion to be as to the source and
origin. The Senate Report accompanying this amend-
ment gave no reason for this excision other than that
of ‘rearranging the language’.34 Courts contended that
‘the purpose of the amendment was to broaden the
scope of the situations in which confusion would result
in infringement’,35 and by eliminating the source and
origin phrase, Congress

evinc[ed] a clear purpose to outlaw the use of trademarks
which are likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception
of any kind, not merely of purchasers nor simply as to
source of origin.36

Contrary to the courts’ approach,
this amendment
appears not so much to introduce new situations and
types of confusion as to introduce the quality function,
based on utilitarian and economic justiﬁcations.

If the aim really had been to introduce new types of
confusion, there would have been no need to delete the
source and origin phrase in 1962 unless there is some
point in removing one type of confusion (source and
origin confusion) while retaining another (sponsorship
or afﬁliation confusion). The omission of source and
origin confusion has however led to the inclusion of
semi-dilution concepts, such as subliminal confusion.37

the marks’.40 In Lois Sportswear v Levi Strauss,41 the
court held that the Lanham Act was meant to prevent
confusion when the products in question ‘are observed
in the post-sale context’.42 This means that confusion
arises in the minds of
‘persons who have not yet
bought the goods at issue’.43

The division of the concept of confusion into pre-
sale and post-sale confusion is not based on reality
because if the confusion test as to the source is prop-
erly applied, there is no need to introduce a separate
category of post-sale confusion: the deployment of the
confusion concept would generally prevent any confus-
ing use of the mark, even before it confuses observers of
the infringing item.

From the two examples discussed above, it can be
argued that newly invented types of confusion do not
aim to prevent consumer confusion; rather, they seek
to expand the types of confusion and widen the scope
of confusion,
in order to give trade mark owners
broader rights. But is the failure of the Lanham Act
to deﬁne the scope of
the
reason for this unnatural expansion in the confusion
rationale?

conditions.

Since some courts were unable to determine the
scope of confusion under the Lanham Act,45 they
began to apply the confusion test even on non-
competing goods and/or services, being confused as to
the proper scope of confusion. Thus in Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders Inc v Pussycat Cinema Ltd,46 the defen-
dants portrayed an outﬁt almost

that no reasonable person would believe that the ﬁlm

was diminished.

Speciﬁcations of marks and products. The Lanham
Act does not distinguish between different situations
and expected scenarios of confusion in respect of the
degree of similarity between the marks and products in
any given case.

It is possible to identify three main scenarios of con-
fusion.44 The ﬁrst is the use of an identical trade mark
on identical products. In this situation, confusion is
presumed. The second category is the use of similar, or
even identical, marks over similar or identical products.
In this case, the likelihood of confusion should exist to
establish infringement. The third category is ‘well-
known marks’, where protection extends to dissimilar

Who should be confused?. An ideal assessment of
consumer confusion should take account of the aims of
the Lanham Act, according to which the focus on the
role of the public in the creation of trade marks plays
an important role. However, the Lanham Act does not
specify the quantity of consumers who have to be con-
fused in order for infringement to occur. This has led
courts to introduce criteria for the quantum of con-
fused consumers. For example,
in McGregor-Doniger
Inc v Drizzle Inc,50 the court said that ‘the crucial issue
is confusion on the part of an “appreciable number” of
consumers’.51 Other courts focused on ‘whether a sub-
stantial number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are

likely to be misled or confused as to the source of the
different products’.52

Although it could be argued that

the courts’
approach to the standard of the confused public is gen-
erally acceptable,
inconsistencies arise as a result of
their approaches being subject to change and modiﬁ-
cation. It is thus regrettable that the Lanham Act did
not address this problem.

Dilution under the Lanham Act
This section starts by examining another approach
which covers
the protection of well-known trade
marks, those which are the subject-matter of dilution
protection. It presents the substance of dilution theory
in the US and seeks to evaluate the current state of
dilution protection.

The rational basis for the protection
of well-known marks
Arguments in favour of dilution theory consider that
trade marks are the sole creation of their owners.53 By
this token, therefore, trade mark owners should be
rewarded for the creation of their trade marks. They
should also be assured proper incentives. Yet
this
scenario for the creation of trade marks is arguably
unrealistic:

trademark[s are] not . . . word[s] or symbol[s,] but an
association of an object with a sign. [They are] not
authored by the production/marketing of an object in its
package but by a joint
interpretive enterprise between
author and public.54

A well-known mark, before it became well-known,
must have been an ordinary mark, and the original
scenario as to the ‘co-authorship’ of ordinary marks is
still applicable. The difference in the case of well-
known marks is that two further steps are needed for
an ordinary mark to become well-known. First, the
owner of the mark provides more extensive effort in
advertising the mark, so as to enhance the association
of the mark with its products. Secondly, and more cru-
cially,
the public must more strongly associate the
mark with the products of the owner than is the case
for ordinary marks. It is this second step, provided by
the consuming public, which is decisive in the process
of authoring a well-known mark.

If one accepts that emphasis should be placed on
‘the public authorial role in associating a symbol with
an object . . . [which] creates competing interests of
the public as creator’,55 it can be argued that the con-
suming public should have more access to the use of
well-known marks, namely in cultural and expressive
contexts, as their reward for authoring such marks. In
the meantime, owners of well-known marks will enjoy
greater protection than owners of ordinary marks: this
is their reward for the efforts exerted in their marks.
On this theory, owners of well-known trade marks will
enjoy extra protection only within the boundaries of
the confusion rationale. Accordingly, BUICK for auto-
mobiles will be able to prevent the use of the mark
BUICK when used on aspirin products, if such use is
likely to confuse the public as regards the source of the
products in question. This could be achieved by giving
the owners of well-known marks the right to prevent
the use by others of any identical or similar marks on
dissimilar goods and/or services, provided that
the
owners of such marks can prove the existence of con-
fusion. This proposition provides owners with extra
protection where the trade mark is well-known, but
also considers the confusion of the public as the para-
meter for trade mark infringement.

The dilution concept under
the Lanham Act
This section discusses the dilution doctrine under the
Lanham Act. This requires a discussion of the aims of
the doctrine, to assess whether this concept is compati-
ble with the aims of the Act itself, followed by an
assessment of that Act’s dilution provision.

mere confusion’.57 Therefore, the focus is not directed
towards the confused public. Rather,
is directed
towards the injury to the owner’s interests, for whom
rights should be enhanced and entitlement should be
maximized, and is based on the premise ‘that the real
wrong arises out of dilution’.58

it

This emphasis on owners’ rights raises two speciﬁc
issues. First, it denies the role of the public as ‘co-
authors’ of trade marks with the owners. Secondly, it
risks allowing trade mark owners to monopolize words
in the English language, for little ﬁnancial gain,59 while
depriving the public of having their state of mind as
the test for infringement. In addition to this, the mark
cannot be employed in cultural and expressive uses. As
such, dilution is the ‘basis of trademark exclusivity that
has nothing to do with protecting consumers from

the
link between trademark protection and consumer
protection’.61

and ‘severs

In L.L. Bean Inc v Drake Publishers Inc,62 the court
asserted that ‘[t]he law of trademark dilution aims to
protect the distinctive quality of a trademark from
deterioration caused by its use on dissimilar pro-
ducts’.63 The court further reasoned that

[t]he overriding purpose of anti-dilution statutes is to prohi-
bit a merchant of noncompetitive goods from selling its pro-
ducts by trading on the . . . reputation of another’s mark.64

The court thus concluded that the rights of the owners
emerge from any probable diversion of trade, without
considering whether it is possible for any diversion of
trade to occur unless the public is confused.

In short, the aims of the dilution concept contradict
the aims of the Lanham Act. Thus it is no surprise that
the dilution concept does not refer to balancing the
rights in trade marks between the relevant parties.
Rather, the owner of a well-known trade mark is the
only player in the dilution ﬁeld.

1988: Congressional failure to adopt dilution

(TLRA) was introduced. Among the various amend-
ments to the Lanham Act was the addition of a

paragraph (c) to section 43 of the Act, which sought to
introduce the dilution concept into the Lanham Act.
This attempt ended in failure because of ‘its potential[]
anti-competitive aspects and freedom of speech con-
sideration’.65 However, examination of this unsuccessful
attempt assists
in understanding the amendments
which established the current dilution section under
the Act.

The Senate Report accompanying the Bill provides
that ‘[d]ilution occurs when a person adopts the mark
of another for use on noncompeting goods or ser-
vices’.66 To contest this deﬁciency, the ‘traditional trade-
mark infringement questions such as likelihood of
confusion and competition between the parties are not
at issue’.67 The report also indicates that marks eligible
for protection should not be only inherently distinctive,
but should also be famous. It also provides a number
of factors which should be weighed up cumulatively, in
order for the mark to be eligible for protection, as ‘no
one of them is determinative’.68

This Bill is given credit for the stress that it placed on
proof that the mark should be famous, and that all the
factors should be taken cumulatively in assessing a mark’s
distinctiveness and fame. Such requirements are not
applicable to the currently applied notion of dilution.

When the TLRA was introduced in the House of
Representatives, it was not passed, in the face of Repre-
sentative Kastenmeier’s concerns about the clash of
dilution with the First Amendment.69 A subsequent
proposal in 1995 fared differently, becoming the ﬁrst
federal introduction of dilution. Its content and effect
will now be discussed.

Deﬁnition of dilution
The FTDA deﬁnes dilution as ‘the lessening of the
capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish
goods or services’.70 This deﬁnition suffers from a
number of difﬁculties.

First, if it is accepted that the dilution concept lacks
justiﬁcation, the drafters of the FTDA have attempted
to override the principles of the confusion rationale so
as to legitimize that concept. Considering that dilution
is a lessening of the capacity of the mark to distinguish

the products to which they are afﬁxed, the drafters
have used the source and origin function to overcome
any objections to the quality argument upon which
dilution is based. However, reliance upon this notion
does not conform with the results of applying dilution.
Secondly, the deﬁnition provides that the likelihood
of confusion between the marks should not be regarded
when assessing dilution.71 It is not clear what input
this addition has; this article argues that the likelihood
of confusion test can accord protection to well-known
marks even when used on dissimilar products, provided
that confusion exists.

The legislative history of the FTDA indicates that ‘the
use of DUPONT shoes, BUICK aspirin, and KODAK
pianos would be actionable under this legislation’.72
Many people, even experienced practitioners, would con-
sider it obvious that BUICK aspirin does not originate
from the same source as BUICK automobiles; it might
seem, rather,
that such a use might strengthen the
public’s association with the ﬁrst user.73 Thus the source
and origin function is maintained. Moreover, the public
is the party which made BUICK for automobiles into a
well-known sign, so it is they who should retain the right
to alter or withdraw the amount of association they attri-
bute. By prohibiting further use of this mark for dissimi-
lar goods, when confusion does not exist, we prevent the
possibility of the beneﬁts of this new use infringing the
rights and entitlements of the public and other traders.

Types of dilution
The dilution concept embraces two types of dilution:
dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment.

Blurring
This type of dilution presumes that the use by a third
party of a famous mark blurs the distinctiveness of the
mark ‘if such use begins after the mark has become
famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of
the mark’,74 regardless of the existence of likelihood of
confusion.75 Thus, ‘[t]he wrong that the Dilution Act
prohibits is the reduction of the distinctiveness of the
plaintiff ’s famous mark’,76 which is manifest through

the erosion of ‘the strength of the mark as a unique
identiﬁer of the senior holder’s goods’.77

The reliance of this type of dilution upon the mark’s
‘distinctive quality’ is open to challenge. Distinctiveness
is the ability of the mark to denote the source and
origin of products and to distinguish the goods of one
undertaking from those of others. It is therefore a pre-
requisite for any sign that is to become a trade mark.
As one scholar argues, ‘all trademarks must be distinc-
tive either inherently or through acquired meaning’,78
and appropriately asks, ‘[i]f all marks are distinctive,
. . . what marks would be outside the protection of the
FTDA?’79 This sheds light on the crucial role of the
public in trade marks, and well-known marks in par-
ticular, in which the matter of distinctiveness lies in the
hands of the consuming public. This role, however, is
ignored under dilution by blurring.

Tarnishment
Tarnishment occurs where the second user’s use of the
mark affects those positive connotations which the
well-known mark enjoys. This transpires when,
for
example, the subsequent use of the mark is for an
inferior class of products, the link with which might
affect the image of the mark in the eyes of consumers.
As the courts have said:

[T]arnishment arises when the plaintiff ’s trademark is
linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed in an
unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke unﬂat-
tering thoughts about the owner’s product’.80

It is questionable whether the FTDA included this type
of dilution.81 Through its section 43(c), the FTDA only
refers to the distinctive quality of the mark, which is
the subject-matter of blurring. Denicola argues that the
drafters of the FTDA intentionally omitted the refer-
ence to tarnishment
the
‘[s]eparation of the tarnishment and dilution of dis-
tinctiveness theories was not an accident[, . . . and t]he
drafters should be held to their statutory language’.82
He argues that broadening the dilution concept in this
way, so as to include tarnishment, leads to rulings of
dilution in cases where dilution does not exist.83

However, the House Report ﬁrmly asserts that the
purpose of this Act ‘is to protect famous trademarks
from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of
the mark or tarnish or disparage it’.84 In the light of
this contradiction between the wording of the Act and
its legislative history, one court decided that it ‘need
not . . . delve into the difﬁcult question of how concep-
tually to ﬁt tarnishment within a theory of dilution’.85
However, a substantial number of court decisions con-

that

This is not the only problem faced when seeking to
understand the FTDA; there is also a clash between
tarnishment and the deﬁnition of dilution. If the FTDA
considers dilution to be deﬁned as the lessening of the
famous mark’s ability to distinguish the source and
origin of the products, how does one classify tarnish-
ment under this deﬁnition? It is unclear how the use of
the mark on inferior goods and/or services would
result in reducing the ability of the famous mark to
denote the source of the products. If this is so, tarnish-
ment could not fall under the deﬁnition of dilution
under the FTDA. Welkowitz raises similar concerns:

Nothing in th[e] deﬁnition [of dilution] directly refers to
business reputation, trademark tarnishment, or trademark
disparagement[,] . . . [and t]arnishment does not attack the
distinctiveness of
the unsavory
association does not mean that the consumer sees the
mark as designating more than one source.87

the mark. . . . [Thus,]

This suggests that tarnishment does not ﬁt under the
FTDA’s deﬁnition of dilution.

Scope of dilution under the FTDA
Not only does dilution doctrine widen the scope of
protection in favour of trade mark owners, but its pro-
ponents also have succeeded in widening the scope of
its applicability so that it becomes an effective mono-
polistic tool for the owners of trade marks. I shall
argue that dilution under the FTDA is extended to
include different types of trade marks.

Fame and its test
When Schechter envisioned his concept of dilution, he
focused on extending protection to a limited class of
trade marks, even in relation to non-competing goods.
This could easily be inferred from Schechter’s eagerness
to maintain the ‘uniqueness’88 of marks; he stressed
that of all marks, only ‘coined marks’89 should be
subject
to this expansive protection as opposed to
‘commonplace marks’.90 He restricted his argument to
the rejection of any use responsible for ‘impairing the
individuality’91 and ‘singularity’92 of
such marks.
Emphasis was placed on the fact that a dilution type of
protection should be limited only to a truly exclusive
set of marks, thereby retaining a high degree of fame.

The FTDA provides that entitlement to legal action
under section 43(c) be restricted to ‘[t]he owner of a
famous mark’ (emphasis added).93 It further provides a
list of factors which might be taken into consideration
‘[i]n determining whether a mark is distinctive and
famous’ (emphasis added).94 The legislative history of
the FTDA shows that this list makes provision for ‘non-
exclusive factors that a court may consider in determin-
ing whether a mark qualiﬁes for protection’ (emphasis
added).95 This list is thus not compulsory for courts to
follow, and is by no means exclusive; this is the ﬁrst
indication of the widening of the scope of dilution by
not necessarily requiring a compulsory set of factors
that a mark should fulﬁl in order to qualify for dilution
protection. This approach may be distinguished from
the 1988 Bill, which required such factors to be taken
into account cumulatively when assessing a mark’s
fame.96 Consequently, the standard of fame differed
from one court to another. Some courts considered the
plaintiff ’s mark to be ‘strong’ and directly concluded
that the mark was famous by virtue of its mere distinc-
tiveness;97 others did not even trouble themselves to
discuss the fame of the mark.98

In conclusion, such decisions show the widening of
the fame requirement. They also de-emphasize the
public’s association between the mark and the pro-
ducts, which should be the real injury in the ﬁeld of
trade marks.

Non-registered marks
The FTDA considers that if the mark is registered, this
is a factor which promotes its fame and distinctiveness,
and renders the mark eligible for protection.99 This
proposition indicates that registration is not a require-
ment
for dilution protection, but only a factor in
deciding on a mark’s fame. Not only this, but if the
user of a non-registered mark can prove that it is a
famous mark, then protection is provided ‘to [such]
famous marks, whether or not the mark is the subject
of federal trademark registration’.100

However, The Lanham Act was founded primarily
by the motive to provide protection for registered
marks at the federal
level. It was also intended to
promote the registrability of trade marks at a federal
level. It could not therefore have been meant to cover
non-registered trade marks.

The FTDA’s inclusion of non-registered trade marks,
under its scope of subject-matter, contradicts the inten-
tions of the Lanham Act. This widens the scope of
applicability, granting monopolistic rights to negligent
large businesses that do not take the initiative of regis-
tering their signs. It also broadens the scope of dilution
protection, so as to include an area which falls under
the ambit of common law. This raises the fears of some
scholars101 of turning the American legal system into a
civil law system, since the inclusion of non-registered
marks in the FTDA provides protection, which already
exists in common law.

Burden of proof: likelihood or actual dilution?
The burden of proof is a crucial issue in the ﬁeld of
dilution. That is, proof of dilution should be necessary,
and it can be argued that only extremely well-known
marks which have suffered actual harm should be able
to succeed in such cases. Nevertheless, the FTDA is silent
as regards the requirement of proving the existence of
actual dilution, or the mere likelihood of dilution. The
legislative history provides no indication either.102

One would expect the courts to provide a clear
answer concerning this requirement. However, there
has in fact been a split among the courts;103 some have

stressed that

it only requires

argued that the FTDA necessitates actual dilution,104
whereas others
that
dilution is likely to occur.105 For example, the US
Fourth Circuit Court in Ringling Bros.-Barnum106 held
that dilution consisted of a number of factors, among
which was the requirement that the junior use of the
famous mark caused ‘actual harm to the senior
mark[’s] economic value as a product-identifying and
advertising agent’.107 The court reasoned that,
if no
actual economic harm was required, then ‘property
rights in gross’ would be created in famous marks,
making them comparable to patents and copyrights.108
The court correctly concluded that this interpretation
of requiring actual harm ‘conﬁnes the federal dilution
claim to a . . . narrow scope’.109

In contrast, other courts have required no more than
a mere likelihood of dilution. The second Circuit
Court in Nabisco Inc v PF Brands Inc110 criticized
Ringling Bros.-Barnum and considered that

[R]equir[ing] proof of actual loss of revenue seems inap-
propriate[,] . . . [as] it would be extraordinarily speculative
and difﬁcult to prove that the loss was due to the dilution
of the mark.111

The court also stressed that the requirement of actual
harm in Ringling Bros.-Barnum opens the door to a
type of ‘injury [that] would never be compensated’.112
The court therefore concluded that the Act ‘permit[s]
adjudication granting or denying an injunction, . . .
before the dilution has actually occurred’.113

In the light of this split, the Supreme Court had to
intervene to settle this controversy. That court’s decisive
answer was in Moseley v V Secret Catalogue Inc.114

Moseley v V Secret Catalogue Inc
Moseley is of crucial importance. What lay at the heart
of the Supreme Court’s decision was whether the FTDA
required actual dilution or merely its likelihood. In this
case, the petitioners used the mark ‘Victor’s Secret’ on
their retail store for adult videos, novelties, and lin-
gerie. The respondents argued that
the mark was
similar, so diluting their famous mark ‘Victoria Secret’,
which was used on lingerie. The respondents ﬁled a

suit succeeding both in the District Court,115 and on
appeal to the Circuit Court.116 Moseley then petitioned
to the Supreme Court.

The court shed light on the language of the FTDA, in
particular in connection with the phrase: ‘if such use . . .
causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark’.117
The court provided that
‘[t]his text unambiguously
requires a showing of actual dilution, rather than a likeli-
hood of dilution’.118 The court also linked this interpret-
ation to the FTDA’s deﬁnition of the term dilution:

The contrast between the initial reference to an actual ‘les-
sening of the capacity’ of the mark, and the later reference
to a ‘likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception’ in the
second caveat conﬁrms the conclusion that actual dilution
must be established.119

The Supreme Court set out a more ﬂexible notion for
actual harm, which falls somewhere between the Ringling
Bros.-Barnum requirement of actual economic harm, and
the Nabisco Inc requirement of a mere likelihood of
dilution. While the Supreme Court stated that there was
no need to prove ‘actual loss of sales or proﬁts’,120 it
stated that ‘the mere fact that consumers mentally associ-
ate the junior user’s mark with a famous mark is not suf-
ﬁcient to establish actionable dilution’.121 This argument
appears correct inasmuch as the public’s association was
a rational decision on its part, which could not therefore
be manipulated by the junior use of the mark. Yet, the
mental association does not, of necessity, mean that the
mark’s capacity to distinguish the source of products is
in any way lessened. Consequently, mental association is
only relevant when the public is confused as regards the
source and origin of the products, and this is an area
which lies beyond the dilution zone.

Not only does the signiﬁcance of this decision derive
from the fact that it resulted in settling the dispute
among Circuit Courts, but, more importantly,

narrows the scope, thereby restricting the applicability
of the dilution concept. Although not entirely satisfac-
tory, this route was nonetheless the only one available
to limit the owners’ broad rights under the FTDA.
However, any consideration of harm to the public is
missing, especially insofar as the court’s decision ‘still
acknowledged some property rights in trademark[s]’.122
the dilution concept opposed the
Supreme Court’s decision in Moseley. Some scholars
argued that this decision failed to discuss ‘how to prove
“actual” dilution’.123 Others argued that, during the
hearings of the FTDA, ‘Congress was concerned with the
severe implications that might result if dilution occurred
and was allowed to continue’, which contradicts the
rigid rule of the court.124 Consequently, ‘[i]n the wake
of Moseley, Congress has begun to consider amending
the FTDA’,125 which opened the way for the introduction
of the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2005.

2006: Expansion of dilution
The Trademark Dilution Revision Act 2005 (TDRA)
became effective in 2006. Its effects are manifold. Pro-
ponents of dilution argue that the TDRA provides
clarity to the FTDA and is ‘a sensible and progressive
reform of American federal antidilution protection’,126
forming ‘an appropriate solution to the interpretive
difﬁculties plaguing the courts’.127 Critics of dilution,
however,
the TDRA has
expanded its scope.

remain concerned that

The TDRA reversed the effect of Moseley, requiring
only the likelihood of harm to prevail in a dilution
claim.128 The House Report, accompanying the TDRA,
provides that ‘[t]he Mosely standard creates an undue
burden for trademark holders who contest diluting
uses’,129 hence ‘in response to the Mosely decision,
actual harm is not a prerequisite to injunctive relief ’.130
