intensity as the legions of screaming Stones’ concert
fans. An indignant minority sniffed that a more suit-
able sobriquet for the band should be the ‘world’s most
professional rock and roll band’ in view of their shame-
less plumbing of
‘the depths of corporate sponsor-
ship’.12 Nevertheless, with declining royalties
from
plunging record sales and internet ﬁle-sharing,
the
scales have fallen from most rock musicians’ eyes as
they effortlessly shed this reluctance to go corporate
and enthusiastically joined the entire music entertain-
ment industry in adopting the Stones’ corporate spon-
sorship and merchandising business model.13

Branding for merchandising purposes is now a
major component of every musician’s platform for
success,14 as music-related merchandise licensing has
generated an estimated US$110 billion from retail
sales of licensed products.15 This income is expected
to increase further in the face of declining revenues
from recorded music sales due to piracy and chang-
ing music consumption habits.16 Given that
the
multi-billion dollar music industry has a broader
economic impact as it employs some two million
people globally17 and considering Japan’s important
US$5.167 billion18 dollar
recorded music market,
trade mark cases like Uprise, which determine the
scope of protection of these valuable music brands,
deserve scrutiny.

The litigated lips logos: factual
background
In June 2007, Uprise Product Yugen Kaisha, a Japanese
music management and production company, ﬁled an
application for a red device trade mark consisting of a
human tongue and lips (see below) for goods and ser-
vices in classes 9 and 41, such as records,
internet
downloaded music, pre-recorded discs, and planning
arrangement of musical performances and presentation
of musical performance.

Japanese visual kei is a J-Rock subgenre characterized
by a music style that combines rock, metal, and punk
with ‘melodies typical to most Japanese pop songs’ skil-
fully coupled with the performers’ liberal use of make-

tumes that make Kiss look boring’.20 A cursory search

In June 2008 Musidor, the Dutch corporation that
owns the Stones’ trade marks and IP, opposed the Uprise
registration on the ground that it was likely to be con-
fused with their world-famous tongue-and-lips mark and
senior trade mark registrations (below). Accordingly, the
Uprise mark should be refused registration under section
4(1)(xv) of the Japanese Trade Mark Law,22 which prohi-
bits the registration of a trade mark which is likely to
cause confusion in relation to the goods or services of the
business of another person.

Euro-American bands like Scorpions and Kiss, many new Japanese visual
kei bands ‘despite many clear differences in performing styles, have
emerged with similarly androgynous looks to massive attention’.

In August 2009, the JPO accepted the opponent’s
likelihood of confusion argument and partially revoked
certain goods and services,
including CDs, DVDs,
records, and musical performance from the offending
registration. Uprise swiftly appealed to the Intellectual
Property High Court of Japan (IPHCJ).

IP High Court decision
Degree of similarity
Presiding Judge Takaomi Takizawa, on behalf of a
unanimous panel of
the IPHCJ (Fourth Division),
found that even though there were some visual simi-
larities between the appearance of the respective marks,
which shared the composition consisting of the reddish
coloured upper lips, reddish coloured tongue hanging
out from a mouth, a white front teeth-shaped ﬁgure,
and the black coloured inside of the mouth, the IPHCJ
pointed out
signiﬁcant differences between
them.

several

Uprise’s trade mark consisted of a two-dimensional
image, while the Stones’ lips and tongue logo was por-
trayed three-dimensionally. Uprise’s trade mark also
featured three long black stylized conﬁgurations—
apparently the Roman letters A, B, and C—emanating
from the centre of the mouth, while the opponent’s
marks consisted of tongue-and-lips simpliciter. As such
there were ‘conceptual and visual differences between
the marks’. The IPHCJ held that the two marks ‘have
nothing in common; even though they have the same
composition in appearance, they are found to give
different impressions with different points’.

Degree of fame and originality of opposing
mark
The IPHCJ noted that

the Rolling Stones is a famous rock band active at the
front line for more than 40 years since the 1960s. The
cited trade mark was ﬁrst adopted for the sleeve of the
Rolling Stone’s record put on sale in 1971, and has been
continually used for its records, CDs, and other goods
since 1971.

The CDs and records of the Rolling Stones have been
continuously sold in Japan since the 1960s, generating
huge and signiﬁcant sales over the years. Moreover, given
the fact that the cited trade mark has been used on music
distribution sites and for advertisements of the band’s per-
formances, the cited trade mark is found to have been
widely recognized and to have become famous among the
traders and consumers in the music business, as a mark
indicating the goods or services pertaining to the business

of the Rolling Stones. Furthermore, the cited trade marks
are found to be a novel ﬁgure, having originality.

among

Japanese

consumers

However, even though the IPHCJ found that Stones’
lips and tongue logo to be ‘a novel ﬁgure, having orig-
inality’, since the opponent’s logo was well known and
famous
and music
businesses, this fame and distinctiveness ‘made it easier
for consumers to be conscious of the differences of the
marks’.
Status of business transactions
In one of those rare intersections of law and culture
where jurists must opine on the subtle yet weighty
nuances of rock-music genres, the IPHCJ found that

this music form is difﬁcult

Japanese pop music, while inﬂuenced by Western styles,
has successfully evolved differently from the West on its
own. Acid’s music is classiﬁed in the so-called visual kei
genre originally developed in Japan, often playing rock-
in a broader rock genre.
style music, but not limited,
In that sense,
to make a
clear categorization, but this visual kei genre of J-POP
is not similar to the Rolling Stones rock genre devel-
oped overseas. The Rolling Stones, at
its peak in the
1960s, was a young British rock band at the time, cur-
rently with a fan base that is in their 50s and 60s. Acid
fans comprise of teenagers to thirty year olds, and these
two fan demographics are different. In particular,
the
patrons who pay to see the Acid music performances,
or buy their DVDs, are usually devoted fans that are
familiar with Acid.

The IPHCJ held that ‘concerning the ﬁeld of music
where preference has a high priority, it is common for
consumers to carefully scrutinize the object which they
intend to purchase or participate in a concert with
appropriate care. . . . At the same time, as traders in this
ﬁeld such as record stores are generally experts on
music, it is hard to believe that there can be the consu-
mers and dealers of the goods and services attached
with the disputed mark will be confused’ with the
opponent’s goods and services bearing the lips and
tongue mark.

The court concluded that Uprise’s trade mark did
not satisfy the requirements of the Section 4(1)(xv) bar
to registration. In January 2010, the IPHCJ accordingly
reversed the JPO’s revocation decision and dismissed
Musidor’s trade mark opposition.

World’s most famous rock logo loses
This adverse trade mark opposition verdict from the
IPHCJ against the world’s most famous rock logo will
ring the alarm bells in the ofﬁces of anxious trade
mark attorneys everywhere. Admittedly, the arcane dis-

cussion of a J-Rock sub genre, visual kei, appears to be
like other small stakes subcultures—for example noc-
turnal gnomes or medieval shrubbery. However, size-
able commercial considerations are at
stake. The
Stones’ lips and tongue logo was valued at a staggering
US$200 million in 2003.23

the deﬁning symbol of

The Rolling Stones’ extensive worldwide merch-
andising programme
relies heavily on imagery
created and connected with the band and its indi-
vidual members, but
the
band is the drawing of a mouth with large lips and
protruding tongue. This renowned logo was named
by the venerable Victoria and Albert Museum as
‘arguably the world’s most famous rock logo’ when
it acquired the original artwork for its permanent
museum collection.24 The Stones’ trade mark savvy
is self-evident
from its canny adoption, vigorous
use, and relentless promotion of its logo as part of
the Stones’
identity, generating new and money-
spinning business deals for credit cards,25 fashion
wear, and a wide array of merchandise26—even
folding chairs.27

In 1997, a Stones’ spokesman candidly admitted that
the band ‘lost a lot of money over the years through
people using things like the tongue-and-lips logo’ and
so ‘when people start cashing on their trade marks, the
solicitors step in’.28 The Stones’ trade mark legal team
has been as energetic and dynamic as a Mick Jagger
dance routine, whipping up trade mark policing and
enforcement actions around the world.29 The Japanese
trade mark opposition that formed the basis of the
Uprise IPHCJ case is one example (albeit unsuccessful)
of the brand owner’s trade mark policing measures.

Given the sizeable monetary investment needed to
build such music brands in today’s marketplace,30 we
will analyse the rationale of Uprise, explore whether
the Stones suffered rough justice before the IPHCJ, and
discover lessons that music and entertainment brand
owners can draw from the ashes of the Stones’ abortive
opposition.

Section 4(1)(xv): source confusion
Section 4(1)(xv) of Japan’s Trade Mark Law prohibits
the registration of trade marks that are liable to cause
confusion with goods or
services connected with
another person’s business. This likelihood of confusion
results not only from a misunderstanding that
the
goods are those related to the business of another, but
also from misunderstanding that the businesses related
to the goods are ﬁnancially, organizationally, struct-
urally, or otherwise related. It is necessary to show that
the mark to be protected under section 4(1)(xv) is
‘well known’ among consumers in Japan before the
ﬁling date of the unauthorized trade mark application.
Similarities between trade marks are determined
according to the respective marks’ appearance, pronun-
ciation, and conceptual similarity. When it comes to
decisions on the similarity of trade marks, the idea of
conceptual similarity seems to play only an explanatory
role and is not particularly decisive. Conceptual simi-
larity by itself has not always led to ﬁndings of simi-
larity in trade marks, even where the concepts were
identical (but
the other elements were dissimilar).
While it is possible for a trade mark owner to oppose
or invalidate a junior party’s registration on the basis
of the junior party’s unfair intention, the offending
mark must still be either similar or identical with the
senior mark under section 4(1)(xix) of the trade mark
law.

The controlling Supreme Court of Japan precedent
interpreting the scope of section 4(1)(xv) is L’Air Du
Temps,31 where a defendant obtained in 1986 an
unauthorized trade mark registration for L’AIR DU
TEMPS in the Japanese Katakana script with respect to
accessories. The famed French perfumery, Nina Ricci
S.A., was the rightful owner of a registration for L’AIR
DU TEMPS for perfumes. Nina Ricci ﬁled an invalida-
tion application against
the defendant’s trade mark
registration but
lost. The High Court afﬁrmed the
JPO’s decision, but the Supreme Court overturned the
High Court’s decision, revoking the JPO decision and

providing important interpretative guidelines on the
meaning and purport of section 4(1)(xv), conﬁrming
that it encompassed the concepts of ‘dilution’ and ‘pre-
venting free riding’. In particular, the Supreme Court
held that section 4(1)(xv) was to

prevent ‘free riding’ on and the ‘dilution’ of well-known
and famous labels and protecting the product identiﬁ-
cation function of
trade marks, aims to maintain the
business reputations of those who use the trade mark and
protect the interests of prospective consumers. It follows
from the purport of the provision that in order to protect
the reasonable interests of persons who use labels, includ-
ing those which are well-known or famous, in accordance
with changes in business and markets, including the diver-
siﬁcation of business management, the formation of indus-
try groups bound together through the merchandising of
the same label and the emergence of famous brands, trade
marks that are likely to cause confusion in even the broad
sense should not be registrable.

The question as to whether a trade mark is ‘likely to
cause confusion’ should be considered comprehensively, in
the light of the extent to which the trade mark and the third
party’s label are similar, the extent to which the third party’s
label is well-known, famous or original, the extent to which
the Designated Goods and the Goods connected to the
third party’s business are related in terms of
inherent
characteristics, usage and purposes and the degree to which
the traders and prospective consumers of the Goods are the
same (as those of the Designated Goods) and other business
conditions, using as criteria the amount of attention usually
paid by traders and prospective consumers of the Desig-
nated Goods for the trade mark.

The Uprise IPHCJ case essentially captured and applied
the relevant Supreme Court’s L’Air du Temps 4(1)(xv)
criteria, namely the degree of similarity, the senior
mark’s originality, and the actual status of business
transactions surrounding the businesses of the marks in
dispute. The underlying rationale of section 4(1)(xv) is
that consumers are the ones who must be confused
before the junior
trade mark application can be
rejected. Conceptually, dilution ‘dispenses with con-
fusion as an element’ for trade mark protection, at
least under US law,32 but dilution in Japan is achieved
where marks are protected even without a showing of
competition between the parties under ‘confusion in
the broad sense of the term’.33 Consumer confusion is
still a careful fact-speciﬁc inquiry especially in terms of

the actual status of business transactions which is the
sine qua non for protection against junior marks this
provision.

The IPHCJ’s focus was the nature and sophistication
of the consumer and the business of the relevant goods
and services: this approach is grounded in long-stand-
ing and incontrovertible Japanese trade mark jurispru-
dence:

If the ultimate standard for similarity in trade marks is
whether there is likely to be confusion over their source,
then it is dependent upon the nature of the people who
view them. For example, there are people who have an
interest in the product in question and pay attention to
the trade marks and there are those who are not remotely
interested in the products or the trade marks. There are
highly educated people with a good vocabulary and there
are those with little education and a basic vocabulary.
There are business people who deal regularly with goods
bearing the trade mark and their rivals and those that do
not.
is usually the more sophisticated or educated
groups of people in each of these examples that are less
likely to be confused. Therefore, the decision as to simi-
larity depends on which section of the population is tar-
geted by the goods and services bearing the trade mark.
Proactive standards for similarity need to take the ‘consu-
mers of the goods or services’ into account in accordance
with the aims of the Trade Mark Law.34

It

The unambiguous conclusion from Uprise is that the
average Japanese music consumer possesses a high
degree of search sophistication, and is neither gullible
nor easily deceived. In Uprise, the IPHCJ concluded
that the consumption of music is a considered matter
‘where preference is a high priority’ and the consumer
is one who is apt to spend more time, attention, or
care in making a purchasing decision—and who is thus
deemed less likely to be confused as to the source or
relationship of purchased trade-marked products.

This preference is not surprising in view of the avid
fans’ emotional connection with a performer based on
music, performances, and responses to them. Given the
extreme enthusiasm of Japanese rock-music fandom,35
it is easy to conclude that they possess the ability and
motivation to differentiate the source of goods and ser-
vices, thereby avoiding any consumer confusion.

In fact, the care and attention of Japanese music
consumers noted in Uprise is similar in spirit to an

American record label trade mark confusion case that
held that music purchasers are highly sophisticated and
discerning in distinguishing between two very different
genres of music, jazz and hip hop.36

The Promethean inﬂuences of music on youth iden-
tity37 are teasingly suggested in Uprise by its acceptance
of the clear differentiation and segmentation of the age
demographic rock fan bases of Acid (teenagers to 30
year olds) and the Stones (50 and 60 year olds),
respectively. This demographic divide self-reinforced
the consumers’ preferences, thereby minimizing con-
fusion. Moreover, the IPHCJ believed that rock-music
consumers would know that the mark was synonymous
with the Stones:
it would be inconceivable for the
under-30-year-old fan base of Acid to confuse the
goods and services marketed under the Acid trade
mark with the Stones, and vice versa, in view of this
generation gap. The IPHCJ’s consumer demographic
analysis has echoes of the 1960s’ mantra of ‘never trust
anyone over 30’38 so warmly embraced by the Stones
and their generation.

The IPHCJ’s analysis and ﬁnding concerning the
splintering and segmented Japanese music fan demo-
graphic is consistent with academic cultural studies of
contemporary Japanese music that noted that the ‘com-
partmentalization of consumers into young people and
middle-aged/elderly strata has begun upon the emer-
gence of new genres within Japan’s popular music,
which has continuously incorporated elements from
Western music’.39

The ubiquity and globalization of modern popular
rock music,40 notwithstanding the best efforts of
phenomenal purveyors like the Rolling Stones and the
Beatles, has ‘not translated into a seamless homogeneity
of global culture’.41 Autochthonous musical expression
is still actively produced and consumed—vouched by
sales of the millions of CDs, online music downloads,
and a cornucopia of merchandise associated with

J-Pop, K-Pop, Cantopop, Indopop,42 for example—by a
discerning and grateful fan base.

The music industry has long relied on music genres,
styles, and performers as marketing tools to sell more
recorded music product so much so that they ‘have
come to function in a similar manner
to brand
names’;43 this has created a consumer class that pos-
sesses higher search sophistication with heightened pre-
ferences, thereby less easily confused. Uprise recognized
this reality of contemporary music marketing with
visual kei’s evolution as a subgenre; the fans’ attendant
attraction, afﬁliation, and allegiance to the genre’s iden-
tity is more than sufﬁcient to avoid confusion with the
Stones’ lips and tongue logo.

Under the Uprise reasoning, the consumers’ sophisti-
cation, nature of goods, and transaction milieu—the
essential constituents of consumer confusion—trump
the fame and distinctiveness of the senior mark. Ironi-
cally the more famous or distinctive the senior mark is,
the more unlikely that the potential customers will be
confused or assume that all products and services car-
rying that the junior mark originates from the senior
source. In the absence of consumer confusion,
the
IPHCJ disagreed that the Acid lips logo conveyed con-
notations that are likely to mislead the expert, careful,
and discerning Japanese music consumers into believ-
ing that the goods or services bearing the Acid mark
are connected with the Stones even if they were the
world’s greatest rock band.

Strategic shortcomings of trade mark
oppositions
As noted elsewhere,44 there are many procedural pitfalls
and strategic shortcomings in Japan’s trade mark oppo-
sition regime. The fundamental practice ﬂaw is the
ex-parte nature of Japanese trade mark oppositions45
since, after the opposer ﬁles the opposition brief and

of confusion between two ‘Uptown’ recording labels where one party was

somewhat esoteric market whereas the other party produced large-scale

the JPO issues the reasons for revocation, the ensuing
merit-based JPO opposition examination and sub-
sequent
IPHCJ appellate proceeding is conducted
exclusively between the JPO and the opposed regis-
trant, to the exclusion of the opposer. A losing trade
mark opponent is not entitled to appeal the JPO’s
decision to dismiss the opposition and maintain the
registration.46 At such IPHCJ trade mark opposition
appeals, the concerned parties are either the trade mark
registrant or the JPO, not the successful opponent.
Japan has a post-grant opposition system and anyone
is allowed to ﬁle an opposition against the registered
trade mark; the non-extendable opposition period is
two months.

The IPHCJ exercises supervisory jurisdiction over all
JPO decisions, including trade mark oppositions,47 and
reviews opposition decisions de novo. The IPHCJ gives
the litigants, the trade mark registrant, and the JPO
latitude to introduce new relevant evidence on appeal
but not new issues. This evidence can include newly
found factual evidence, for example evidence of consu-
mer behaviour or confusion, newspaper, or
trade
literature, surveys, references, and
magazine articles,
any other
relevant evidence relating to their case
insofar as it does not change the gist of the issues pre-
viously pleaded in the opposition proceeding at the
JPO.

During IPHCJ appellate proceedings, the opposed
trade mark registrant is likely to take all necessary
measures to overturn the JPO’s revocation decision and
reinstate its registration, whereas the JPO is unlikely to
have the wherewithal, resources, or even the insti-
tutional memory of the opponent to marshal, gather,
and introduce new persuasive evidence to counter the
registrant’s evidence and arguments at
the IPHCJ.
While there is no doubt that the JPO will not be dere-
lict in arguing its case before the IPHCJ, it is likely
that, when opponents are protecting a multi-million
dollar brand they will take a far more aggressive, afﬁr-
mative approach since they have an immediate and
expensive stake in ensuring a positive trade mark oppo-
sition outcome.

In Uprise, the IPHCJ’s factual ﬁnding of the different
demographic fan bases of Acid and the Stones could
have been effectively rebutted by appropriate survey
evidence of Japanese music consumers since there is

anecdotal evidence, albeit American,48 of the Stones’
appeal being cross-generational, rather than limited to
the pensionable age set. Unfortunately,
since the
opponent was not a party to the IPHCJ proceedings,
there was no opportunity to suggest, conduct, or
submit such survey evidence.

Parties can appeal an adverse IPHCJ trade mark
opposition verdict to the Supreme Court of Japan, but
the opponent has no such recourse, not being a party
in the IPHCJ proceedings. If the JPO does not appeal
an adverse IPHCJ decision to the Supreme Court, the
opposition outcome becomes ﬁnal and conclusive
against the opponent. In any event, Supreme Court
appeals are limited to issues of law and are extremely
rare.

An opponent with a multi-million dollar brand is
essentially held hostage to fortune when it initiates
Japanese trade mark opposition proceedings since it
has no right of appeal against an adverse opposition
decision, nor does it has have any brieﬁng or eviden-
tiary input at the opposition appellate proceeding at
the IPHCJ. The opponent’s appellate handicaps are
unique to the Japanese trade mark opposition system
and are not found in the USA, Europe, the UK, or even
the People’s Republic of China which uniformly allow
opponents unfettered and equal access
to judicial
appeals in trade mark opposition proceedings.

Rather than ﬁling an opposition, brand owners are
better served by ﬁling an invalidation appeal (IA). Cur-
rently, there are two co-existing systems, the opposition
and IA, whereby third parties can challenge the validity
of a registered trade mark at the JPO. No procedural
disadvantage or strategic handicap that the opponent

suffers under
the Japanese trade mark opposition
regime is present in the IA. This is illustrated in the fol-
lowing comparison table of similarities and differences:
The IA route before the JPO and IPHCJ is clearly
more ﬂexible procedurally and strategically as the chal-
lenger can fully engage the adversary in the proceed-
ings, ventilate, canvass, adduce, and raise all necessary
arguments and evidence before the JPO and, more
importantly, appeal to the IPHCJ and Supreme Court,
if applicable.

The rough justice suffered by the opponent in Uprise
was largely self-inﬂicted when it opted to ﬁle an oppo-

sition rather than the IA. If Musidor had used the IA
system and invalidated the target registration at ﬁrst
instance before the JPO, the losing registrant could
appeal to the IPHCJ and Musidor would be party to
the appellate IPHCJ proceedings. Musidor would have
been able to brief, canvass all necessary arguments and
adduce any survey or any other relevant evidence to
rebut the trade mark registrant. If Musidor lost at the
IPHCJ, it could even appeal to the Supreme Court of
Japan.

Even though the outcome may not change in light of
the existing Japanese trade mark precedent, Musidor
would have at least gone out ﬁghting and not been a
hapless bystander. The owner of arguably the world’s
most famous rock logo may have been tactically naı¨ve
when it ﬁled a trade mark opposition rather than an IA.

Opposition contrasted with invalidation
appeal
An interesting foil to Uprise would be Berrymobile,49 a
recent IPHCJ trade mark invalidation decision that
involved a famous multibillion dollar brand50 and
which secured a far better trade mark outcome than
the Stones.

The Japanese registrant ﬁled its unauthorized ‘berry
mobile’ trade mark application in June 2006; it was
registered in March 2007. Rather than ﬁling an opposi-
tion, Research in Motion (RIM), the Canadian manu-
facturer of the ubiquitous BlackBerry device, ﬁled an
invalidation appeal in June 2008. After this was dis-
missed by the JPO in June 2009, RIM appealed to the
IPHCJ in October 2009. RIM’s invalidation arguments,
coupled with new evidence, found a more receptive
audience in the IPHCJ, which promptly overturned the
JPO’s decision after only one hearing in March 2010.

Invalidation and opposition statistics
According to statistics gathered from several recent JPO
Annual Reports,51 there has been an unmistakable stat-
istically signiﬁcant trend: opposition rulings are pre-
dominantly given in the registrant’s favour and the
opponent rarely wins.

One can scarcely fail to notice the appallingly anaemic
opposition success rates (only 18.7 per cent for the
cumulative period 2000– 2008) and the ever-diminish-
ing number of oppositions ﬁled year on year (there is
an almost 75 per cent decline from 2000 to 2008).
These two trends are self-reinforcing, as opponents ﬁnd

that they keep losing oppositions, and that there is no
way to appeal such decisions, they will decide to ﬁle
fewer oppositions in future. One possible reason why
the opposition success rates are so low is that parties
were ﬁling meritless, frivolous, or abusive oppositions
and were easily dismissed.

In contrast, the IA success rate (55.3 per cent over
the same cumulative period) is far higher than the
opposition success rate. Also,
the average
deliberation period for trade mark IAs was 11 months,
whereas for oppositions it was 8.9 months.52

in 2008,

Even though there is a precipitous decline in
opposition ﬁlings, oppositions still outnumber IAs. If
indeed the opposition procedure is so ﬂawed, there

should be more IA ﬁlings commensurate with the
fall
in trade mark oppositions. One possible reason
why IA numbers have not increased is cost: opposi-
tions are relatively cheaper in view of
the swifter
and ex parte nature of
Japan’s oppositions. More
brieﬁng is potentially involved at the inter partes IA
proceeding; so it is a slightly more expensive pro-
cedure. However,

mindful of the Japanese courts’ steadfast reliance and

the
bedrock for the determination of trade mark rights
in the marketplace;
the courts will not hesitate to
restrain an opponent’s unjustiﬁed claim for broad
trade mark protection. Uprise is a vivid example of
Japanese courts’ pro-consumer and pro-competition
instincts conﬁrming that they loathe granting broad
trade mark rights to prevent competitive use when
no confusion seems likely.

Uprise underscores the supremacy of consumer con-
fusion for trade mark similarity determination. By having
consumer confusion as the locus of its analysis, Japanese
courts provide the certainty and clarity to reinforce an
equitable balance in the marketplace between the rights
of the owners of senior trade mark holders and the rights
of those seeking to enter the market.

Uprise reafﬁrms the centrality that it places on consu-
mer confusion in its regulation of the trade mark mar-
ketplace. Japanese music consumers, fans, and industry
professionals, are knowledgeable and possess a sufﬁcient
degree of sophistication, reasoning, and preference;
armed with ample observational powers,
they are
neither naı¨ve, nor easily confused by choices between
competing marks—so much so that even the world’s
most famous rock logo cannot always get what it wants.
