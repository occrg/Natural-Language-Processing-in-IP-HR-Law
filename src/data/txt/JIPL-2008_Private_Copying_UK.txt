Does private copying need an update in the UK?

Setting the scene
The European Commission has, during the past 3
years,
studies of
Europe’s state of play on private copying, eventually
deciding to freeze a planned legislative reform on the
ﬁeld.1 ‘Private copying’ generally refers to the act of
representing or duplicating a copyright work for the
purpose of enjoying its use within the conﬁnements
and intimacy of the individual’s private life. Legally, it
is construed as a limitation or exception, depending on
national law, to a speciﬁc form of exploitation that IP
law grants to authors and creators of works of art: their
exclusive right to reproduce the product of their mind.
The right is intrinsically connected to the reality that
copyright holders may not control absolutely the desti-
nation of their works once they have been published.

public has been able to read, listen to, or view a work
for its own education or pleasure.2 The enlightenment
of individuals, to equip them to understand and par-
ticipate in the public decisions that affect them, made
it superﬂuous to require authorization for uses of a
work that serve to educate the public. This has been
the perception in many country’s legal systems: the US
Constitution makes an indivisible association between
copyright and the progress of science and the arts.3

Today, almost every country in the EU has provided
in its legislation for the copying of works for private,
non-commercial purposes. The German copyright
statute of 19014 was one of
to regulate
indirectly the ‘copying for private use . . . in cases where
the purpose . . . was not
to gain income from the
work’.5 Germany was the ﬁrst nation to enact in 1965 a

In October 2004, the Commission consulted Member States on the
scope of the private copying exception and existing systems of
remuneration. A subsequent public consultation was launched in June
2006. On 13 December 2006, a spokesperson for EC Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso announced the indeﬁnite postponement
of the adoption of a draft recommendation on the implementation of
the EU Infosoc Directive aimed at phasing out the private copying
compensation system.

Key issues
† Private copying of copyright works infringes the
right of exclusive reproduction unless either that
right does not go so far as to include acts of that
nature or a defence is provided to an act of
infringement in respect of such acts.

† Although each act of private copying may be
economically insigniﬁcant, the cumulative effect
of such activity is great and raises the question as
to whether the copyright owner is entitled to
some recompense for the effect of such copying
on his expectation of securing remuneration for
the use of his copyright.

† This article reviews, with special reference to the
experience of the European Union and the USA,
the manner in which issues arising from private
copying have been resolved, then focuses on the
ambivalence of UK law.

private copying scheme. Legislative change in Germany
was triggered by two landmark decisions from the
Federal Supreme Court, in 1955 and 1964, regarding
the private recording of music and sounds on tapes.

In 1957, France introduced Article 41 of its Intellec-
tual Property Code, permitting private copying—but
without a correlative right to remuneration. Elsewhere
in Europe, Norway permitted private use of works in
its Copyright Act of 1930, which stated in section 4
that

use the works mentioned in Article 2’.7 In Norway, it

(copies) of works such as ‘recordings on gramophone
discs and tape-recording of music from broadcasting’.8
Speciﬁc mention was made of the then-current fashion
for ‘home-recorders’ and of there being no reason to
prescribe special rules applicable to such apparatus.9

Today, many European countries have established
systems based on levies—compulsory licences—on
media used for private copying which are ultimately
borne by the consumers. The proceeds are distributed
among authors as compensation for their loss of control
of the copies of their works. Most recently in Canada,
the Copyright Board extended levies on media to MP3
players as it regarded these electronic devices as falling
within the meaning of ‘audio recording medium’ under
section 79 of the Canadian Copyright Act which makes
the devices liable to carry a tax for private copying.10

Norway, in contrast with other European countries,
has a government-ﬁnanced private copying scheme
which annually establishes a grant to compensate indi-
vidual right-holders.

In the USA, sound recordings were not protected by
the 1909 Copyright Act. Underlying musical works,
though protected, could nonetheless be distributed to
the public through a ‘compulsory licence’ where
anyone could copy the record on paying a 2-cent
royalty to the copyright owner.11 In 1971, Congress
extended copyright protection to sound recordings, but
owners of copyright in sound recordings in USA only
have an exclusive right ‘to reproduce [their works] and
distribute [them] to the public’.12

The legislative revision discussed the private copying
of sound recordings. The House Report on the 1971
Amendment, in a section entitled ‘Home Recording’,
stated that

restrain the home recording,

. . . the practice is common and unrestrained today, and
the record producers and performers would be in no

The reproduction rights in motion pictures, however,
are not limited to their public distribution. The copy-
right owner’s right to reproduce the work exists inde-
pendently,
in the private sphere too, and the ‘mere
duplication of a copy may constitute an infringement
even if it is never distributed’.14

In the EU, studies were undertaken to examine the
the copyright directive15 in the
implementation of
member states and to gather input from European
stakeholders. This article will give an overview of the
European directive, dealing with private copying and
British responses to it, then considering inconsistencies
prevalent in the current British legislation, by compari-
son with case law in Germany and the USA.

Copyright Directive
The European Union directive on copyright in the
Information Society (Infosoc) states in Article 5(2)(b)
that ‘Member States may provide for exceptions or
limitations to the reproduction right . . .’.16 Thus, the
private copy exemption may be implemented at the
option of each Member State.

reproductions of the copyrighted work if it be a sound recording. . .’.
It follows from this that authors of sound recordings in USA have no
control over the private performance of their works.

ARTICLE

The formulation of a provision which categorizes
copying either as a limitation or as an exception is signiﬁ-
cant, since the choice of wording might lead to different
consequences. If we label the private copying exemption
as a limitation to the reproduction right, we implicitly
recognize that the author’s right has the character of a
ﬁnite proprietary right; any reduction of the monopoly17
right, construed as a legal boundary, would have to
balance the loss of control imposed on the author against
some kind of amortising remuneration to his beneﬁt: we
may infer from the word ‘exception’ that the right has a
speciﬁc reach within its natural borders.18 Limited rights
normally carry conditions. Exceptions rarely do.19 Thus
we understand that a limitation calls for a statutory rule
curtailing a speciﬁc right20 in exchange for a countervail-
ing measure, whereas an exception would not need to
consider redressing the reduced interests of the author.21

Contrary to this view, Sam Ricketson expressed, a`
propos the double character of the exemptions, in a
WIPO standing committee study, the view that pro-
visions excluding protection—in particular works or
material such as ofﬁcial texts,22 news of the day,23 and
speeches delivered in the course of
legal proceed-
ings24—are conceived as limitations of the reproduc-
tion right, whereas permitted uses for the purposes of
research or news reporting are viewed as exceptions.25
The ambivalence found in this approach would create
dissimilar private copying systems across the European
Union where the exemption, when recognized, would
entail either wider or narrower protection of the copy-
right beneﬁciary.

In Norway, for instance, the Copyright Act 193026
included a private use exemption under a chapter

property. HJLPP. 1991; 13: 108– 109. L Lessig, The future of Ideas
(Random House, New York, 2001) 58n.
As opposed to legal boundary.
See to this extent the Berne Convention. Arts 2 bis (2) and 13 which
refer to limitations to rights subsequently mention ‘conditions’. In
contrast, Art 9 (2) lays out an exception but it is not accompanied by
any condition. Article 2 bis (2) says regarding a “possible limitation of
protection of certain works” that “It shall also be a matter for
legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the
conditions. . .”. [Our emphasis] Article 13 (1) states with respect to a
“possible limitation of the right of recording of musical works” that
“each country of the Union may impose for itself . . . conditions on the
exclusive right granted to the author of a musical work. . .”. [Our
emphasis] Lastly, Article 9 on possible exceptions to the right of
reproduction states: “. . .2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the
countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in
certain special cases. . .” but makes no mention of conditions.
It needs an action.
The Webster and the Cambridge dictionaries deﬁne limitation as ‘a
principle that limits the extent of something’ and ‘the act of controlling
and especially reducing something’. Exception is deﬁned as ‘someone or
something that is not included in a rule’ and ‘exclusion’.

entitled ‘Restrictions on copyright law’. In the Copy-
right Act 1961, however, the word ‘limitations’ was
preferred because

the positive rules on copyright [are] the result of two com-
ponents of equal value, the idea of the creator and the idea
of the public . . . Any argument [purporting] that the restric-
tions . . . are [to be viewed] as exceptions which have to be
interpreted strictly or even stringently must be avoided.27

that national

The Infosoc directive says
laws can
restrain the copyright ‘in respect of reproductions on
any medium made by a natural person for private use
and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly
commercial, on condition that the right-holders receive
fair compensation . . .’.28 Commercial copying is thus
forbidden. Various scholars29 have seen in this pro-
vision an absolute prohibition embodying private
copying by or within business enterprises or other legal
persons. However, some European laws, such as the
Norwegian Copyright Act, allow individuals to make
copies of protected material within their business only
for work-related purposes.30

Private copying is a legal solution to the sociological
reality that the use of protected works by the public is
almost impossible to monitor without impinging on
the right to privacy, and the enforcement of copyright
within the private realm is almost unfeasible. Some
authors call this a ‘market failure’
limitation which
makes up for the lack of negotiations between right-
holders, users, and consumers, reﬂecting the unenforce-
ability of copyright in the area.31

exemption is established in national law, concomitant

Ricketson writes that exceptions imply that ‘. . . copyright protection
should not exist in the works in question . . . because of the importance
of the need for ready availability of such works . . .’ and limitations

compensation must be paid. This compensation acts as
an indemnifying remuneration for the authors, produ-
cers, performers, and broadcasters of protected works.

The directive provides guidelines on how the com-
pensation should be determined. Under Recital 35, it
must be ‘adequate’, ‘fair’, and proportional to the amount
of reproduction of copyright material, as we may infer
from the sentence ‘to compensate . . . for the use made
of their protected works or other subject-matter’.32

The basis for calculating compensation
The compensation must be contingent on a priori case-
by-case examination. It must relate to the ‘possible’
harm or prejudice suffered by the right-holder. The
economic damage derived from private copying does
not automatically have to be present or past, but future
and probable.

When the economic effect caused by the private
copying is ‘minimal, no obligation for payment may
arise’.33 For example, the European Commission has
stated that ‘. . . no obligation for payment may arise
regarding certain single, temporary acts of copying a
broadcast work or other subject matter which are
undertaken solely for the purpose of enabling it to be
viewed and/or listened to at a more convenient time
(“time-shifting”)’.34 Some academics35 suggest extend-
threshold to ‘space-shifting’,36
ing this de minimis
which refers to a situation where a user reformats a ﬁle
it owns to enable its use in a different medium, typi-
cally, changing a .wma ﬁle from a CD into a .mp3 to
reproduce it in a portable player.

If right-holders have received payment via a licence

fee,

example, where ﬁles are downloaded from a music
store which licenses their use after payment.

If the copyright work is protected by a technological
measure, for example, the Content Scramble System
used in DVDs, it should not be compensated.

The directive subjects the compensation right to the
famous three-step doctrine37 enshrined in numerous
international instruments such as the Berne Conven-
tion and the TRIPs Agreement.38 The doctrine comes
into play during the ﬁrst procedural step described
above.

Finally, the right of distribution of a work may also
be limited to be in conformity with a private copying
exemption. This may mean in practice that when a
person makes a copy of, for example, a Woody Allen
ﬁlm broadcast by a television channel, the distribution
of that private copy could fall out of the sphere of
control of its owner insofar it regards a certain number
of copies. Most likely, national law could decide that
the copy could be passed on to a small circle of friends
and relatives without the authorization of the rights-
holder.

The UK response to studies
Several British copyright organizations39 and the Patent
Ofﬁce (now the UK Intellectual Property Ofﬁce,
UKIPO) have given Brussels their opinions concerning
private copying. Their responses shed some light on
the differences between legal theory and practice.

Compact Collections,

dealing for private study are the only recognized acts

ALCS, an authors’ collecting society, stated that ‘in
the absence of a remuneration scheme . . . the illegal
private copying of protected works may be seen as a
societal norm’ in the UK.41

DACS, which represents designers and artists, com-
plained that the UK is ‘effectively a country of infringers
that could in theory be sued by copyright owners’42 and
called on the British government to act and ‘introduce
an exception for private copying in order to legalise a
practice that is currently happening’.43

DACS also maintained that the private copying com-
pensation mechanism is created to level out the right-
holders’ lack of control of ‘mass-uses of their copyright
works’, contrary to theorists who preach the market-
failure theory.44

BRM, which collects on behalf of composers and
songwriters, pointed out that the increase in sales of
blank media has not been accompanied by an equivalent
rise in royalties: ‘This appears to be an unsustainable
“lose– lose” equation where most of the UK population
is acting outside the law and creators are not being
remunerated for the ever more widespread copying of
their works’, BRM said,45 adding that private copying
from one physical format to another (‘format-shifting’)
must be compensated as it is an unenforceable right.
The society explained that right-holders lose revenues
from sales of content in new medium forms.46

The Law Society of Scotland commented that ‘there
is an assumption in the United Kingdom that by pur-
chasing copyright material, such as an audio CD or a
ﬁlm DVD, the purchaser has the right to listen to or
view that copyright material in whichever form is con-
venient’.47 However, no ﬁnancial harm was inﬂicted
upon the copyright holders when users shift the format
of protected material.

landmark cases
copying. The
outcome of the ﬁrst, which originated in Germany, had
a signiﬁcant effect on the appearance of copyright
levies in the continent. This case is also important
because judges in Europe have reached a conclusion
that differs from that of their counterparts in the USA,
on similar facts and practically the same rules.

German society for musical authors
In 1954,
the German society for musical authors,
GEMA, ﬁled suit with the Supreme Court against the
manufacturer of
television sets and tape recorders,
Grundig,51 seeking to stop the sale of those products
because they contributed to copyright infringement and
demanding damages.52 Grundig’s promotional material
for the sale of home tape recorders said they were suit-
able for copying music, providing explicit instructions
on their function as well as explanations on how to
record radio broadcasts. Grundig did not, however,
provide any notice to the buyers that music works were
protected by copyright and that it was illegal to record
music without authorization. In its defence, it argued
that copyright did not cover private acts.53

The Supreme Court said the speciﬁc situation could
fall under Article 15.2 of the German Copyright Act
1901 according to a literal interpretation which would
exempt tape recorders from copyright infringement.

that Article; the legislature could not have foreseen sub-

they held that it could not have been the intention to
exclude from copyright protection the private use of a
work of the kind under review. Furthermore, the Court
held, in a conﬂict between creators of works and users,
the former should prevail. Since mechanical sound
recording was not contemplated by the private copy
limitation, Grundig was ordered to sell the machines
with notices indicating the possibility of copyright
infringement.55

Ten years later, GEMA pursued litigation against
electronics retailers in Personalausweise and asked the
Supreme Court to order those retailers to sell equip-
ment with copyright licences, including a remuneration
fee for GEMA.56 This plea, which equated to a request
to establish judicial
liability towards a third party
arising from a pure contractual relationship, clearly
exceeded the powers of the court and would have vio-
lated the principle of division of powers. Thus the
Court did not rule on the question. It did, however,
give its opinion on an issue which GEMA did not raise
regarding the secondary liability of the seller:57 this was
that, since the defendants beneﬁted from the popularity
of home taping, the producers and retailers of recor-
ders were liable for contributory copyright infringe-
ment by providing individuals with the necessary
means to do so.58

From that point onwards, German law established a
statutory licence with levies on media enabling copying
for private purposes as a form of indirect payment for
copyright owners.59

Betamax dealt in particular with the issue of time-
shifting. The Hollywood industry, represented by Uni-
versal City Studios and Walt Disney Productions as
claimants,
to stop electronics manufacturer
Sony selling videotape recorders (VTRs) which, they
claimed, infringed their reproduction rights in enter-
tainment movies. The central district court of Califor-
nia held that this did not infringe and that the fair-use
defence was valid62: the Court said that copyright did
not grant creators ‘a monopoly over an individual’s
off-the-air copying in his home for private non-com-
mercial use’,63 adding that Congress had not antici-
pated giving copyright holders the right to forbid video
recording in domestic premises (‘Congress did not ﬁnd
that protection of copyright holders’ rights over repro-
duction of their works was worth the privacy and
enforcement problems which restraint of home-use
recording would create’).64

The Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit unani-
mously reversed this decision, ruling that the recording
was not fair use and infringed copyright:65 Sony knew
the users’ infringements because the reproduction of
copyright works was clearly ‘the most conspicuous use’
of the VTRs.66 Sony had ‘materially contributed’ to the
infringement of copyright by manufacturing the VTRs,
since the products were sold ‘for the primary purpose
of reproducing television programming’.67

The US Supreme Court subsequently reinstated the
district court’s decision and held that videotaping for
private purposes was fair use.68

The main point of law at stake was the status of
time-shifting. The Supreme Court ﬁrst assumed that
unauthorized time-shifting was illegal, when examining
the hypothetical contributory liability of manufacturers
of equipment capable of infringement use. It concluded
that
there was no contributory liability because

the petitioners had not proven that Sony had actual
knowledge or capability of controlling the infringing
uses made by its customers.69

It then considered whether unauthorized time-shift-
ing did indeed infringe the rights of copyright owners,
reaching a negative ﬁnding. This was mainly because
copyright was limited in scope by its own nature and
could not justify restricting trade, ie the sale of VTRs.

The monopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are
neither unlimited nor primarily designed to provide a
special private beneﬁt.

However, the most important aspect of this case in
my view lies in the dissent of the four remaining
judges, who argued that time-shifting was in reality
private copying and as such was not permitted by the
US statute. The dissent held that the making of even a
single videotape recording at home falls within the
scope of the exclusive reproduction right granted to the
copyright owners in section 106(1) of the code. Time-
shifting was equivalent to private-copying and the law
had not speciﬁcally warranted an exemption for it in
the statute:

. . . The copyright
reward to the owner a secondary consideration.70

like the patent statutes, makes

law,

The Court interpreted, by analogy, case law related to
patents and a provision71 in the Patent Act which
expressly provides that the sale of a ‘staple article or
commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non-
infringing use’ is not contributory infringement:

When a charge of contributory infringement is predicated
entirely on the sale of an article of commerce that is used
by the purchaser to infringe a patent, the public interest in
access to that article of commerce is necessarily implicated.

For that reason, in contributory infringement cases arising
under the patent laws the Court has always recognized the
critical importance of not allowing the patentee to extend
his monopoly beyond the limits of his speciﬁc grant.

. . . A sale of an article which though adapted to an
infringing use is also adapted to other and lawful uses, is
not enough to make the seller a contributory infringer.
Such a rule would block the wheels of commerce.

The staple article of commerce doctrine must strike a
balance between a copyright holder’s legitimate demand
for effective—not merely symbolic—protection of the stat-
utory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage
in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.72

The Court also found that even unauthorized time-
shifting was a fair use under the three-step test, because
the claimants had not provided proof of
future or
potential harm to their rights. Indeed, time-shifting
could be beneﬁcial
for copyright owners since the
recording broadened the audience.73

. . . the VTR user produces a material object from which
the copyrighted work later can be perceived. Unless Con-
gress intended a special exemption for the making of a
single copy for personal use, I must conclude that VTR
recording is contrary to the exclusive rights granted by
106(1), but . . . neither the statute nor its legislative history
suggests any intent to create a general exemption for a
single copy made for personal or private use.74

Indeed, it appears that Congress considered and rejected
the very possibility of a special private use exemption. The
issue was raised early in the revision process, in one of
the studies prepared for Congress under the supervision of
the Copyright Ofﬁce . . . This study found no reported case
supporting the existence of an exemption for private use.75

When Congress intended special and protective treatment
for private use, moreover, it said so explicitly. . . . One such
explicit statement appears in 106 [in respect of perform-
ances] but no such distinction between public and private
uses appears in 106(1)’s prohibition on the making of
copies.76

The judges stated in page 459 that the Betamax is
capable of
‘library-building’, a
form of behaviour whereby a user records a pro-
gramme in order to keep it for repeated viewing over a
longer term. The dissenting judges argued that no
exemption covering home taping was implied in the
1976 Copyright Act.77 They also analysed time-shifting
in the light of the three-step test or fair-use doctrine,
denying that the practice could be excused as non-
infringing under that defence.

Time-shifting was not a productive use of a copy-
right work, as opposed to acts such as investigation,

Recently, the Supreme Court rendered an Opinion where it
reinterpreted the Betamax ruling and suggested library-building could
be a non-infringing use: ‘Although Sony’s advertisements urged
consumers to buy the VCR to “record favorite shows” or “build a
library” of recorded programs, id, at 459 (Blackmun, J., dissenting),
neither of these uses was necessarily infringing, id, at 424, 454 –455’. See

citation, or news reporting which may be involved in
the creation of new works or products.78 The dissenters
also wrote that time-shifting was a commercial use that
harmed copyright holders insofar it deprived them of
the beneﬁts a new market could have for their works.

As one commentator has observed, time-shifting is non-
commercial in the same sense that stealing jewellery and
wearing it—instead of reselling it—is non-commercial.79

Proof of actual harm, or even probable harm, may be
impossible in an area where the effect of a new technology
is speculative . . . Infringement thus would be found if the
copyright owner demonstrates a reasonable possibility that
harm will result from the proposed use.80

The dissent then enumerated a series of ways in which
the market could be affected.

VTR recording could reduce their ability to market their
works in movie theaters and through the rental or sale of
prerecorded videotapes or videodiscs; it also could reduce
their rerun audience, and consequently the license fees
available to them for repeated showings. Moreover, adver-
tisers may be willing to pay for only ‘live’ viewing audi-
ences, if they believe VTR viewers will delete commercials
or if rating services are unable to measure VTR use; if this
is the case, VTR recording could reduce the license fees the
Studios are able to charge even for ﬁrst-run showings.
Library-building may raise the potential for each of the
types of harm identiﬁed by the Studios, and time-shifting
may raise the potential for substantial harm as well.81

They disagreed that time-shifting was beneﬁcial to the
authors and expressly recognized the right of copyright
owners to obtain compensation from the private use of
their works.

. . . The fact that a given market for a copyrighted work
would not be available to the copyright holder were it not
for the infringer’s activities does not permit the infringer
to exploit that market without compensating the copyright
holder.82

Betamax (n 64), pp. 478– 483. Investigation, citation, and news
reporting are productive uses in the sense they may contribute to the
creation of another work, eg an essay, a Pulitzer winning feature. Time-
shifting, according to the dissenting judges was not productive because
it is not a use capable of conceiving something productive which helps
to the progress of arts and sciences. The Opinion said in n. 40
‘Although copying to promote a scholarly endeavour certainly has a
stronger claim to fair use than copying to avoid interrupting a poker
game, the question is not simply two-dimensional.’ The dissenting
judges cited as example of unproductive use photocopying an old
newspaper clipping to send to a friend, p. 482.
Betamax (n 64), pp. 496– 497.
Betamax (n 64), p. 483.
Betamax (n 64), pp. 483– 484.
Betamax (n 64), pp. 485– 486.

Respondents therefore can show harm from VTR use
simply by showing that the value of their copyrights would
increase if they were compensated for the copies that are
used in the new market. The existence of this effect is self-
evident’.83

They then concluded that time-shifting was unfair and
suggested that Sony pay royalties as remedy to the
infringing use,84 since ‘[viewers] are willing to pay for
the privilege of watching copyrighted work at their
convenience, . . . and undoubtedly, most also would be
willing to pay some kind of royalty to copyright
holders’.85

After Betamax courts in the USA held that commer-
cial use and proﬁt making are signiﬁcant factors but
are not sufﬁcient to defeat the fair-use privilege.86

UK copyright law
The UK created a judge-made equitable defence known
as ‘fair dealing’. The defence, made up of principles
which relate the use of a ﬁrst author’s work by a sub-
sequent author without his consent,87 came after the
adoption of the Statute of Anne of 1709 and was even-
tually incorporated into statute law.88 It is generally
believed in the UK that the law did not establish a
private copy exemption similar to those on the Conti-
nent. As the Gowers Report said in its report the UK
Intellectual Property Framework:89

There is currently no provision in UK law for private
copying. . . . The lack of a private copying exception in the
UK makes it illegal, for example, to copy music from a CD
that one has purchased onto a computer or MP3 player
that one has also legitimately purchased. Much of the
British public is unaware or unconcerned that their actions
are prohibited under the law.90

However, a simple look at some provisions in the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA) may
suggest otherwise. First,
section 70—dealing with
time-shifting—authorizes the copying ‘for private and

domestic use of a recording of a broadcast or cable
programme solely for the purpose of enabling it to be
viewed or listened to at a more convenient time’.91 Sec-
ondly, the Act as amended in 2003 incorporates several
limitations to the reproduction right of right-holders
in a chapter dealing with performing rights, discussed
further below.92 Performing rights, often embraced
under the title right of communication to the public,
are not subject to any limitation which takes account of
the private person’s interests for the obvious reason
that the rights only govern the works’ relationship with
the public, not private individuals.

Performing rights, often embraced under the title
right of communication to the public, are not
subject to any limitation which takes account of
the private person’s interests for the obvious reason
that the rights only govern the works’ relationship
with the public, not private individuals.

Also, right-holders have no right to control the com-
munication of their work to an individual
in their
domestic premises. The private person is completely
free to decide which works he plays on TV, radio, and
the internet. Consequently, provisions which deal with
reproduction of works, where performers do have
exclusive rights as recognized in the Infosoc directive,
should not have been included under that set of rules.

Section 17A of Schedule 2 includes a time-shifting
exemption limiting the reproduction and the com-
munication to the public rights: ‘The making in dom-
estic premises
for private and domestic use of a
recording of a broadcast solely for the purpose of
enabling it to be viewed or listened to at a more con-
venient time does not infringe any right conferred by
Part
II in relation to a performance or recording
included in the broadcast.’93 This provision modiﬁes
the reproduction right of performances included in
broadcasts. It also appears to relate to cable pro-
grammes, since section 180 of the CDPA deﬁnes the

recording of a performance as ‘a ﬁlm or sound record-
ing . . . made from a live performance, a broadcast or a
cable programme or directly or
from
another recording of the performance’.

indirectly,

In my opinion, sections 17A and 180 should be read
together. A coherent and systematic interpretation of
the law implies that section 17A should also be read in
combination with the general time-shifting exemption
under section 70.94

The Infosoc directive lays out an exclusive reproduc-
tion right of authors, performers, producers, and
broadcasters, which can be made subject to private
copying limitations. Performers have, according to
Article 2,95 exclusive rights in the reproduction of their
performances. The time-shifting limitations, modifying
the reproduction of broadcasts and cable programmes
in the UK Act, equate to reducing the span of the
exclusive reproduction rights of the four categories of
right-holders mentioned before.

The question is whether time-shifting means the
same as private copying within the scope of the Direc-
tive. The Commission96 has said that that practice
would not require compensation in line with the
de minimis yardstick, but it did not rule out that such
act was private copying.

Is not recording material

viewed or listened to at a more appropriate time,
copying for private use? The dissenting judges
in
Betamax argue that
time-shifting is equivalent
to
copying a work for private use. Further, the CDPA does
not speciﬁcally say that the works have to be destroyed
after they have been watched. This means that users can
copy works for library-building too.97 If we say that
recording movies transmitted or broadcast by Channel 4
or BBC, to watch them when it suits us, is not the same
as copying ﬁlms in private, then when would it be?

private copying.

Betamax relied on evidence that indicated that VTR users mainly ‘time-
shifted’ audiovisual works. The underlying rationale would indicate that
library-building should not be considered a fair use. See n 82 to the
contrary.
Section 182 (1): ‘A performer’s rights are infringed by a person who,
without his consent—(a) makes, otherwise than for his private and
domestic use, a recording of the whole or any substantial part of a
qualifying performance. . .’ [emphasis added].

the whole or any substantial part of a qualifying
performance when it is for his private and domestic
use’. Similarly, section 186 says that it is not an infrin-
gement of a producer’s rights to make a recording of a
performance for private and domestic use.99 Finally,
section 197100 reiterates the terms of section 186.
Therefore, it may be assumed that copying perform-
ances in ﬁlms and songs is allowed in the UK. This
would directly contradict Article 2(b)101 in connection
with 5.2(b), of the Infosoc directive.

Furthermore, sections 56 and 12 of Schedule 2 (regard-
ing performances) deal with copies of protected works
transferred electronically, for example, via the internet.
The sections obliquely refer to format or space shifting
described earlier and resolve conﬂicts between contract
and IP law. By section 56, when a user buys ‘a copy of a
work in electronic form’
licensed ‘on terms which,
expressly or impliedly or by virtue of any rule of law,
allow the purchaser to copy the work . . .’, he can transfer
the copy without infringing any copyright. Section 12 of
Schedule 2 has almost the same terminology: ‘where a
recording of a performance in electronic form has been
purchased on terms which, expressly or impliedly or by
virtue of any rule of
law, allow the purchaser to
make further recordings in connection with his use of
the recording . . . anything which the purchaser was
allowed to do may also be done by a transferee without
infringement’.

These two provisions really say that the contract will
govern the legal relationship between the seller, buyer,
and the copyright holder. If the contract says the work
can be copied for transfer to another medium by the
buyer, it will not infringe any statutory provision. Thus,
when the contract permits you to copy the downloaded
work for format-shifting, as maybe the case with music
bought from some internet sites, you may do so.

The

Store, iTunes, and end users is such an example. The
Apple user agreement entitles the purchaser to ‘export,
burn (if applicable) or copy Products
solely for
personal, non-commercial use’.102 In other words, a
private copy exemption is recognized by contract.

One can argue that sales of CDs which undoubtedly
involve a contract between a seller, a buyer, and a copy-
right holder include terms allowing private copying
‘impliedly’, since no rules to the contrary are provided in
the transaction. Still, the CDPA prohibits in its section 17
the private copying of the music contained in CDs.

Is there a natural disparity between the purchase of
legal

physical and digital goods justifying different
regimes?

Moreover, the provisions also implicitly recognize the
user’s right to transfer or copy a work from one platform
to another to enable its use, as in space shifting.

A private copying exemption exists
In the light of the above, I can only conclude that the
UK legislation has established a private copying exemp-
tion in the CDPA, disseminated through separate sec-
tions but pervading the whole Act. The grant of such
exemption needs to be accompanied by a concomitant
right to compensation for copyright holders to avoid
falling foul of the Infosoc directive.

lawmakers

Accordingly,

should either erase any
mention to time-shifting from the Act, amend pro-
visions regarding copying performances and the section
dealing with transfers of copies of works in electronic
form or, more appropriately, introduce a remuneration
right compensating right-owners for the loss of reven-
ues from the private copying of their works.

recording rights in relation to a performance who, without his consent

domestic use’ [emphasis added]. The provision is referring to
phonogram producers and ﬁlm producers as well as performers who
have assigned their rights.

101 Letters c and d of the Art 2 of the Directive regarding producers would
be infringed indirectly since it is obvious that copying the performance

downloaded from their iTunes internet site with considerable limitations
which hindered buyers from copying the music works in a different

lobbying by consumer organizations, Apple announced it would start
