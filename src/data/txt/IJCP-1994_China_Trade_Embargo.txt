South  China  Morning Post  the  Macau  police  recovered  and  returned  7  rare
Chinese  antiques  worth  Hong  Kong  $20  million  that  had  been  stolen  from
a  museum  in  Kaifeng  City, Henan  Province  in  1992.

vagaries  of  politics  —  for  example,  used  as  a  tool  of  anti-American  propa-
ganda  and,  during the "Great  Leap  Forward",  subordinated  to  the  principle
of  "hou-chin  pao-ku"  ("paying  more  attention  to  the  present  than  to  the

People's  Republic  of China  and the  Illicit  Trade  in  Cultural  Property

12  Historically,  for  African  and  Asian  states  in particular,  the pillaging  of  cul-
tural  relics  was  equated  with  colonialism,  and  the  cultural  property  issue
became  central  to  the  struggle  for  independence.  Gradually,  however,  the
rhetoric  of  anti-colonialism  has  given  away  to  notions  of  "national  patri-
mony" and  even to the relationship  of a state's art treasures to the  "common
heritage of mankind", though still predominantly with a view to nationalistic
protection. See-D. N. Thomason, "Rolling  Back History: The United Nations
General  Assembly  and  the  Right  to  Cultural  Property"  (1990)  22 > Case

18  In  Article  1.
19  The PRC has recognised the need for such facilities:  see, for example, Chap-
ter  IV  of  the  Law  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  on  the  Protection  of
Cultural  Relics  adopted  at  the  25th  Meeting  of  the  Standing  Committee  of
the  Fifth  National  People's  Congress,  November  19,  1982  (hereinafter,  the
"1982  Cultural  Relics  Law"); however  it is extremely  doubtful  whether  suf-
ficient  resources  will  be  found  in  the  near  term  even  to  approximate  the
ideals  and  standards  set  forth  therein. -

20  See K. S. Jore, "The Illicit Movement of Art and Artifact:  How Long Will the
Art  Market  Continue  to  Benefit  From  Ineffective  Laws  Governing  Cultural
Property?"  (1987)  13  Brooklyn  J. Int.  L.  55,  68.  For  criticisms  of  the
UNESCO  Convention,  see  A. P.  Prunty,  "Toward  Establishing  an  Inter-

P. Lalive, supra  at 24, who argues  that the Convention  "shows  a remarkable
lack  of  understanding  of,  or  concern  for,; the  realities  of  comparative  law
and private  international  law".  Indeed, Article 7 does not come to grips with
the  bona  fide  purchaser  doctrine  found  in  the  civil  law  systems  of many  of
the market  and  transit  states.

supra  in  (1988)  21  U. C. Davis  L. R.  477.  Article  4  of  the  1982  Cultural
Relics Law provides that "all  cultural relics remaining underground or in the
inland waters or territorial seas within the boundaries of the People's Repub-
lic  of  China...sites  of  ancient  culture,  ancient  tombs  and  cave  temples...
memorial buildings, ancient architectural  structures, stone carvings, etc. des-
ignated  for  protection  by  the  state...and  cultural  relics  in  the  collection  of
state organs, armed forces, enterprises owned by the whole people and public
institutions  shall  be owned by  the state".

of provinces,  autonomous  regions and  municipalities  within  the  PRC.

32  Contrast  the  situation  of  many  Asian  source  states  with  that  of  the  source
(and  market)  state  of  Japan,  for  example,  whose  domestic  collectors  have
the  resources  to  compete  with  foreign  buyers,  which  has  tax  incentives  to
induce  donations  to the  state,  and  whose  restrictions  on  exports  are  suffic-
iently narrow to make effective  enforcement  feasible,  with the result that the
foreign  market  is  satisfied  generally  through  legal  means:  see  C. F.  Sayre,
"Cultural  Property  Laws  in India  and  Japan" (1986)  33 UCLA  L. R. 851.

34  See,  for  example,  explicit  references  in the  Circular on  Cracking  Down  on
Activities  Involving  Smuggling  and  Illegal  Excavation for  Cultural  Relics,
issued by the State Council  26 May,  1987, which, interestingly,  addresses in

240

People's  Republic  of China and the  Illicit Trade  in Cultural  Property

the same breath the "damaging of state cultural heritage" and the "corrupting
of social values" associated  therewith.  Illicit  traffic  can  occur  at the  official
or  unofficial  level.  During  the  1980s  in  a  bid  for  foreign  currency,  PRC
officials  discreetly  allowed  a  flow  of  antique  pottery  out  through  Hong
Kong. There  is a report  of an  individual  museum  official  in Hunan  province
stealing  over  1800  cultural  relics:  Sun  Fei,  "Using  the  Criminal  Law  as  a
Means of Protecting the Historic .Relics of our Motherland" (1983)  1 Studies
in  Law  1.8, 23.

35  In the PRC as in many source states, the real "source" of relics is the peasant
classes  whose  grave-robbing,  excavations  or thefts  are often  the first step in
a sophisticated  smuggling network.  In  1986 in Henan province, for  example,
peasants .allegedly  robbed  500  graves  dating  from  the  First  to  the  Fourth
Centuries  B. C. Ofcourse,  the "extreme" internationalist  position  holds that
illicit  trafficking  may  be  a  good  thing  in  that  amateur  digs  may  disclose
relics  otherwise  never recovered,  and  smuggling  may  save  works  otherwise
neglected,  thereby  "spreading" culture.

ures  on  the  Administration  of  Export  Verification for  Cultural  Relics,  an-
nounced  by the Cultural  Department  February  27,  1989, article 27, as to the
rather-small  staff  numbers  deemed  necessary  for  a  "verification  unit".  Sun
ft\,,supra,  observes  that  in  many  cases  curators  or  staff  of  PRC  museums
are  simply  unable  even  to identify  losses  after  thefts.

supplement  such  a  regime  with  a  supranational  adjudicative  institution  to
determine  "cultural  significance":  see  Prunty,  supra;  or  a  UNESCO-super-
vised  register  to  be  used,  in  a  manner  similar  to  a  land  register:  see  E. C.

(1982) 9 Syr. J. Int. L. & Comm.  1. An economic analysis would dictate that
it  is more  effective  and  efficient  for the  buyer  or  the  market  state to  police
the  traffic  than  the poor  source  nations:  see  J. S.  Moore, supra  [1988] Yale
