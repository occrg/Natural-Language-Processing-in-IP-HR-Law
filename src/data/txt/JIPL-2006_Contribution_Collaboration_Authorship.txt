Contribution and collaboration in joint
authorship: too many misconceptions
Lior Zemer*

1. Introduction
Joint ownership of authorial and artistic commodities
is a principle which many consider ‚Äòfraught with
problems‚Äô.1 In particular, the vague formulation of
the conditions for joint authorship creates absurd
situations in which, although two or more individuals
contribute to the creation of a product meriting
joint entitlement, copyright ‚Äòrefuses to acknowledge
the existence of
‚Äò‚Äòjoint authorship‚Äô‚Äô, or does so
grudgingly‚Äô.2 The consequences of this practice are
many. They include the denial of ‚Äòeconomic rewards
to persons whose creative efforts satisfy the con-
stitutional and statutory concepts of authorship‚Äô3
and destabilization of the economic incentive-based
rationale to the ownership of intellectual products.

This same formulation also reinforces the concept of
the ‚Äòlone author‚Äô as the sole foundation for copyright
ownership. One commentator highlights the weak-
nesses in the current deÔ¨Ånition of joint authorship as
applied to digital works:

[t]he bad news about the joint work category is that it
seems not to recognise the morphability, flexibility and
fluidity of networked digitized works . . . where mul-
tiple authors of a consciously collaborative work exist,
we encounter legal interpretations of ‚Äòjoint work‚Äô that
are influenced by the cult of the romantic author.4

This article questions the wisdom behind the
present deÔ¨Ånition of joint authorship. It examines
the requirements of collaboration and contribution
and highlights the misconceptions about ownership,
entitlement, and authorship that dominate the way
we perceive and deÔ¨Åne joint authorship. It then sum-
marizes the basic rules for joint title. The impact of
these misconceptions affect the ways courts apply

Key issues
 The creation of a copyright work by two or
more parties is fraught with legal problems,
since the contribution of each may be measured
in both physical and intellectual terms and the
range of solutions offered by the law is nar-
rower than the range of factual situations to
which it applies.

 Joint creation raises issues both in terms of
authorship (ie who in fact created the work?)
and in terms of ownership (ie who is legally
or equitably entitled to the copyright?).

 There is an argument

for

recognizing the
intellectual or emotional contribution in the
creation of a work as having some legal con-
sequences even if it falls short of the classical
definition of joint authorship.

the requirements of joint authorship, creating a prin-
ciple that does not Ô¨Åt the very idea of authorship
copyright aims to protect,
is then debated. After
examining three ‚Äòtest cases‚Äô, the article concludes by
emphasizing the need to achieve more clarity when
deÔ¨Åning contribution and collaboration for purposes
of joint authorship.

2. Establishing joint title
In the event that two or more individuals jointly own
property, the nature of their relationship and the
entitlement of each of
them may be determined
by their agreement. The relationship may take the
form of joint tenancy or tenancy in common.5 Joint

form of
tenancy is considered the more perfect
joint ownership, the joint owners being treated as
an inseparable unit without possessing individual
shares or different parts
in the property. They
together own the entire item. Despite the common
law presumption in favour of joint tenancy, equity
favours tenancy in common, especially in commercial
situations.6 The form of the relationship may be
determined by speciÔ¨Åc words expressed by the parties,
showing their intention to own the property in one
manner or the other.7

The law provides clear guidance in the case of
patents and copyrights, favouring tenancy in com-
mon unless otherwise speciÔ¨Åed by the parties:8 As
the Court recently held in Bamgboye v Reed,

if there are two or more persons who are joint authors
they own the copyright in equal shares, but it is sug-
gested that is not an invariable rule because sometimes
the authors may be joint tenants rather than tenants
in common and in that case until severance there are
no shares.9

tenancies

Also, while

in common and joint
tenancies can exist with respect to real and personal
property, they do not apply to a chose in action.10
Intellectual property must be deÔ¨Åned as personal
property if these forms of joint ownership are to
apply. The law provides that patents and copyrights
are indeed personal property.11

As with personal property, when the nature of
the entitlement of all alleged joint authors to the
copyright is not determined by agreement, the nature

of their relationship may determine it.12 The court
held in Stuart v Barrett that, in the absence of an
agreement between the alleged joint authors, all share
equally as tenants in common, irrespective of their
actual contribution in terms of quality, quantity,
and originality.13
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is for any person who asserts that he/she is a
joint author to prove that he/she has
contributed to the execution of the
copyright work
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Joint authors of a copyright work are its initial
co-owners. However, co-ownership does not neces-
sarily arise from joint authorship. Co-ownership
also applies to situations where, eg a given interest
is transferred or assigned to more than one party or
when the work is created in the course of employ-
ment. My main concern here is how joint ownership
of copyright works arises when the copyright material
is produced by two or more collaborators. Initial
ownership of a work is straightforward: the Ô¨Årst
owner of a copyright work is its author.14 In the
case of works of joint authorship, two or more collab-
orating authors constitute the ‚ÄòÔ¨Årst owner‚Äô.

Joint authorship does not occur automatically.
Copyright law requires authors to satisfy two condi-
tions for there to be a case for joint authorship:
collaboration and contribution to produce a copy-
right work of a single kind ‚Äòin prosecution of a

6 On the difference between the two forms of

joint ownership, see

Thompson, ibid.

7 The principle of ‚Äòseverance‚Äô means that the survival of a joint tenancy will
be determined by certain expressions made by the co-owners from which
we can learn about their intent not to be regarded as a single owner. For
example, statements such as ‚Äòin equal shares‚Äô or ‚Äòto be divided between‚Äô
are regarded as preventing the ownership from taking the form of joint
tenancy. For a brief account see D Hayton, ‚ÄòJoint Tenancies‚ÄîSeverance‚Äô
(1976) 35 CLJ 20.

See CDPA 1988 s 10(1); PA 1977 s 36(1).
9 Bamgboye v Reed [2004] 5 EMLR 61, 74.
10 Choses (or things) are divided into two classes: choses in possession (eg
tangible items capable of being actually possessed and enjoyed, such as a
poetry book or a car) and choses in action (eg a right to recover a debt
that can be enforced by legal action). See Re McKerrell McKerrell v Gowans
[1912] Ch D 648, 650.

11 Under s 90(1) of the CDPA 1988 copyright is transferable as ‚Äòpersonal or
moveable property.‚Äô Complementing this is s 1(1), which provides that
‚ÄòCopyright is a property right . . . ‚Äô; s 30(1) of the PA 1977 reads: ‚ÄòAny
patent or application for a patent is personal property (without being a
thing in action) . . . ‚Äô

Although it is arguable that copyright is a version of chose in action,
courts have found that copyright is clearly chose in possession. See for

example Lauri v Renad [1892] 3 Ch D 402; Redwood Music Ltd v B Feldman
& Co Ltd [1979] 1 RPC 1; Mail Newspapers Plc v Express Newspapers Plc
[1987] FSR 90; and Bamgboye v Reed (n 9 above). See generally,
S Brodhurst, ‚ÄòIs Copyright a Chose in Action?‚Äô (1895) 11 LQR 64; TC
Williams, ‚ÄòProperty, Things in Action, and Copyright‚Äô (1895) 11 LQR 223.

13 Stuart v Barrett [1994] EMLR 448. In Levy v Rutley, the earliest recorded
case on joint authorship, Byles J found joint authorship to exist although
one person had contributed a very small amount of work to the execution.

[1995] EMLR 307. For the patent aspect see Florey and Others‚Äô Patent
[1962] RPC 186, 193.

14 CDPA 1988 s 11(1). There is one exception to this rule: in works produced
in the course of employment, in the absence of an agreement to the con-
trary, the first owner is the employer. CDPA 1988 s 11(2). See eg Acorn
Computers Ltd v MCS Microcomputer Systems Pty Ltd (1983‚Äì85) 4 IPR
214. On this issue see generally, AS Wernick, ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Work Made for Hire
and Joint Work Copyright Doctrines after CCNV v Reid:
‚ÄòWhat! You
Mean I don‚Äôt Own It Even Though I Paid in Full for It?‚Äô‚Äô (1990) 13
Hamline L Rev 287. It should also be noted that under CDPA 1988 s
11(3), 163, and 168, the rule of joint authorship does not apply to Crown
or Parliamentary copyright and to copyright of certain international
organizations.

It is for any person who asserts that he/she is a joint
author to prove that he/she has contributed to the
execution of the copyright work.18 The contribution
should not be separable or distinct from the contribu-
tion of any other collaborator: it must be substantial,
but need not be equal.19 That is to say, each contribu-
tion must be signiÔ¨Åcant, inseparable, and in pursuant
to a common design, and when assembled together,
constitute a unitary copyright entity.20 Where the con-
tributions are distinguishable, the work may qualify
as a collective work.21

The question of signiÔ¨Åcant original contribution
is one of fact and degree,22 as opposed to whether
the parties intended to co-author the work. In the
seminal case of Kenrick v Lawrence the Court held
that sufÔ¨Åcient contribution is established only if an
author contributes to the expression.23 Contribution
to the idea is insufÔ¨Åcient. The simple reason is that

[t]here is no copyright in ideas. Thus, a person with an
original idea is not the author or copyright owner of

Canadian Copyright laws, an intention of the parties to collaborate. I shall
examine the principle of intention in a subsequent issue of this Journal.

18 CDPA 1988 s 10(1).
19 See Stuart v Barrett (n 13 above). Certain copyright works have different
criteria for co-authorship [films, CDPA 1988 s 10(1A), and broadcasts
CDPA 1988 s 10(2)].

20 The Court in Stuart v Barrett mentions these aspects by citing the interloc-
utory decision in Najma Heptulla v Orient Longman Ltd (1988), [1989]
FSR 598 (HC India). Stuart v Barrett, ibid 462. cf Meltzer v Zoller 520 F
Supp 847 (DNJ 1981).

21 A collective work is a work created by two or more that lacks the coales-
cence of the requirements for joint authorship. Contributors retain separ-
ate copyright. CDPA 1988 s 178 provides that a ‚Äòcollective work means:
(a) a work of joint authorship, or (b) a work in which there are distinct
contributions by different authors or in which works or parts of works
of different authors are incorporated‚Äô. The Act does not specify examples
of such works and as such creates unnecessary confusion with what joint
authorship consists of, and may also cause abuse of the copyright system

any work composed by another who makes use of
that idea, unless the person with the idea contributes
to the form in which the copyright exists.24

A court will not Ô¨Ånd joint authorship where it can-
not Ô¨Ånd contribution to the work by way of literary
labour.25 For example, it is not enough that an author
thought up a plot of a play or made suggestions for
scenic effects, catchwords, the inclusion of a comic
routine, the title or leading characters for the play,
or that he/she passes on his reminiscences to a
ghostwriter.26 Furthermore, the contribution must
be made during the process leading to the creation
of a copyright work and not when

the melody was complete, the chord structure was com-
plete, the rhythm or groove was apparent . . . and the
structure . . . from start to finish was already laid out.27

3. Defining collaboration

and contribution

What exactly constitutes sufÔ¨Åcient contribution is
a complex issue,
fraught with conÔ¨Çicting inter-
pretations. In Robin Ray v Classic FM28 the court
was asked to rule on a dispute between a writer and
a broadcaster of classical music against a commercial
radio station as to the ownership of intellectual prop-
erty rights in Ô¨Åve documents. Those documents
contained proposals on how to categorize the tracks
of the defendant‚Äôs music in a catalogue of more
than 50,000 items of classical music compiled by the
claimant over a 5 year period and in a database
containing substantial
the Ô¨Åve
documents and of the catalogue. The Court reiterated

reproductions of

by creating artificial rights of non-contributors while diminishing the
rights of de facto contributors. This matter was considered by the court
in Redwood Music v Feldman (n 11 above). cf US 1976 Copyright Act,
17 USC s 101 and s 201(c) and the Canadian Copyright Act RSC 1985,
c C-42, s 2. Both Acts provide examples for collective works, such as
encyclopaedia, anthology, dictionary, and newspaper.

23 Kenrick & Co v Lawrence & Co (1890) 25 QBD 99. In contrast, the patent
system allows ideas that go to the main principle of the patent to constitute
original contribution that would merit joint inventorship. Smith‚Äôs Patent

the necessary conditions for joint authorship and
emphasized that a joint author is required both to
participate in the writing and to share responsibility
for the form of expression in the literary work under
dispute. Lightman J held,

As regards the five documents and the catalogue, there
is no doubt that . . . there were meetings between the
plaintiff and representatives of the defendant when
discussions took place as to the categories to be adop-
ted and as to the contents of the catalogue, and that
the defendant‚Äôs representatives initiated and developed
a number of ideas which the plaintiff incorporated in
the five documents and the catalogue. But the plaintiff
was solely responsible as author for the writing of the
five documents and the catalogue and the way the
ideas were expressed in them.29

Mere discussions, no matter how valuable they are
for the initiation of ideas, cannot serve as the basis for
copyright protection unless, in the meetings, work
was performed in the tangible Ô¨Åxation of the ideas.
The Court was
sufÔ¨Åciently surprised with the
defendant‚Äôs argument that ideas should sufÔ¨Åce for
contribution to invite the defendant kindly to ‚Äòsay
no more‚Äô, calling his argument a ‚Äòlapse into heresy‚Äô.30
The Court concluded with the assertion that ‚Äòwhat
was required for joint authorship was something
akin to penmanship. What was essential was a direct
responsibility for what actually appeared on paper‚Äô.31
While the ‚Äòsum total‚Äô of the defendant‚Äôs contribution
was in the form of ideas, thoughts, and material com-
municated to the claimant, the latter was engaged
with ‚Äòthe most important input‚Äô,32 namely tangibly
Ô¨Åxing ideas and thoughts.

This strict approach to contribution is in contrast
with an earlier judgment by Laddie J in Cala Homes
v Alfred McAlpine.33 Dealing with joint authorship
of architectural plans, the Court reiterated that skill
and labour are core prerequisites for copyright sub-
sistence and stated that a substantial contribution
of skill and labour is sufÔ¨Åcient for a claim of joint
authorship. However, the fact that ideas are insufÔ¨Å-
cient contribution does not mean that we should
conÔ¨Åne our deÔ¨Ånition of authorship to the person

‚Äòwho pushed the pen‚Äô on to paper. As Laddie J
remarked,

In my view, to have regard merely to who pushed the
pen is too narrow a view of authorship. What is pro-
tected by copyright in a drawing or a literary work is
more than just the skill of making marks on paper or
some other medium. It is both the words or lines
and the skill and effort involved in creating, selecting
or gathering together the detailed concepts, data or
emotions which those words or lines have fixed in
some tangible form which is protected. It is wrong to
think that only the person who carries out the mech-
anical act of fixation is an author. There may well
be skill and expertise in drawing clearly and well but
that does not mean that it is only that skill and
expertise which is relevant.34

This welcome remark of Laddie J contrasts sharply
with what Lightman J says about authorship in Robin
Ray while criticizing Laddie J‚Äôs decision.35 The latter‚Äôs
reference to the important role played by concepts
and emotions suggests that authorship cannot be
reduced to mere physical activity. Although Laddie
J‚Äôs remarks underscore the dependency on contribu-
tions from other sources when we create a concept,
they invite criticism for running the risk of conveying
a deÔ¨Ånition of authorship which traditional copyright
law does not support. One may argue that sufÔ¨Åcient
‚Äòskill and expertise‚Äô requires something closer to cre-
ative input‚Äîa higher threshold than ‚Äòskill
labour
and judgment‚Äô‚Äîand, as we know, creative input is
an alien concept in English copyright jurisprudence.

Laddie J clariÔ¨Åed his reasoning in Cala Homes in
Flyde Microsystems v Key Radio Systems.36 This case
turned on whether support in testing and debugging
software, including consultation on a regular basis
in the course of developing software with speciÔ¨Åc
technical functionality, merited joint authorship or
an implied licence to use the software. Dismissing
the argument for joint authorship, Laddie J clariÔ¨Åed

of CDPA 1988 section 10(1) is not to turn someone
who is not an author into an author37 and the fact
that one can learn enough about the other‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld of
expertise to allow them to interchange ideas ‚Äòdoes
not turn a person into an author of the software
even when the contributions took a lot of time and
were very valuable‚Äô.38 Laddie J reaches this conclusion
through his distinction between authorial skill and
labour, and mere skill and labour. While the former
may sufÔ¨Åce as contribution for joint authorship the
latter, no matter how time-consuming and valuable,
is not enough.39

Vaver criticizes the restrictive application of the
requirement of contribution and remarks that ‚Äòwhat
contribution warrants co-authorship may be conten-
tious‚Äô.40 He gives the example ‚Äòwhere A supplies B
with all the ideas for the plot of a play and B turns
them into a Ô¨Ånished work‚Äô.41 Drawing on this
example he then explains the Ô¨Çaw inherent in the
existing rules of joint authorship:

still

that

This collaboration [between A and B] has sometimes
not counted as joint authorship unless A‚Äôs ideas were
independently copyrightable‚Äîa result that may pro-
mote certainty but
seems hard. There
would have been no play at all without A‚Äôs input. To
elevate B‚Äôs contribution and entirely discount A‚Äôs
may discourage some fruitful collaborations. It may
also undesirably invite a minute examination and dis-
section of who said and did what, often long after the
event when memory is unreliable. Any substantial
intellectual contribution to a work‚Äôs composition pursu-
ant to a common design should, in principle, count as
co-authorship.42

A line of recent cases restates the rule that con-
tribution must be signiÔ¨Åcant and linked to the
expression, showing how arbitrary and subjective
the assessment of contribution can be. They render
legitimate contribution irrelevant. In Beckingham v
Hodgens the Court of Appeal was asked to rule on
the Ô¨Ånding of joint authorship of a recording of the
Bluebells‚Äô song ‚ÄòYoung at Heart‚Äô between a profes-
sional Ô¨Åddle player and the leader of the Bluebells.43

Dismissing the appeal, the Court agreed that the par-
ties collaborated in furtherance of a common design
but did not satisfy the requirement of inseparable
contribution. The court
invited musicologists by
both parties, which conÔ¨Årmed that the violin part in
the song‚Äîthe cause of the claim‚Äîwas more memor-
able than any other part of the song. The court
upheld the trial judge‚Äôs decision: ‚ÄòHaving heard the
piece played, and reÔ¨Çected on the evidence given,
we conclude that the violin part does make a signiÔ¨Åc-
ant and original contribution of the right kind of skill
and labour to the Bluebells‚Äô version of the song.‚Äô44

That confusion dominates the deÔ¨Ånition of sufÔ¨Å-
cient contribution in joint authorship is further sup-
ported by the decision in Hadley v Kemp, where the
Court found that 9 per cent of the duration of
a musical track was, despite its attractiveness, not
enough to qualify a saxophone interlude as a signiÔ¨Åc-
ant and original contribution;
‚Äòthe saxophone solo
was only 16 bars in length and occupied under
9 per cent of the duration of the recording. Accord-
ingly the third plaintiff was not a joint author‚Äô.45 In
Beckingham the court did not base its decision on
the duration of the violin part but chose to follow
an expert‚Äôs opinion that the part is merely ‚Äòmore
memorable‚Äô. It seems that in Beckingham the court
applies an objective quality-based test, as opposed to
a subjective, rather arbitrary, test in Hadley v Kemp.
Which test guarantees greater legal certainty?

In Bamgboye v Reed the Court reiterates that con-
tribution to musical works is a matter of degree.46
But, as in Laddie‚Äôs opinion in Cala Homes, the court
was looking for something close to ‚Äòcreative contribu-
tion‚Äô concluding that Bamgboye made a signiÔ¨Åcant
creative contribution to the musical work.47 Although
it seems that the court might have established the
beginning of the Ô¨Årst English ‚Äòcreative-step‚Äô require-
ment, something akin to the US decision in Feist,48
this was unnecessary for matters of copyright sub-
sistence. Citing in full the test for joint authorship
as laid down in Robin Ray the Court again demon-
strated how arbitrary the test for contribution is,49

Ô¨Ånding that a contribution of 33 per cent was
sufÔ¨Åcient creative contribution since it related to the
creation of the musical work and not to its inter-
pretation or performance.50

The rules on joint authorship under the CDPA
1988 substantially differ from their US counterpart.
This, however, does not mean that the latter works
better. As Dreyfuss observes,
joint
authorship eliminates the possibility that certain con-
tributors . . . will be protected by the statute‚Äô.51

‚Äòour policy of

Thus it is argued that the US Copyright Act of 1976
does injustice in the case of sound recordings and
rock music as it does not recognize the complexity
of creating a sound recording,52 or that rock music
is a group phenomenon.53 According to section 101
of the 1976 Act, a joint work is a ‚Äòwork prepared
by two or more authors with the intention that their
contribution be merged into inseparable or inter-
dependent unitary whole‚Äô. It seems that section 101
mirrors section 10(1) of the CDPA but with two
main differences: the requirement of intention and
the component of interdependency.54

In Thomson v Larson the Second Circuit rejected a
claim of joint authorship while leaving open the ques-
tion of whether a contributor of copyright material
retains an independent interest as the author of his
contributions.55 Although the agreement between
Thomson and Larson said nothing about copyright,
the collaboration between them brought about a
new creation: their joint work resulted in complete
rewrite of the Rent play script. The question was
whether Thomson‚Äôs and Larson‚Äôs creative contribu-
tions rose to the level of joint authorship.56 There

exist two different approaches to this question. One
is that of Nimmer; the other is that of Goldstein.
Nimmer argues that each contribution should be
‚Äòmore than de minimis‚Äô or that ‚Äòmore than a word
or line . . . be added‚Äô.57 Goldstein asserts that each
contribution must be independently copyrightable.58
Although the joint authorship rules under the 1976
Act do not embrace a Goldstein-like condition,
common law has created the rule that, to qualify as
a joint author, the contribution must be copyright-
able. Goldstein‚Äôs approach attempts, as the Court
held in Childress v Taylor, to ‚Äòcarefully draw the
bounds of joint authorship so as to protect the legit-
imate claims of both sole authors and co-authors‚Äô.59
Can we carefully draw these boundaries by strictly
applying rules that ignore contributions made by
others? Although under English law the require-
ment
for contribution is closer to Nimmer‚Äôs de
minimis approach, both systems require copyright
contribution and embrace, although on a different
scale, Goldstein‚Äôs approach. This approach seems
wrong. First, it discourages authors from creating or
providing other creators with valuable ideas, and risks
chilling ‚Äòthe creative process‚Äô.60 As Vaver remarks, it
denies contributions without which the work would
not at all exist.61 Second, it strengthens the status of
the sole author.

formulated the
level of contribution the Court
‚Äòlinking sequence‚Äô test, stipulating that the signiÔ¨Åc-
ance of the contribution should be judged in light
of the role of a speciÔ¨Åc and isolated sequence to the
whole work.63 We propose to examine two of the
six songs: ‚ÄòMocking Bird‚Äô and ‚ÄòGaladriel‚Äô. In the Ô¨Årst,
the Court followed the general test for co-authorship
in a manner similar to that which led to the decision
in Cala Homes.64

‚ÄòMocking Bird‚Äô was composed of

three verses,
ensuing choruses and a four bar solo guitar passage,
which was referred to as ‚Äòthe sequence‚Äô. The Court
evaluated the sequence and its inner arrangement
and referred to the parties‚Äô disagreement regarding
authorship of the sequences‚Äô most important element:
a four-note descending harmonic line. In examining
this element, the Court referred to the timing of
writing the harmonic line, its repetition, and original-
ity, remarking that the sequence, arranged with vari-
ous orchestral and band overlays, was occasionally
repeated throughout the song and formed the basis
of the climax of the work.65 However, since the Court
found that the parties‚Äô contribution was merged and
was inseparable,
it did not base its decision on
authorship of the harmonic line and viewed the
song as a unitary whole composed by both parties.

In ‚ÄòGaladriel‚Äô, a 48 bar work, the Court employed
the ‚Äòlinking sequence‚Äô
test. Although the main
orchestral contribution formed only one-eighth of
the work‚Äôs bar-structure66 it was found to be the
cause for the work‚Äôs great success.67 In ‚ÄòGaladriel‚Äô
Godfrey did not dispute that the song was Lees‚Äôs
masterpiece and that he had no hand in the composi-
tion and structure of the song because it was a com-
pleted work when he was introduced to it. What
Godfrey contributed was the orchestral arrangement
of the recorded version. This contribution,
it was
argued, was the result of the collaboration between

ive input.‚Äô (n 28 above) 636.

64 Cala Homes v Alfred McAlpine Homes (n 33 above).
65 ibid.
66 ibid 328. Applying different rules on what amounts to the necessary signi-
ficant contribution shows the arbitrary nature of the rules on contribution.
In Beckingham v Hodgens the court called experts to decide on whether the
contribution was sufficient (n 43 above); in Hadley v Kemp the court found
nine per cent not to constitute significant contribution (n 27 above); and
in Bamgboye v Reed, 33 percent were found sufficient creative contribution
(n 9 above).

establish is that he has made a significant and original contribution to the

Godfrey and Lees. Basing its decision on the six bar
sequence, the Court held that contribution should
be examined by its intrinsic quality:

The main orchestral contribution to the work is in
bars 24 to 29 of this 48 bar work. Those bars form a
linking sequence and constitute an integral part of
the work. In my view the plaintiff‚Äôs contribution is
sufficient
in importance and originality to qualify
him as a joint author of the work. The fact that
when composing the six bar orchestral link the plaint-
iff took the basic melodic and harmonic lines from the
song does not deprive the plaintiff share in the author-
ship of the work in the form in which I heard it. The
link passage is, to my ear, an original and cleverly
worked adaptation of the song‚Äôs melodic line.68

The requirement of quality, not quantity, meant
that a minimal percentage of bars might be enough
to constitute original contribution to the expressive
form of a song and thus render it a work of joint
authorship. Moreover, the basic ingredients of copy-
right protection‚Äîskill, labour, and judgment‚Äîwere
found by Blackburne J to be determined not merely
by the amount of labour expended on the creation
of the whole work but by the amount of labour and
skill expended on the ‚Äòlinking sequence‚Äô.

(2) Neudorf v Nettwerk69 and Brighton v Jones70: In
Neudorf the Supreme Court of British Columbia dis-
missed the claims of a musician, Neudorf, for joint
authorship of four songs, including ‚ÄòVox‚Äô, attributed
to the singer McLachlan, who had had a recording
contract with Nettwerk. At issue was whether the
contribution made was signiÔ¨Åcant, although it need
not be in equal magnitude. Neudorf maintained that
he alone contributed the rhythm, that McLachlan
dictated from his part of the hook melody ‚Äònote for
note‚Äô and that the vocal melody and the chord struc-
ture resulted from their collaboration.71 The defence
position was that the hook melody was already pre-
sent in the guitar chords McLachlan was playing
and Neudorf merely replicated the melody using

creation of the work . . . . It is not necessary that his contribution to the
work is equal in terms of either quantity, quality or originality to that of
his collaborators.‚Äô ibid 325. However, it is not clear from Hadley v Kemp
whether significant is a quality-based test or quantity-based test: ‚ÄòIt would
be surprising if a slight contribution was enough to make a person a joint
author and thereby make him an equal owner with another or others who
had contributed far more than he had‚Äô. Hadley v Kemp, ibid 643.

violin sounds.72 Is a violin version of a guitar style
melody, not sufÔ¨Åcient
to constitute contribution?
Cohen J stated,

In my opinion, the plaintiff has failed to establish that
he contributed original expression to the hook melody
of ‚ÄòVox‚Äô. The G-C to G-A melody was an expression,
but it was not original. The four-chord guitar progres-
sion is especially clear in the introduction of the song,
and one can easily hear the G-C to G-A melody that is
then replicated and used as the violin hook melody in
the song. In my view, what the plaintiff did was copy
the melody in MaLachlan‚Äôs chord progression . . . 73

The defendant was playing the guitar while
Neudorf was in the studio. It appeared that both
parties were inspired by the contribution made by
the other, which was how the Ô¨Ånal version of ‚ÄòVox‚Äô
evolved. Regarding the chorus vocal melody, Neudorf
said he selected notes for the melody:

The song ‚ÄòVox‚Äô originated with both myself and Sarah.
She started playing some chords. I selected some
notes from what she was playing, provided a rhythm
to it that ended up being the riff. From here I came
up with the drum bit on the drum machine and Sarah
kept playing along, playing along.74

He did not deny that it was ‚Äòquite feasible to
say . . . that had I not been in the room at
the
time, Sarah would have continued meandering and
continued to meander and perhaps come up with a
different chorus‚Äô.75

Although it might have been equally powerful as a
chorus it would not be the same as with his contri-
bution since it was his selection that changed the
direction of the song and made it into the chorus
that it subsequently became.76 The Court, however,
held that Neudorf‚Äôs contribution fell short of the legal
standard for original expression.77

The Court next examined the contribution to the
verse vocal melody and the chord structure, Ô¨Ånding
that the contribution made to both was insigniÔ¨Åcant
to merit joint authorship. With respect to the con-
tribution to the verse vocal melody, Neudorf con-
tended that he and the defendant
‚Äòwere tossing
ideas back and forth‚Äô and recalled that they were

72 ibid 576.
73 ibid 577.
74 ibid 578.
75 ibid.
76 ibid.

‚Äòcollaborating on things‚Äô.78 As Neudorf put it, ‚Äò[i]t‚Äôs
very much an interactive process‚Äô.79 True, ideas or
suggestions do not amount to signiÔ¨Åcant contribu-
tion. They may be seen as mere elements of causal
relations. It would be difÔ¨Åcult and impractical to
claim that all creative causal relations initiate legitim-
ate authorial entitlement. However, joint authorship,
as I argue in this paper, is different from individual
authorship. Causality in joint authorship should
play a more signiÔ¨Åcant role in determining the contri-
butions of parties to the interactive creative process.
True, the risk inherent in this argument is that it
might deter authors from collaborating with each
other. On the one hand, if authors would be able to
anticipate that one or more parties may be jointly
entitled to the property in the fruits of their collab-
oration, they would prefer to avoid collaboration
and seeking the advice of fellow authors. This will
have a far-reaching effect of the creative process
which copyright law aims to secure and maintain.
On the other hand, many works of art and authorship
are dependent on collaboration. In the present case,
since both contributors simultaneously agree to join
efforts and perform in the studio at the same time,
provision of creative ideas and suggestions, and inter-
action combined with physical performance, should
sufÔ¨Åce for contribution.80

Neudorf‚Äôs contribution can be deÔ¨Åned using the
terms redirection, integration, and replication. While
redirection and integration mean that one either leads
a work of a certain kind in new directions or unites
two or more sources that previously are seen as unre-
lated into a unitary whole, replication is a form of
passive contribution through an act that leaves the
work where it is at present. It seems that Neudorf
provided original input, which took ‚ÄòVox‚Äô in new
directions. For this reason his contribution was not
less
to the overall
musical appearance of ‚ÄòVox‚Äô. Perhaps the ‚Äòlinking
sequence‚Äô test in Godfrey v Lees81 should be extended
to cover situations where unpersuasive contributions
should be reviewed in light of their quality and over-
all impact, which in ‚ÄòVox‚Äô greatly beneÔ¨Åted the end
result.

Lior Zemer ¬∑ Contribution and collaboration in joint authorship

The nature of the collaboration between Neudorf
and McLachlan and their unfortunate results are sim-
ilar to the situation involving a playwright and dir-
ector in the English case of Brighton v Jones.82 Jones
was commissioned to write the play ‚ÄòStones in his
Pockets‚Äô; Brighton was its director. The latter‚Äôs con-
tribution was found insigniÔ¨Åcant:

although everyone agrees that changes were made to
the script as a result of experience in the rehearsals,
no-one can bring to mind at this distance in time
(eight years after the event) specific details of any of
the changes.83

interpretations, and exchange of

Although the court recognized Brighton‚Äôs import-
ant input in the rehearsals, which came from her
strong personality as an experienced theatrical dir-
ector,84 it rejected the claim of joint authorship, there
being insufÔ¨Åcient contribution. The Court held that
her contribution was merely in the form of discus-
sions,
thoughts.
Although ‚Äòchanges resulted from the experience of
the rehearsals and the discussions in the rehearsals‚Äô,85
and although Brighton was ‚Äòinvolved in the rehearsals
throughout‚Äô and ‚Äòshe probably knew about all the
changes before they were made and played‚Äô, the Court
found that in terms of the dialogue of the Ô¨Ånal ver-

that, applying the reasoning of Cala Homes, Bright-

person might be a joint author, even if he had not
himself put the pen to paper and another had effect-
ively written what he had created.87 This being so, it
was wrong to measure Brighton‚Äôs
contribution
on the basis of whether she pushed the pen and for

the Court to reach a conclusion that one party can
contribute something close to ‚Äò100 per cent words
spoken‚Äô.

Vaver warns us to avoid the tendency to leave
authorial contributions unrewarded.88 Neudorf and
Brighton v Jones are examples of situations in which
without the contribution of the party who was not
recognized as a joint author the disputed work would
have been less successful. It seems that copyright laws
consistently deny authorial contribution. In fact, con-
tributors are not only unrewarded for their contribu-
tion but it seems that‚Äîfollowing Court‚Äôs decisions
on joint authorship‚Äîthe copyright system heads
towards an even more stringent conception of sole
authorship in which the singular author
reigns
supreme and the role of any other joint contributor
is increasingly regarded as non-existent.

5. Conclusions
Contributions that merit joint authorship should be
distinguished from what is required for sole author-
ship. When two or more collaborators decide to
join efforts in furtherance of a preconcerted joint
design, they knowingly participate in a process that
would yield results only if their efforts are combined
together; the test for signiÔ¨Åcant contribution should
be interpreted in light of the shared responsibility
collaborators hold for the resulted type of the expres-
sion, whether by virtue of pushing pen on paper or
adding other mental
labour in the guise of ideas,
concepts, and relevant substantial suggestions. As
Laddie J remarks in Cala Homes,

[i]t is wrong to think that only the person who carries
out the mechanical act of fixation is an author. There
may well be skill and expertise in drawing clearly and
well but that does not mean that it is only that skill
and expertise which is relevant.

We should instead value the contribution of
‚Äòdetailed concepts, data or emotions‚Äô and distinct
‚Äòexpertise‚Äô.89 If we eliminate invaluable mental con-
tribution, we may end up devising a deÔ¨Ånition of
joint authorship embedded with misconceptions and
arbitrary and subjective rules as to what amounts to
signiÔ¨Åcant contribution. That would not only severely

diminish the contribution made by non-joint authors
but also destabilize the incentive system so well
ingrained in our vision of copyright. As they stand
today, the rules governing joint authorship are just

another brick in the wall of our strong and unbal-
anced conceptions of solitary authorship.
