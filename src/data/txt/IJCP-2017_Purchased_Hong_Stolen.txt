 

“Purchased in Hong Kong”: Is Hong Kong 
the Best Place to Buy Stolen or Looted 
Antiquities?
Steven Gallagher*

 

Abstract: The looting of antiquities from archaeological sites has received widespread 
coverage in the media. Concerns about the loss of heritage have resulted in 
international multilateral and bilateral agreements intended to prevent the illicit 
trade in looted antiquities. China has suffered from the looting of its archaeological 
sites for centuries, but the problem has been exacerbated in recent years because of 
the increased demand for Chinese antiquities and the consequent sharp increase 
in market prices. China has requested international assistance to combat the illicit 
trade in its heritage. It is strange therefore that one of China’s special administrative 
regions—Hong Kong—also one of the world’s major art markets, retains a “legal 
absurdity,”1 which may protect the buyer of stolen or looted goods from claims 
for the return of stolen items. This statutory provision may result in the bizarre 
outcome that goods stolen from a museum or looted from an archaeological site and 
then purchased from a shop or market in Hong Kong may be protected from claims 
for their return; this protection may apply even if the loser is the Chinese state.

INTRODUCTION

Although the global art market has seen a cooling of demand in recent years in response 
to economic and financial concerns, the market for Asian art and antiquities, and, 
in particular, Chinese art and antiquities, continues to have strong demand and 
produce record sale prices. This is evidenced by the frequency of “Asia week” events

held by auction houses and dealers around the world and by the released sales fig-
ures from the major auction houses. There are two main reasons for this strong 
market: Asian art and antiquities have long been, and remain, coveted by Western 
museums and collectors, but the increased demand for Asian art and antiquities, 
and Chinese art and antiquities, in particular, has also been fuelled undoubtedly by 
the economic rise of the People’s Republic of China. As with the people of many 
emerging economies, wealthy Chinese citizens are keen to celebrate their heritage 
and culture. Consequently, many of China’s new wealthy elite are using their new-
found wealth to evidence their cultural appreciation and for investment purposes. 
Some have also been driven by patriotic recognition of the devastation that occurred 
to China’s cultural heritage in the past under colonialism and during armed conflict 
to buy back their heritage for private or public collections. Unfortunately, another 
aspect of the appreciation of Chinese art and antiquities, which is of grave concern 
to the Chinese state, is the usefulness of such property to launder money and aid 
capital flight, moving funds out of Mainland China in contravention of the strict 
monetary controls in place for Mainland Chinese citizens.

The demand for Asian art and antiquities is not only limited to Chinese art 
forms but also extends to art and antiquities from throughout Asia—for example, 
India, Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Again, 
art from these states has long been appreciated by collectors in the West, but the 
burgeoning economies of these states and the concentration of wealth in the hands 
of individuals has seen domestic and regional demand increase and drive the inter-
national market.

THE HISTORICAL LOOTING OF ANTIQUITIES IN CHINA

Unfortunately, the problem of illicitly obtained and traded antiquities has existed 
since man began collecting. In ancient China, wealthy scholars would collect antiq-
uities that had been taken from tombs. In Europe, the few celebrated examples, and 
many legends, of China’s artistic products were prime motivators in the sixteenth 
century to send trading expeditions to Asia, taking advantage of improved naviga-
tional and shipbuilding techniques, which made such adventures feasible, if still 
hazardous. As the Chinese valued their own art and did not always consent to its 
sale and export, there was always an illicit market for Chinese antiquities to meet the 
demand from collectors and connoisseurs in the homelands of the colonial powers. 
Looting of archaeological sites may have been carried out by impoverished locals 
who supplied those Chinese merchants who were keen to meet this demand. At other 
times, looting was carried out on a semi-official status by forces under the flags of  
foreign colonial powers—for example, the infamous looting of the Old Summer  
Palace in Peking and the Yuanmingyuan Garden (the Royal Garden of Perfect 
Brightness) in 1860 when the palace was overrun by British and French forces.

After World War I and the beginnings of the end of formal colonial exploitation 
in China, Chinese scholars claimed that looting was continuing under a form of

academic colonialism with foreign-sponsored archaeological expeditions and museum 
collecting missions, which returned antiquities to museums and universities in 
Europe, the United States, and Japan. For example, in 2016, it was noted that Sven 
Hedin, the Swedish explorer and archaeologist whose career spanned from the 
end of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century and who discovered 
the ancient city of Loulan in 1900, had sent most of his important archaeological 
finds back to Sweden until his 1926 expedition when outcry from Chinese scholars 
forced Hedin to compromise. In response to the concern that foreign academics 
were removing antiquities, China’s first laws to protect its archaeological heritage 
were proposed in 1935 under the Republic of China entitled Rules Relating to the 
Participation of Foreign Academic Organisations and Private Individuals in the  
Excavation of Relics.2 Of course, the looting of archaeological sites on a casual or 
directed basis has always been carried out by local residents just trying to provide 
for their families, with little concern for the ruins of the past and simply keen to 
exploit the tastes of collectors whether domestic or foreign—a practice that con-
tinues today.

THE CAUSES OF THE ILLICIT TRADE IN ASIAN ANTIQUITIES

From the early 1990s, the increased demand for Asian art and antiquities has 
not  only  fuelled  the  legitimate  market  but  has  also  fuelled  a  trade  in  illicitly 
obtained and exported antiquities.3 Today, Asia’s wealth of heritage is a problem 
for those trying to prevent looting of antiquities as there are so many sites and 
they are often of such a size and extent that they are difficult to physically protect.  
Sites may extend onto private land, and local residents may be poor subsistence 
farmers who see more direct benefit in the sale of artifacts than in the protection 
of their heritage for the interest of wealthy compatriots or tourists. The relatively 
low incomes of citizens combined with the relatively large sums available for these 
items has led to the large-scale looting of known sites and treasure hunting for 
other sites.

Other factors that may contribute to the loss of heritage today include the lack of 
protection afforded by legal and regulatory systems, as protecting heritage has not 
always been seen as a priority in legislation, and even if laws are in place to protect 
heritage, they may not be easy to enforce. In addition, government, local adminis-
trators, and law enforcement may lack the will to enforce these laws, and there may 
also be complicity in looting and export by central and local government officials 
and military and law enforcement personnel, as the latter are often poorly paid 
and have the manpower and logistical capabilities to move substantial antiquities

relatively easily across the porous borders of Southeast Asia.4 There have even been 
recorded instances of theft by low paid archaeologists from sites and museum staff 
from museums.

Most Asian states have now enacted protective laws and regulations for their 
heritage. These are usually based on the general “found-in-the-ground” rule, which  
holds that any antiquities discovered in the state are the property of the state, as well as 
imposed strict restrictions on the export of art and antiquities. Many states in Asia 
are also parties to international agreements intended to counter the trade in illic-
itly obtained and illicitly exported antiquities and have implemented educational 
programs to emphasize the importance of heritage to the local people. However, 
the looting of archaeological sites in Southeast Asia continues to be a problem. 
The problem in Southeast Asia may also have been exacerbated as international 
attention on the looting of archaeological sites and the trafficking of antiquities has 
focused on the destruction of archaeological sites in the Middle East and the plun-
dering of sites by terrorist organizations such as Daesh (also known as the Islamic  
State of Iraq) to fund their operations.5 Understandably, but unfortunately, this  
international focus may have diverted the gaze and concerns of international agencies 
away from the problems in Southeast Asia. Although the international agencies 
involved in trying to prevent the illicit trade in antiquities may not have realized 
that their gaze has shifted from Southeast Asia, it has been claimed that the terrorist 
groups and illicit marketers they are targeting are aware of this, as it has also been 
suggested that the focus on the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas has made 
Asia the preferred trafficking route for looted antiquities from the Middle East.

LOOTING IN, AND THE ILLICIT EXPORT OF ANTIQUITIES, FROM CHINA

The problem of looting and the illicit export of antiquities has been a particular 
problem for the People’s Republic of China. It is impossible to know how much of 
China’s archaeological heritage was looted and exported during the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries. In the nineteenth century, China suffered under the incom-
petence of the Qing Empire, internal strife, and attempted rebellions and colonial 
exploitation. In the twentieth century, the country struggled with internal conflicts 
and invasion, including the First Revolution (1911), the Second Revolution (1913), 
the time of the warlords, the civil war between the Nationalists and the Commu-
nists (1927–49), and the invasion by the Japanese before and during World War II. 
Many treasures were looted and lost during these terrible times. With the Communist 
Revolution and success in 1949, country began to focus on the future rather than 
on the evidence of the past, and when Mao launched his disastrous Cultural Rev-
olution (1966–76), much that remained of China’s heritage in public or private

collections was destroyed or looted and sold off. So great was the loss that some 
commentators have noted that the Nationalists actually saved much of China’s 
heritage from destruction by the Red Guards when they carried off many of the 
treasures from the imperial collections in Beijing and Nanjing in their retreat 
to Taiwan where it now resides in splendor in Taipei’s National Palace Museum.6
From the early 2000s, the Chinese government began to recognize the economic 
value of heritage tourism and encouraged its citizens to holiday at home and enjoy 
the heritage of China rather than leaving China to spend money in other countries.7 
The Chinese government has also recognized the political value of asserting the 
wealth of its art, antiquities, and cultural heritage as part of its national identity. 
In 2015 during a trip to Shanxi province, President Xi Jinping identified antiquities 
as part of the great revival of China, urging local cultural administrators to “let 
antiques speak” since this would strengthen national pride and the country’s sense 
of history.8 This economic and political recognition has resulted in a sea change in 
government policy with a new commitment to heritage represented by unprece-
dented spending on museum building and extensive domestic legislation intended 
to protect heritage.9 The Chinese government has also encouraged heritage activism 
internationally—for example, with regard to underwater cultural heritage in the seas  
surrounding China and further afield and, domestically, by styling itself as “the cradle 
of intangible cultural heritage.”10

However, the problem of looting in archaeological sites is ongoing in China. 
Before the recent boom in the domestic market for Chinese antiquities, David 
Murphy has noted that statistics from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics indicated 
that over 40,000 tombs were reported plundered in 1989 and 1990 alone.11 Murphy 
notes that the looted antiquities were then destined for export through the “transit 
states” of Hong Kong and Macau and that China’s customs and excise service has 
claimed to have intercepted 70,000 pieces bound for these jurisdictions since the 
early 1980s. Apart from these clandestine archaeological excavations, a significant 
proportion of the outflow of antiquities from China comes direct from museum 
thefts and even thefts from government facilities used to store pieces confiscated 
or surrendered to the state.12 There are accounts of details and photographs of

important relics in Chinese museums being faxed to dealers in anticipation of later 
“delivery” through theft and smuggling networks.13

With the increased interest in, and demand for, Chinese antiquities, the prob-
lems of looting in China have only worsened. News stories have highlighted the 
problem by publishing estimates from within China that there may be as many as 
100,000 full-time tomb raiders in the country.14 Such figures mean that claims of 
law enforcement success, as in the detention of 175 people as alleged tomb raiders 
in May 2015 when 1,000 police from six provinces recovered 1,168 artifacts worth 
more than 500 million yuan in China’s biggest antiquities trafficking case since the 
founding of the People’s Republic, may be a mere drop in the proverbial ocean. 
The Chinese authorities have signaled their determination to protect their heritage 
with the severity of the penalties that may be applied to those caught looting or 
illicitly exporting antiquities. The death penalty is no longer freely applied to these 
crimes, but, in 2016, 25 tomb raiders were sentenced for their activities in Liaon-
ing province. The leader and four others were given life sentences, with terms of 
between 3 and 15 years for the other gang members.15

In response to concerns that Chinese auction houses were facilitating the illicit 
sale of antiquities that had disputed provenance as they may have been looted 
in the past from China, the State Administration on Cultural Heritage issued 
regulations in October 2016 on its website to “ban domestic auctions of Chinese  
cultural relics that were looted illegally in history.”16 The new regulations banned 
the  auction  of  “historically  looted  Chinese  relics”  and  introduced  a  priority 
for the Chinese government to buy these items from those who had consigned 
them to auction at an agreed price.17

As mentioned before, another concern for the Chinese government is the use of 
art and antiquities for money laundering and capital flight. As art and antiquities 
may be small, of relatively high value, and easily transported past customs offi-
cials who do not have the specialist knowledge required to distinguish precious 
objects from cheap imitations, they are a useful method for Chinese citizens to 
avoid the country’s strict monetary controls. Money laundering may be perpetrated

using legitimately obtained art and antiquities and stolen and looted items. The 
usefulness of art and antiquities to hide and move black money has always been an 
important factor in demand not only in Asia but also in Europe and the Americas—
for example, the use of pre-Columbian artifacts to facilitate drugs deals and money 
laundering has been well documented.18 In response to this threat, the Chinese 
government has placed more restrictions, including anti-money laundering regu-
lations, on the auction houses and sales in Mainland China.

In addition to its attempts to prevent money laundering and capital flight generally, 
the Chinese government has also indicated to its two special administrative regions 
(SARs), Macau and Hong Kong, that they should assist the Mainland in dealing with 
these problems. This has resulted in a downturn in Macau’s casino revenue and further 
regulation of Hong Kong’s financial and banking industries. However, Hong Kong’s 
art and antiquities market continues to operate in an unregulated fashion.

HONG KONG’S ART AND ANTIQUITIES MARKET

Hong Kong has long been recognized as a major market for Asian art and antiquities. 
Its position in the market has benefited in recent years from the increased demand for 
Asian art from Mainland collectors, thus justifying the Fine Art Asia Fair’s claim that 
“Hong Kong is the established hub of art business in Asia.”19 Hong Kong’s success as 
an art market is based on a number of factors. The British colony of Hong Kong was 
founded because of its natural harbor, and its geographical position is very useful for 
trade in the Asia-Pacific region. A legacy of colonial rule is that Hong Kong is a free port 
with little or no duty payable on goods coming into or out of Hong Kong or passing 
through its efficient logistics system. The ease of travel into and through Hong Kong 
for visitors also makes Hong Kong a convenient entry or exit point for Mainland China 
and overseas collectors and dealers. Hong Kong also benefits from its SAR status with 
the “one country two systems” commitment until 2047, which means that Hong Kong 
retains its common law jurisdiction and the principle of the rule of law, encouraging 
faith in commercial transactions and consumer rights. Thus, buyers of art and antiq-
uities can feel reassured that the courts of Hong Kong will uphold their rights using 
established common law principles to enforce contracts and deals with fakes, forgeries, 
and misrepresentations. Hong Kong’s proximity to the Mainland and the established 
art and antiquities market has made it a target for attempts by the international art 
and antiquities trade to secure part of the seemingly insatiable and immensely lucrative 
Mainland Chinese market. It is also very easy to establish a business in Hong Kong 
for locals, Mainland Chinese, and foreigners. This ease of establishment in Hong 
Kong, coupled with the restrictions on the major non-Chinese auction houses that

are based in Mainland China, has meant that many auction houses have established 
offices in Hong Kong, including notably two of the largest, Christie’s and Bonham’s.
However, Hong Kong’s art market has proved embarrassing for China as the 
country has changed its public attitude to its heritage. During the heated argu-
ments surrounding the attempt by Christie’s in Paris in 2009 to sell two bronze 
fountain heads of a rat and hare looted in 1860 by the British and the French from 
the zodiac fountain of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, it was noted that the 
last auction sales of any of the fountain heads had taken place in Hong Kong in 
2000.20 At that time, Christie’s offered the monkey and ox heads, and Sotheby’s 
offered the tiger head. The Chinese authorities criticized these sales, focusing on 
the involvement of businesses from the former colonial powers, which furthered the 
humiliation of the colonial exploitation of China by the sale of its looted heritage. 
However, the successful buyer of the heads was the Poly Art Museum in Beijing, an 
outcome that led Beijing to state that such purchases should not take place in the 
future at the risk of legitimizing such sales.21

Beijing’s embarrassment with the Asian antiquities trade has been further fuelled 
by the realization, as previously noted, that capital flight and money laundering 
operations have often been facilitated using highly valued, easily moved, and easily 
sold art and antiquities. Although Mainland auction houses have been subject to 
more stringent regulation to attempt to combat these abuses,22 the art and antiq-
uities market in Hong Kong remains largely unregulated and may have benefited 
from the restrictions on the sale of art and antiquities in Mainland China because 
of a transfer of demand. The lack of regulation in the Hong Kong antiquities mar-
ket is of further concern because Hong Kong has also long been identified as a 
transit and market state for the illicit trade in antiquities obtained from Mainland 
China and elsewhere in Asia.23 All of the factors that make Hong Kong a major 
international market for legitimately obtained art and antiquities also make it ideal 
for those involved in the illicit trade—for example, its geographic position, well-
established logistics infrastructure, and free port status.

Although the United Nations has estimated that the illicit trade in antiquities 
ranks third internationally behind drugs and firearms, it is very difficult to obtain 
figures on the illicit trade in art and antiquities.24 It seems fair to assume that the 
boom  in  the  legal  trade  in  art  and  antiquities  brings  an  associated  boom  to  the 
illicit trade in looted antiquities to meet demands that the legal trade cannot meet. 
When China had more restrictive laws on the export of art and antiquities, Hong 
Kong was often identified as a convenient port to smuggle items out of the Main-
land and into the major art markets. However, anecdotally, it has been claimed

that, while Hong Kong was a British colony, there was often cooperation between 
customs officials in Hong Kong and in the People’s Republic of China to attempt 
to prevent some of this trade with seizures of smuggled artifacts on the border 
as they were passing into Hong Kong or the seemingly more common unofficial 
policy of Hong Kong’s colonial officers to refuse to allow these items to enter the 
colony across the land border with Mainland China so that the traffickers would 
be apprehended as they returned.25 Unfortunately, it seems that the rate of success 
for seizures has actually fallen after the handover. In 2010, in response to an enquiry 
for statistical data on the seizure of Chinese antiquities, Customs and Excise could 
only provide details of one seizure in 2006 of 638 pieces of “Arts & Craft (antique),” 
with an estimated value of HK$ 2.3 million. In 2016, the reply to a similar enquiry 
was that Customs and Excise “did not keep such figures.” It may be postulated 
that this indicates that no antiquities are being smuggled from the Mainland into 
Hong Kong, but it is submitted that this is unlikely. In fact, Hong Kong has been 
described by a local senior police officer as a “way station for much of China’s 
exported artifacts on their journey to collections abroad.”26

There have been well-documented cases of Hong Kong’s involvement in the sale 
of China’s stolen treasures. In 2002, “the Buddha of Infinite Life,” an artifact that 
had been stolen by a Chinese museum security chief in Chengde, China, was sold 
at auction in Hong Kong for US$295,000.27 Also in 2002, a Xi’an antiquities dealer, 
Wang Cangyan, was arrested after he had arranged for the transport of dozens of 
figurines looted from the tomb of Empress Dou to Hong Kong, smuggling them 
across the border in a consignment of modern porcelain.28 Some of the figures were 
returned by the shopkeeper in Hong Kong, and some were discovered on sale at 
Sotheby’s in New York and subsequently returned, but many were never recovered.
More recently, in 2015, a Dutch antiquities collector lent a Song Dynasty (960–1279) 
gilded Buddha statue to the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest. The 
figure was X-rayed to reveal the remains of a human body inside. The consequent 
publicity led to claims that the statue and the mummified monk inside had been in 
a temple in the Fujianese village of Yangchun in southeast China. The villagers of 
Yangchun claimed that their statue was stolen in 1995. The villagers, backed by China’s 
State Administration of Cultural Heritage are claiming the statue back. The collector 
has not provided any receipt for the purchase of the statue, and, at present, the only 
provenance is the claim that the collector was shown that he saw the statue in late 1995 
in Amsterdam after a businessman had “purchased it at a market in Hong Kong.”29

Hong Kong has also been used for the trafficking of art and antiquities from 
other Asian states and as a source state when those trying to legitimize stolen or 
looted art or antiquities are trying to manufacture provenance to disguise the 
checkered past of stolen or looted items. Evidence of its usefulness as a trafficking 
waypoint was uncovered in the investigations into the activities of Manhattan art 
dealer Subhash Kapoor, when it was discovered that many of the 3,000 artifacts 
identified as having been looted from India, Pakistan, Cambodia, and Tibet had 
been transported by Law Shang, a logistics operation in Hong Kong, as part of 
their journey to Europe and America.30 The use of Hong Kong as a source state in  
manufacturing provenance was also evidenced in the case of the Kushan Buddhas, 
which had been looted from archaeological sites in India (one of which was returned 
to India by the National Gallery of Australia in early 2016). As part of the attempt 
to hide the illicit source of the Buddha, a letter had been provided purporting to 
show that the Buddha had been purchased by a British collector in Hong Kong.31 
Hong Kong’s role in the illicit trade in art and antiquities is further encouraged by 
deficiencies in Hong Kong’s legal and regulatory framework.

HONG KONG’S LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEM

Hong Kong has a common law legal system. The colony of Hong Kong was ceded 
in perpetuity to the British in 1842 by the first of the so-called “unequal treaties,” 
the Treaty of Nanking. The British established a common law system that was expressly 
retained by Hong Kong in its Basic Law (Article 8) when it was returned to China 
in 1997.32 As a common law system created under British rule, it has many aspects 
of British law in its legislation and common law. However, from its founding as a 
colony, Hong Kong’s law has been developed in line with the law of England except 
where this was “inapplicable to the local circumstances.”33 Thus, laws were intro-
duced that recognized local Chinese custom and that restricted the application of 
English law in the colony.

Unfortunately, one transplant from England that was not considered inapplicable 
was the statutory provision that is known as “market overt.” This is a notorious 
English concept, sometimes described as “an obsolescence,” a construct that granted 
buyers good title to property they had purchased subject to the practices of the mar-
ket they were attending if they had acted in good faith.34 Intended to provide con-
fidence and protect buyers at mediaeval markets in England, it now serves to protect 
those purchasing multi-million dollar art and antiquities in Hong Kong.

Market overt was abolished in England in 1995 by the Sale of Goods (Amendment) 
Act 1994 because it had long been recognized as encouraging the trade in stolen 
goods and had been described as a “thieves’ charter.”35 Market overt is a rule of law 
that provides if a buyer purchases stolen goods in open market subject to the cus-
toms of that market, which usually includes the purchase being during the hours 
of daylight36 and for a reasonable price, the buyer obtains good title to the goods.37 
In England, the privilege of market overt was afforded markets created under grant 
or prescription. By the early 1990s, there was one notorious market where the rule 
was regularly invoked and that was Bermondsey Antiques Market in London.38 
After a long campaign by police officers and concerned citizens, Parliament abol-
ished the anachronistic provision in England. However, the rule of market overt is 
still in existence in Hong Kong, enshrined in section 24 of the Sale of Goods Ordi-
nance.39 In fact, the rule is wider in Hong Kong than it was in England because it 
applies to any shop or market in Hong Kong as long as the goods are of a type that 
would be sold during the normal course of business in that shop or market.40

WHY DOES MARKET OVERT MAKE HONG KONG THE BEST PLACE TO 

BUY LOOTED ART AND ANTIQUITIES?

In 1993, David Murphy highlighted the lack of legal and regulatory protection 
afforded looted antiquities in Hong Kong. As a major art and antiques center, it 
might be expected that Hong Kong would have a well-developed legal and regula-
tory framework to ensure the integrity of such business conducted in Hong Kong,  
but it does not. China is a party to both international conventions intended to com-
bat the trafficking of illicitly obtained art and antiquities—the 1970 Convention  
on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer 
of Ownership of Cultural Property, which was ratified in 1989, and the 1995 
Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects, which was ratified

in 1997—but Hong Kong is not a party to either convention.41 As Emiline Smith 
has noted, China maintains very stringent export laws when it comes to cultural 
property, whereas Hong Kong does not have any import restrictions other than 
those relating to cargo manifestation: “This creates a convenient gap between the 
national legislations of two countries, one which some participants in the cultural 
property trade more than happily make use of.”42

Unlike many jurisdictions today, Hong Kong does not treat what international 
law would consider to be cultural property, cultural objects, or cultural heritage 
as being different from any other form of property. Hong Kong has only one law 
that mentions cultural heritage, the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance, 
and this law is intended to protect Hong Kong’s heritage from damage from con-
struction projects—somewhat unsuccessfully, it may be argued.43 There are also 
building and development-related laws that focus on protecting the built heritage 
of Hong Kong. The only ordinance of Hong Kong that is intended to offer protec-
tion to antiquities is the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance, which is intended 
to protect archaeological sites, antiquities, and relics, but only those antiquities and 
relics that have been discovered in Hong Kong.44

Thus, the only laws of Hong Kong that may be of use to counter the trafficking of 
illicitly obtained antiquities are laws intended to affect all property—for example, 
offences in the Theft Ordinance, the common law, or possibly violations of cus-
toms manifest requirements.45 Therefore, if looted antiquities have been imported 
into Hong Kong and are discovered in Hong Kong, the possible offences that might 
be prosecuted, apart from a failure to declare such imports on an import manifest, 
are as follows. If a thief or looter is caught in Hong Kong, then he may be prose-
cuted for theft even if the goods were stolen in another jurisdiction,46 as long as the 
taking of the goods would constitute an offence in that jurisdiction.47 Possibly of 
more use in the fight against the trafficking of illicitly obtained antiquities would 
be a prosecution for handling stolen goods. This would be possible if anyone was 
proved to be in possession of goods, or to have been in possession of goods, that 
had been stolen in another jurisdiction and it could be proved that the possessor 
knew or believed that the goods were stolen when he obtained them.48 The Hong 
Kong police may search for and confiscate any goods found on the thief or handler, 
or in the premises in which they are detained, if they believe they are relevant to the

investigation,49 or if they obtain a warrant, they may search the premises and make 
relevant confiscations.50 On conviction of anyone for the theft of the goods or for 
handling stolen goods, the court may make an order for the return of the goods 
to the original owner if they have been found or for a compensation amount to be 
paid to the legal owner from the funds of the thief.51

However, even if no criminal prosecutions are brought and the stolen or looted 
goods are identified in Hong Kong, the original owner may use a basic rule of the 
common law to seek recovery of their goods. This is a simple rule of ownership that 
makes it difficult to sell stolen property; it is a maxim or principle of the common 
law that “nemo dat quod non habet” (“no one may give what he does not have”).52 
Therefore, even if a thief sells stolen goods to a buyer who has no knowledge they 
are stolen and the buyer pays a fair price for them, believing the thief to have the 
right to sell them, the buyer cannot obtain “good title”—ownership that defeats the 
claim of others, including the original owner—as the thief does not have good title 
to pass on. The original owner may then be able to rely on the tort of conversion—
the principle that no one may use another’s property as their own unless they have 
permission to do so—to recover the stolen goods. An action in conversion may be 
successful in forcing the purchaser to return the stolen item even when the pur-
chaser has acted in good faith and has paid a fair price for the item. Therefore, the 
original owner may reclaim the stolen goods from the purchaser. The purchaser’s 
recourse is to try to get their money back from the thief under the principles  
of contract law, which is always dependent on whether they can find the thief 
and if the thief has any money. The rule will apply to all subsequent purchasers 
as no one can sell with good title since the thief could never pass this to the first 
purchaser.

When stolen property is recovered, after it has passed through the hands of many 
good faith purchasers, there is a whole chain of aborted sales that may result in liti-
gation to recover purchase monies. The nemo dat rule applies in most common law 
jurisdictions, although it may be subject to time limits for recovery. In Hong Kong, 
the rule has been incorporated into section 23 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance and 
is not subject to a time limit, although the original owner may have to bring the action 
for conversion within six years of first discovering the present possessor of the 
item, if the present possessor is not the first purchaser from the thief.53 Therefore, 
any goods stolen or looted in any jurisdictions where such actions are a crime may 
be subject to an action for recovery under the tort of conversion in Hong Kong 
since stolen goods, no matter when the theft occurred, are subject to the general

principles of the common law and to certain statutory exceptions in the Sale of Goods 
Ordinance—for example, the seller has the power of sale granted by court order or 
by common law or statutory provision and sale under voidable title.54

The nemo dat rule is therefore a useful tool in preventing the illicit trade in antiq-
uities in Hong Kong as purchasers should be wary of losing their purchases if they 
have not undertaken rigorous due diligence procedures. However, Hong Kong’s 
incorporation of market overt in its Sale of Goods Ordinance may allow purchasers 
to relax their due diligence. The rule of market overt in Hong Kong may provide 
that anyone buying stolen art and antiquities from a shop or market in Hong Kong 
where they are openly on display and where such goods are usually sold would be 
able to keep the goods and would not be subject to an action for recovery by the 
original owner if they had no knowledge of the defects in the goods’ provenance 
and have acted in good faith.55 In this case, “good faith” is clarified as something 
done honestly even though it may have been done negligently.56 The rule should 
be effective even if the looted item is taken to another jurisdiction that does not 
recognize the rule since the issue of ownership should be decided according to the 
principles of the conflict of laws, and the law governing the transfer of ownership 
would be the law where the transaction took place (lex situs). Thus, if an item were 
stolen in the United Kingdom, brought to Hong Kong, sold to a shopkeeper or 
market trader in Hong Kong, purchased from a shop or market in Hong Kong by a 
buyer in good faith, and then taken by the buyer back to the United Kingdom, the 
original owner in the United Kingdom would not be able to claim the stolen item 
back since Hong Kong’s market overt rule would have created good title for the 
purchaser, even though the United Kingdom has abolished the market overt rule.57
This remnant of mediaeval English market law was included in the law of Hong 
Kong to protect buyers at a time when travel and communication within the colony 
was not easy and buyers would find it difficult to check the provenance of goods. 
If buyers could not buy freely without concerns over title, then commerce would 
have suffered. This reasoning echoes the original problem with which the mediae-
val rule was created to deal—a problem that existed for all legal systems. If items 
are  stolen  and  sold,  how  does  the  law  decide  ownership  and  apportion  loss? 
Menachem  Mautner  describes  the  problem  thus:  “Here  we  meet  the  Eternal 
Triangle of the Law: an honest man (A), a rascal (B), and another honest man (C). 
Typically, the rascal imposes upon both of them … and leaves the law the problem 
of deciding which of them shall bear the loss.”58

For our purposes, the triangle may involve a rascal who is the original thief or 
looter or the handler or receiver of stolen or looted goods. The rascal steals or loots

the goods or buys them knowing they are stolen or looted and sells them to the 
honest buyer. If the items are identified as stolen or looted while in the posses-
sion of the honest buyer, the law now has to decide whether the honest buyer 
may retain them or whether they should be returned to the loser. Factors that 
should not be considered by the law, but which may affect the policy behind 
the  law,  are  the  lack  of  care  taken  by  the  original  owner,  the  availability  of  
insurance to cover the loss, and the desire to protect the good faith purchaser 
and promote trade without the hindrance of detailed due diligence procedures 
for dealers and purchasers.59

CONCLUSION

Sadly, Hong Kong’s reputation as an international art and antiquities market is not 
matched by its legal framework to prevent the jurisdiction being used as a market 
or transit state for stolen or looted art and antiques. It has been suggested that it 
would require a major overhaul of Hong Kong’s legal and regulatory system and 
a major shift in government policy, as expressed to law enforcement and customs 
officials, to adequately protect the rights of original owners. However, simply 
abolishing the “legal absurdity” of the market overt rule would do much to remove 
doubts over Hong Kong’s reputation as a legitimate art and antiquities market.60 
The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong recommended this in 2002 noting 
that “[a]ll major jurisdictions in the common law world have either abolished or 
rejected at the outset the market overt rule.”61

The market overt rule has no place in modern Hong Kong where it is relatively 
easy to pursue due diligence. The knowledge that a buyer has little to worry about 
even if goods are discovered to be stolen after purchase and even if he has not 
actively pursued enquiries about the source of the goods may cause buyers to 
decide not to bother with any due diligence procedures. Furthermore, if honest 
buyers might be tempted to relax their guard, it is quite easy to see that those not 
so worried about legitimacy might see the rule as a useful tool to establish good title 
to goods that have been purchased with knowledge of their checkered past since 
knowledge of the troubled history of art and antiquities may be very difficult to 
prove and good faith, as has already been noted, is something done honestly even 
though it may have been done negligently.62

Some commentators have argued that the rule plays an important part in bal-
ancing the rights of the good faith purchaser and those of the loser, arguing that 
the owners of items should take more care or should insure their property and

noting “that the policy objective underpinning the market overt rule is to promote 
trade in goods.”63 However, this is based on the idea that the good faith purchaser 
is more deserving of protection than the loser of property who does not protect it. 
Furthermore, as noted by the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong, “[i]t is unre-
alistic to expect an owner to be able to find his lost goods by searching the shops 
and markets of Hong Kong.”64

It is also inappropriate for a modern financial and commercial center such 
as Hong Kong, with extensive and rigorous due diligence measures in place for 
its financial and banking industries and keen to exploit its position and enhance 
its reputation as one of the world’s leading art and antiquities markets, that it 
should retain this archaic and anachronistic rule from mediaeval England. This is 
especially ridiculous when the same rule has been abandoned in England because 
of fears of enabling “a thief’s paradise.”65 The retention of the rule may lead to 
embarrassing issues over the ownership of stolen art and antiquities and will only 
serve to promote illicit trade rather than reaffirm confidence in the legitimacy 
of Hong Kong’s art and antiquities market. The abolition of the rule will place 
the risk of acquiring stolen art and looted antiquities squarely on the buyer and, 
thus, promote due diligence in dealers and purchasers. If a good faith purchaser 
does buy stolen or looted art or antiquities from a shop or market in Hong Kong, 
he or she will be able to recover the purchase monies from the dealer unless he 
cannot find the seller, which would imply a degree of casualness and a lack of due 
diligence on the part of the purchaser.

The failure to follow the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong’s recommen-
dations in 2002 illustrate the slow process of law reform in Hong Kong generally 
and the lack of political will for change in this area. At present, the only hope for 
reform would be an indication from Beijing that such a move was desired, which 
would likely ferment rapid action, as was evidenced in 2016 with the moves to 
legislate to abolish the ivory trade in Hong Kong following Beijing’s lead. There 
are limits to the market overt rule as it cannot be relied on by the owner of a 
shop or market stall who purchases goods from someone bringing them to their 
premises.66 It also would seem doubtful that “shop or market” would include an 
auction; thus, purchasers from the international auction houses holding a sale 
in Hong Kong may have to be more careful than those purchasing from a shop  
or market in Hong Kong. However, if the consignor of a work of art or an antiq-
uity  has  purchased  the  piece  from  a  shop  or  market  in  Hong  Kong,  he  or  she 
will have good title and will be able to pass this to the purchaser in the auction 
sale. It may be coincidence, but the Kushan Buddha that was returned to India 
by the National Gallery of Australia in early 2016 had provenance to a supposed
