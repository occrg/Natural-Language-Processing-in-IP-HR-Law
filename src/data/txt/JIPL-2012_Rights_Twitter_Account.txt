Who has the right to a Twitter account

account

Celebrities, politicians, and the media—and activists
of all kinds—are increasingly aware of the power of
being able to communicate simply and rapidly with a
potentially vast number of people. For businesses, this
can translate into enormous commercial value.

While many brands operate a corporate Twitter
account, individuals who are employed by or in some
way associated with a particular brand (especially in
the entertainment, fashion, media, and sports indus-
tries) may be personalities in their own right and can
have their own substantial Twitter following. In these
cases, the corporate brand feeds off and grows with the
personal brand, but it is also vulnerable to the personal
brand walking out the door.

When an individual with a large personal following
moves from one company to another, perhaps to a
competitor, what happens to the individual’s Twitter
following: is it an asset that belongs to the departing
employee’s former employer or can he take his Twitter
account with him to his new company?

This question was highlighted when Laura Kuenssberg,
the former BBC chief political correspondent, left to join
ITV and shortly after changed her Twitter account
name—with its over 60,000 followers—from BBCLauraK
to ITVLauraK. ITV News said that her Twitter following
was an ‘additional beneﬁt’ of hiring her.

A similar situation arose when CNN anchor man
Rich Sanchez was ﬁred. The Sanchez Twitter handle
named @RickSanchezCNN attracted over 140,000 fol-
lowers. This may not have signiﬁcant value to CNN,
but again highlights the question as to who owns the
Twitter account, and whether a dismissed employee can

be required to change his handle or Twitter name to
omit reference to the corporate brand. Another ﬁred
CNN reporter, @OctaviaNasrCNN, managed to transi-
tion her followers and tweets to @OctaviaNasr—ie
dropping the CNN.

The scenario raises new legal issues which have yet
to be tested in the courts. Speciﬁc questions include
who owns the Twitter account, can a brand prevent a
person using its brand as part of the person’s Twitter
name, who owns
the tweets, and—perhaps most
importantly—who owns the followers?

Who ‘owns’ the Twitter account?
The Twitter account is a contract made between the
person who sets up the account and Twitter, Inc. of
San Francisco. This contract is governed by the laws of
the State of California.

The procedure to create an account in Twitter is
admirably simple. You provide your full (real) name
and a Twitter user name (or “handle”), you provide
your email address and create a password.

If a person sets up a Twitter account in his or her
own name, that account belongs to him or her in the
sense that the contract with Twitter, Inc. relating to the
account is with that person.

If

the employer can access

If an employee creates an account which is not in his
own name but that of his employer then, subject to any
question about whether the employee had the necessary
authority to make the contract on behalf of the employ-
ee, the account belongs to the employer. However, even
where the account belongs to the employer, the employ-
ee may hold the ‘key’ in that the employee may know
the account password that is necessary to administer the
account.
the (former)
employee’s email address, it may be able to access and
change the password (although that could be hazardous
as the employee could then argue that the employer had
unlawfully accessed the account without authorization).
In some situations, an employer may be able to
argue that, while the employee set up the account in
his or her own name, the employee was acting as agent
for and on behalf of the employer and that, therefore,
the contract with Twitter, Inc. is with the employer.
However, it is only in very speciﬁc circumstances that
this could be the case, for example if the employee has
speciﬁcally agreed with the employer that the Twitter
account would be set up and operated by the employee
but on behalf of and for the beneﬁt of the employer.

As noted above, Twitter has highlighted the parallel
worlds of the personal brand and the corporate brand.
Employers may be pleased to beneﬁt when their

well-known
followings, thereby enhancing at once both the personal
and the corporate brands. It would be incompatible with
that for the employer later to claim that the account was
set up not by or for the individual but by and for the
company (an ‘agency’ or ‘trust’ arrangement).

Further, since tweets tend to blend personal and
business, account holder may use images of themselves,
rather than a corporate logo, or some combination of a
personal
image and corporate logo as background.
Again, where an employer allows an employee to
promote his or her persona it is unlikely that such an
‘agency’ or ‘trust’ argument could succeed.

If

is

Alternatively, an employer may argue that a Twitter
account
simply a platform for content (ie the
employee’s tweets) which is the IP of the employer
because it was created in the course of employment
(discussed below).
the employee then moves to
another company, the employee will no longer have the
right to publish or deal with that content on behalf of
the former employer. It could also be argued that the
account is an enterprise which carries goodwill (the fol-
lowers) which has been generated by the employee for
the beneﬁt of the employer. If this is so, it might be
argued that the account should be held in trust for the
former employer and, if required, transferred to the
former employer or its nominated successor. If the
employee were to claim that goodwill as his or her
own, that claim could be in conﬂict with the employ-
ee’s implied duty of ﬁdelity to the employer.

These arguments are as yet untested in any jurisdic-
tion and, in the absence of any authority on the point,
it would seem to be the case that, where an individual
sets up a Twitter account, unless it is explicit from the
circumstances that this is done on behalf of the corpor-
ate, the account will ‘belong’ to the employee. Nor can
the employer claim to be a third party beneﬁciary
under the contract with Twitter, Inc. as the Twitter
Terms of Service provide that ‘other than members of
the group of companies of which Twitter is the parent,
no other person or company will be third party beneﬁ-
ciaries to the Terms’.

Use of a brand as part of a person’s
Twitter proﬁle?
If you include your employer’s brand as part of your
Twitter handle, and then move to another company,
you can change your name and Twitter handle without
affecting your existing tweets, @replies, direct messages,
or other data. This change can easily be made through
your settings. As the employee has the key to the

account (the password), the employee has the ability to
make this change and there is little that the former
employer can do in order to prevent this. Thus, with a
mouse click, an entire following can be re-directed
from one corporate brand to another, the personal
brand having trumped the corporate brand. This was
what happened with Laura Kuenssberg, whose Twitter
account name was BBCLauraK and was switched to
ITVLauraK.
Twitter’s

that using a
company or business name, logo, or other trade mark-
protected materials in a manner that may mislead or
confuse others with regard to its brand or business
afﬁliation may be considered a ‘trademark policy viola-
tion’. In the event of such a violation, Twitter reserves
the right to ‘suspend the account and reclaim user
names on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold
legal claim or trademark on those user names’. While
this policy may assist a company whose brand is being
misused, or which positively wants a departing employ-
ee to be dissociated with it, it will not provide any
assistance in blocking the migration of an account
from one brand to another.

Who owns the tweets?
Each individual tweet is a nugget of not more than 140
characters. One well-known tweet is probably the very
ﬁrst tweet on 21 March 2006 from Jack Dorsey—the
creator of Twitter—that simply said ‘just setting up my
twttr’.

The ﬁrst question is whether copyright can exist in a
tweet. If there can be copyright, that copyright must be
owned by someone. If the copyright is owned by the
former employer, its claim to ownership of the copy-
right may give the former employer some rights over
the account itself.

Tweets are brief by deﬁnition and such brevity may
deny a tweet copyright protection. However, the test
for copyright protection is not merely quantitative, it is
also qualitative. For copyright to exist in a tweet as a
literary work, it does not matter if the tweet has no art-
istic merit, but it needs to have been created with a
degree of skill, judgement, and individual effort. It is
questionable if slogans can be protected as literary
works and similarly it is the case with tweets. While
many tweets will not qualify for protection as a copy-
right work, some tweets may. A tweet which has sufﬁ-
cient originality in the sense of being the author’s own
intellectual creation could qualify for protection. That

position would be consistent with The Newspaper
Licensing Agency Ltd v Meltwater Holding BV and
others1 in which it was held that newspaper headlines
can have the necessary quality of originality to qualify
as independent literary works and that isolated sen-
tences could be protected if they were the expression of
the intellectual creation of the author. Thus it could be
said that tweets which are little more than low-value
chit-chat or perfunctory comments will not have
copyright protection. However, a tweet that communi-
cates something, is pithy, is the product of some degree
of thought and effort, might well attract copyright
protection.

Where a tweet that attracts copyright protection is
created by an employee in the course of employment,
the employer will be the ﬁrst owner of that copyright,
subject to any agreement to the contrary.2 There is
much case law on the circumstances in which a work
was created ‘in the course of employment’, the answer
to which depends on an analysis of the circumstances
of each case. Sufﬁce it to say for present purposes that,
where an employer has encouraged an employee to
develop a proﬁle in social media, and the subject
matter of the Twitter account is related to the role of
the employee within the business of the employer, one
can see how it could be argued that any copyright-pro-
tected tweets will belong to the employer. The practical
question is whether that outcome serves any useful
purpose to an employer whose employee has success-
fully developed a social media presence but who is now
moving to another company.

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2012, Vol. 7, No. 1

The facts that copyright may exist in a tweet and
that that copyright may be vested in the employer by
operation of law may help support an argument that a
twitter account, created by an employee in the course
of employment, and on which are published tweets
(some of) which are the IP of the employer, perhaps
using technology resources of the employer, and which
bears the employer’s brand,
is to be held by the
employee together with its goodwill (following) for the
beneﬁt of the employer. The difﬁculty is that, while
copyright in a tweet is a recognized form of IP, no IP
exists in the contract for a social media service, or in
the collective of other users of the same service who
choose to view that copyright content.

Who owns the followers?
The value of the Twitter account lies not so much in
the user name, or the collection of tweets, or other
data, but in the loyal following that may have been
established over a protracted period. These followers
represent opportunities for the brand to interact with
its audience.

and applicants

The question of ownership as between employee and
former employer of contacts held on another social
media site, LinkedIn, was considered in Hays Specialist
Recruitment (Holdings) Ltd v Ions.3 Hays made an
application for pre-action disclosure against a former
employee, Mark Ions. Hays argued that Mr Ions had
copied and retained conﬁdential information of Hays,
through the transfer of information concerning Hay’s
clients
to his LinkedIn network.
Mr Ions argued that Hays had encouraged him to use
LinkedIn and that therefore Hays had, in effect, con-
sented to the transfer of contact information. Although
not a decision on the issue, the High Court were
willing to entertain an argument based on a claim for
misuse of conﬁdential information through the transfer
of details onto LinkedIn. However, it is less likely that
an employer could bring a claim on the basis of con-
tacts held only on LinkedIn, and that were not trans-
ferred from the employer’s conﬁdential database.

In PennWell Publishing (UK) Limited v Ornstein,4 the
High Court held that where an employee, who was a
journalist, kept his contact database on his employer’s
computer
the database belonged to the
employer. The judge said:

system,

where an address list is contained on Outlook or some
similar program which is part of the employer’s e-mail

system and backed up by the employer, the database or list
of information . . . will belong to the employer.

The employer was entitled to retain the list of contacts
and got an injunction preventing use of it. The court
held that there was a distinction between executives
who are provided with and/or develop contact infor-
mation for the purpose of doing their job, where
removal of that information would be detrimental to
the employer, and journalists—who need to build up
contacts to use when they need information for articles.
If the employee had kept a separate list of contacts and
selectively copied those which he regarded as long-term
or journalistic contacts (as opposed to those which
would also be useful to the competing business he was
setting up) and maintained them on his own computer,
he would have been able to use them.

transferred from its

While the law may protect a company’s contact data-
base held on its internal systems and which amounts to
its conﬁdential information, and may even protect con-
tacts
internal database to a
LinkedIn account, the nature of Twitter followers is
different. Twitter followers are not derived from the
company’s internal database. You cannot upload, or
even invite, Twitter followers. They are self-selecting,
each follower deciding whether or not to follow, and
whether or not to unfollow. Twitter followers are not
conﬁdential; any one can see a list of followers and the
data they provide about themselves.

One question is whether the collective of followers
of an individual Twitter account amounts to a ‘data-
base right’. If that were to be the case then, as with
copyright, the employer is regarded as the maker of a
database made by an employee in the course of his
employment, subject to any agreement to the contrary.
For a database right to subsist there must have been ‘a
substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or pre-
senting the contents of the database’. In the case of
Twitter, there is certainly an investment in the time
needed to tweet and create a proﬁle which in turn can
generate a substantive following. The problem is that
this investment is in the content, and not in making
the list of followers which is in a sense self-generating.
It is, therefore, unlikely that a ‘database right’ could
subsist in a list of followers.

Ultimately, therefore, it could be said that no one
‘owns’ followers. In reality, it is the followers who decide
whether or not to follow or continue to follow a twitterer
who is migrating from one corporate brand to another.

What can brands do?
Brands
the Twitter
followings of their well-known employees will need to
devise and publish a speciﬁc social media policy
making clear the basis on which employees can set up
and operate Twitter and other social media accounts.

This could include provisions relating to the ownership
of the account and of any copyright in its content, and the
beneﬁt of the followers which it attracts, such that if the
employee moves to another company, the employer would
be entitled to take over the account (and the followers) or
transfer it to another employee and could require the
employee to disclose the password for the account.

employee

This policy could be backed up by a restrictive
covenant preventing the
from tweeting
under, or changing any of the account details of the
Twitter account
following termination of employ-
ment, or actively seeking to migrate users from one
account to another. A restrictive covenant preventing
a former employee using twitter, or using his own
name as part of a twitter handle,
is unlikely to be
enforceable.

The policy will also include terms concerning the
use of
the corporate brand or images within the
account details, as well as more usual terms concerning
content to manage reputational and other legal risks.
