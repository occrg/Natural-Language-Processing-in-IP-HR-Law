Internationalization and Upgrading of 

Copyright Legislation of the Mainland of China 

and Hong Kong 

Xiaoqing FENG* 

On 1 July  1997, China  resumed her  sovereignty over Hong Kong  (HK). Since 
HK’s return,  the co-operation and communication in terms of economy, science and 
technology,  cultural  exchange  and  education  between  the  two  areas  have  been 
expanded, guaranteed, and promoted  by more  effective copyright protection.  As  the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  (Basic Law) is carried out 
and HK’s original laws are basically kept unchanged, HKs copyright legislation will take 
a  new  leaf  in  terms  of  structure,  form  and  content.  However,  HK  as  well  as  the 
Mainland must meet the challenge of the internationalization of copyright protection. 
This article is  intended as a  preliminary study of the internationalization of copyright 
legislation both  in the Mainland and HK and their efforts to revise and improve such 
legislation. 

I. 

INTERNATIONALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION 

In the Mainland of China and Hong Kong, part of the Mainland’s open policy has 
been to legislate and administer copyright law. In 1979, the Mainland began to draft the 
Copyright  Law  and  to  study  how  to  normalize  its  foreign  copyright relationships. 
Because  China  was  coming  a  little  late  to  the  issue  of  copyright  law,  law-makers 
consequently have paid  a  great deal of attention to international practice concerning 
intellectual  property.’  While  drafting  the  Copyright  Law,  law-makers  put  weighty 
consideration upon  the  experiences of other  nations’ copyright  legislation as  well  as 
relevant international conventions and customs. Thus, the Mainland’s Copyright Law 
has tended to correspond with the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literature 
and Art Works (Berne Convention) in terms of major principles and clauses. Therefore, 
&om the  creation  to  the  implementation  of  its  Copyright  Law,  the  Mainland  has 
proceeded  along  the  way  of  internationalization. It  is  perhaps  fair  to  say  that  the 
Copyright Law approaches “basically up to the standards of the Berne Convention, and 
is a modernized and internationalized copyright law with Chinese characteristics.”z

To  revise  and  begin  implementation,  the  Copyright  Law  is  just  the  first  step 
towards  internationalization,  for  China  has  not  yet  signed  those  basic  international 
copyright  conventions.  World-wide,  in  spite  of  different  political  and  economic 
regimes, more  nations  than  ever  seem  to be integrating  and  co-ordinating  copyright 
protection,  both  in  forms  of  principle  and  policy.  This  reflects  the  international 
tendency towards uniformity in the protection of copyrights. The tendency in fact dates 
from  1886 when  the  Berne  Convention  was  origmally  contracted.  Along  with  the 
integration  of  international  communication  and  co-operation, 
the  international 
protection of copyrights continues to develop. For example, the signing of the Universal 
Copyright  Convention  (1 952),  the  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Performers, 
Record Producers  and Broadcast Organizations  (1 961)  (the Rome Convention),  and 
the  Convention  on  the  Protection  of  Record  Producers  and  Prevention  of 
Reproduction  (1971)  (the  Records  Convention)  mark  the  coming  of  new  eras  in 
world-wide  copyright protection.  The tendency  towards  uniformity  has  been  greatly 
promoted by the developing international and cross-cultural communication as well as 
by the implementation  of the conventions. 

With  the  circumstances  of  strengthening 

internationalization  of  copyright 
protection,  the  Mainland  has  moved  to join  the  Berm  Convention,  the  Universal 
Copyright Convention and the Records Convention. In 1992, the State Council issued 
Provisions  on  the  Implementation  of International  Copyright  Treaties.  In  1994, the 
Standing  Committee of the  National  Peoples  Congress  (NPc) made  the  decision  to 
punish  crimes against copyright infringements.  Later, the  Customs Protection Act for 
Intellectual  Property  was  promulgated,  followed  by 
the  establishment  of  the 
Kegistration  System for  Audio  and  Video  Recording  Contracts  Regarding  Foreign 
Affairs, the Permission and Attestation System of Copyrights Regardmg Foreign Affairs, 
the System of LD Identification Markings, and the System for Adrmnistrative Sanctions 
Regarding Copyrights.  Furthermore,  the  Sino-U.S.  Memorandum of Understanchng 
on the Protection of Intellectual Property was concluded by the Chinese and American 
governments in 1992. Therefore, the Mainland has made every effort over the past few 
years to establish a copyright protection system with a high level of internationalization, 
leaving less and less variance between  China and advanced countries in terms of degree 
of protection.  The speed with which  China has been able to accomplish this has been 
remarkable in the course of developing international  relationships. 

Generally speaking, the internationalization of the Mainland's copyright legislation 

is to be attained through the following measures: 

(a) 

Establishing relevant international institutions under the current Copyright 
Law. Though originally a domestic law,  the Copyright  Law bears foreign 
characteristics and regulates foreign copyright  relations. While drafting the 
Copyright  Law, the  Mainland  noticed  that  some  internationally  accepted 
fundamental principles had come into being. For example, Article 2 of the 

COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION OF THE MAINLAND OF  CHINA AND HONG  KONG 

585 

international  commitments 

Law  recognizes  the  “territorial  principle”  and  “reciprocal principle”  of 
prevailing international copyrights. 
Formulating a legal system of copyright protection pursuant to international 
standards, so as to make the Chinese copyright system internationalized. The 
Mainland’s copyright legslative history is marked by a late start and a poor 
basis  &om  which  to  start.  Facing  international  tendencies  towards 
uniformity,  China  is  trying  to  rapidly  reach  high  levels  and  attain  high 
standards. Consequently, it is formulating a copyright legal system according 
to international standards. This should be fundamentally sound, making the 
Mainland’s copyright systems adaptable to prevaihng international standards 
and practice and thereby preparing the way for the Mainland’s entry into 
international copyright treaties and trade organizations. 
Actively  concluding  international  conventions  concerning  copyright 
protection  and  undertaking 
to  protect 
copyrights.  Once  in  effect  in  the  Mainland,  the  international copyright 
conventions automatically become part of Chinese domestic laws except for 
reserved clauses  by  declaration. Having concluded these conventions, the 
Mainland  is  connected  tightly  with  the  international  community  in 
copyright protection. 
Positively  contracting  bilateral  agreements  with  other  nations  to  settle 
particular problems of copyright protection.  In  1992 and  1995 China and 
the United States negotiated agreements on intellectual property, which set 
a good example for promoting co-ordmation and co-operation in copyright 
protection through bilateral negotiations between nations. 
Amending the existing copyright laws  and malung them  modernized and 
internationalized. Some of the Mainland’s copyright laws are still products 
of  the  planned  economy  and  are  not  consistent  with  requirements  for 
developing  the  market  economy.  Furthermore,  there  is  still  a  big  gap 
between  the  Mainland’s copyright legislation  and  international standards, 
which makes  it necessary  to revise and upgrade the law. More discussions 
hereto will be given later. 

In  short,  the  internationalization  of  the  Mainland’s  copyright  legislation  will 

develop in light of the following principles: 

- 

- 

- 

the internationalization of copyright legislation is to be modified up to the 
standard  of  international  conventions  on  copyright  protection  and  to 
establish  basic  principles  of  copyright  protection  in  the  Mainland’s 
Copyright Law and international conventions; 
the  internationalization  of  copyright  legislation  will  be  based  on  the 
independent copyright protection principles in Chinese domestic laws; and 
the internationalization of copyright legislation will be a process of gradually 

586 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

upgrading  domestic  laws  on  copyright  while  observing  the  minimum 
protection  levels in international conventions. 

HK’s former copyright decrees were established under  the British Copyright Act 
(1956), which has been revised many times by the British Privy Council and then been 
extended to HK. The HK legislature has also drawn up the Copyright Act in respect of 
actual  needs.  The  contents  of  the  Act  have  in  fact  been  subsidiary,  as  were  other 
accessory rules, such as the Copyright  (Notice of Publication) Rules and the Royalties 
(Record Version) System’s Rules, which were all contributions to the implementation 
of the British Copyright Act. In short, before return, HK protected copyrights by direct 
implementation  of British  copyright  laws.  As  at  present,  the  British  Copyright  Act 
which was extended to HK has  become the foundation  for HK’s  copyright  practices. 
The Act has played a dominant role in the continuing economic vitality of HK. 

When HK’s return to China was approaching, HK’s copyright laws were in urgent 
need  of  updating  or  revision  in  terms  of  localized  form,  modernization  and 
internationalization  in content. Without running counter to the Basic Law of HK and 
relevant  international  copyright  conventions,  they  needed  to  keep  up  with  the 
international  standards  while  bearing  HK’s  characteristics,  particularly  taking  into 
account  all interest  groups.  Furthermore,  as  HK is  one of the  world’s largest tradmg 
centres,  its  copyright  protection  system  demands  a  highly  developed  international 
system as it pertains to intellectual property  protection.  Given the context, on 24 June 
1997, HK’s legislature passed the new Copyright Act which came into effect on 27 June 
1997. 

The new  Copyright Act adds significant amendments  to the old one. It is  drawn 
up  under  Article  139 of the  Basic  Law,  the  Universal  Copyright  Convention,  the 
Records  Convention,  and  related  provisions  in  the  Agreement  on  Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property  (TRIPS). One significant feature of the new Copyright 
Act is its effort  to reach and sustain international standards, especially TRIPS standards. 
For example,  the act  explicitly provides  that  works  are protected  automatically.3 The 
copyright protection period, if the author is definitely known, should extend fifty years 
from the date of the work’s completion, plus the author’s lifetime. As  to  anonymous 
works, works produced  for the computer or as films, records, prograinmes of radio and 
cablc communication, the period should be from the year of the issuing or publishing 
date and be void after fifty years. 

In accordance with provisions of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic 
Law,  HK’s  original  laws  and  regulations  (including  common  laws,  equity  laws, 
enactments, accessory legislation, and customary  laws) were retained,  except for those 
which are contradictory to the Basic Law after HK’s  return to China. However, British 
statutory  law  lost  its  official  status  as  the  foundation  for  application  of  copyright 
protection  in HK. Undoubtedly,  the simultaneous localization and internationalization 

3  Another important  feature of it is  to adopt a set of copyright protection systems opening to the world; i.e. 
copyrighted works  created by  any natural person  or legal  person  and  published anywhere in  the world  can be 
protected by copyright in HK. 

COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION OF THE MAINLAND OF CHINA AND HONG KONG 

587 

of HK’s Copyright Act intends to make HK copyright laws an important component of 
HK’s separate system of intellectual property protection.4 

When  studying  the  internationalization  of  HKs  copyright  legislation,  the 
discussion  should  include  how  relevant  international  conventions  on  copyright 
protection  were being implemented in  HK before its return.  Theoretically, HK  can 
only  join  a  few  international  treaties  with  open  regimes  and  cannot  join  those 
international treaties that are solely open to sovereign states. As  a matter of fact, before 
HK’s return, the international treaties in force in HK have applied indirectly through 
the territorial application clauses  of the treaties signed by Britain or because of British 
declarations. In terms of copyright law, the treaties thus applied to HK mainly were: the 
Berne  Convention,  the  Universal Copyright  Convention,  the Records  Convention, 
the Rome Convention, and the Brussels Convention on the Transmission of Program 
Signals By Satellites (the Satellites Convention) .5 

The  issue,  then,  is  to  sort  out  the  hture  course  for  HK  considering those 
international copyright conventions that the Mainland of China has  or has not signed 
versus  those applied in HK by Britain, so that HK copyright law can be reaffirmed or 
modfied accordmgly. As for the international agreements that the Peoples Republic of 
China  (PRc) has  concluded, Article  153 of the Basic  Law  prescribes that the  central 
People’s Government, after considering the real situation and needs of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and consulting the HKSAR’S own proposals, will 
make  a  proper  determination of how  copyright protection  should be  applied in  the 
HKSAR. As  for  those conventions that  the  PRC has  not  adopted but  HK has  already 
implemented, the  determination has  been made to  continue their implementation in 
HK.6 Therefore, the PRC decided the best course for HK is one of continuity of those 
copyright relations already established between HK and other nations and regions. 

Overall  there  exists  a  common  cause  for  both  the  Mainland’s  and  HK’s 
internationalization of copyright legislation. Considering external factors, the problem 
of intellectual property  rights  has  been  recently  given  much  more  attention  by  the 
international community;  as  a  result,  the  level  of  intellectual property  protection  is 
increasing  globally.  The 
rapid 
internationalization. Considering internal factors, both  the Mainland and HK greatly 
need a strengthening of their communication and co-operation with  the world-wide 
community  in  terms  of  economics,  culture,  science  and  technology.  Only  the 
internationalization of  copyright legislation  can  meet  these  strenuous requirements. 
Therefore, the Mainland’s and HKs internationalization of copyright legislation is not 

intensive  attention  has  promoted  more 

4  Independence here means that the Copyright Act of HK after the return is one separated from British laws 
and from laws applied on the Mainland. That is to say, in respect of copyright protection, HK and the Mainland 
are two independent legal domains; copyright legislation in effect in HK cannot be automatically protected by the 
Copyright Law of the Mainland, and vice verso. 

5  The latter two international conventions have not been joined by the Mainland. 
6  It can be understood that, combining with Article 151 of the Basic Law, international treaties applied to HK 
after its return include: most of the international treaties originally applied to HK, international treaties joined by 
and applied to HK, and those signed or joined by the HKSAR in the name of “HK, China”. The same pattern

mere acquiescence to international custom, but conscious acknowledgement that this is 
the best course for both the PRC and HK. 

11.  THE UPGRADING  OF COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION 

As  aforesaid, the Mainland’s and HKs copyright legislation are evolving steadily 
towards  internationalization.  However,  given  the  requirements  of  international 
copyright conventions, both of them have a long way to go before reaching successful 
implementation.  The  Mainland’s  and  HK’s  copyright  legislation  wdl  need  hrther 
upgrades to be fully integrated in accordance with international standards. 

Compared  to  HK,  the  Mainland’s  copyright legislation has  more  problems  in 
adopting the course of internationahation because of various factors. First, although the 
planned integration with international standards gained much attention at the time of 
the  drafting of  the  Copyright  Law,  the  law-makers  did  not  actually  expect  to  sign 
international copyright conventions, especially the Beme Convention, until a few years 
after the promulgation of the Copyright Law. Thus, some draft clauses take into account 
much  more  the  “national  conditions”  than  the  international  requirements.  Not 
surprisingly, since becoming a signatory of international copyright conventions sooner 
rather  than later, a  number  of contradictions between  Chinese and international law 
keep cropping up.’ 

Second,  the  Mainland’s  Copyright  Law,  promulgated  in  September  1990  and 
which came into effect on 1 June 1991, cannot co-ordmate easily or fully with market 
economic systems because of peculiar elements of its partially planned economy. Third, 
after the promulgation of the Copyright Law, there evolved further developments in the 
international copyright  system  as  copyright protection  was  being  intensified world- 
wide. Special attention should be paid to the TRIPS, made in the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade  (GATT), which  is  a high-level  international 
agreement issuing hgher standards to protect  intellectual property and represents the 
new  hlgher  criterion for intellectual property protection  now  applicable in  the most 
advanced countries. China will eventually join the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
so  it  is  natural  to plan  for  co-ordination  with  the  TRIPS, even  though  the  present 
Copyright Law has some shortcomings in regard to it. 

Fourth, the  Mainland is  not yet integrated with  the international community in 
terms  of  copyright legislation. In  1992, the  State  Council  issued  Provisions on the 
Implementation of International Treaties for Copyright, which has attempted to settle 
the  problem  of protecting  foreigners’ copyrights within  Chinese territory; however, 
Chinese do not as yet enjoy the same rights and interests conferred on foreigners by the 
new Provisions. This leads to an anomaly where copyright protection for foreigners is 
higher inside China than that for Chinese, which is  a rarefied inversion of the world 
practice copyright history. If this phenomenon were to continue indefinitely, it might

and Foreign Countries’ Legal Science (1997). 

COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION  OF THE MAINLAND  OF CHINA AND  HONG KONG

institutionalize a large-scale  &scrimination against  national works. “In the near future, 
it will suppress the initiative of our authors and hasten the brain drain, which is, in fact, 
not  useful  to international co-ordination  for our copyright protection.”* Confionted 
with  considerable variance from international standards, the need for the Mainland to 
amend the old Copyright Law has come to the fore of its legislative agenda.9 Amending 
the law presents a few important problems which need to be stumed fiom the viewpoint 
of internationalization of copyright legislation and with  reference to  HK’s  copyright 
legislation. 

As  for  the  protection  of computer programs, Article  10 of the  TRIPS explicitly 
provides  that  computer  programs  expressed  by  source  code  or  objective  code  are 
protected  as  literary  works  that  are  referred  to  in  the  1971 version  of  the  Berne 
Convention.  The  provisions  reflect  the  latest  international  tendency  to  protect 
computer programs. The protection of computer programs by the Mainland copyright 
laws  is  marked  by  determining  such  programs  as  object  to  copyright  law.  This  is 
expressed in some detail in the Regulation on Protection of Computer Software issued 
by  the  State  Council,  which  shows a  substantial  difference to  copyright  of literary 
workslo and is at odds with international copyright law in many respects. In the course 
of  amending  the  Mainland’s  copyright  laws,  this  Regulation  should  probably  be 
abolished, so that the Mainland is in accord with  the TRIPS. Already HK’s Copyright 
Act  accepts that  computer programs  should be  introduced  into  the  scope of literary 
works. 

As  regards rental rights for copyrighted works, TRIPS provides that any Member of 
GATT should confer  to  authors  of  computer programs  and films,  as  well  as  to their 
legitimate heirs, the right to allow or ban the rental of an original copyrighted work or 
its  copies. The Mainland’s Copyright Law  does not  affirm rental rights, but  they are 
somewhat acknowledged through  the  interpretation of  “issue” in  the  Regulation  on 
Implementation of the Copyright Law.”  However, such an inexplicit prescription has 
defects.  For  one,  since  it  is  stated  only  in  the  form  of  subordinate  administrative 
enactment, protection of rental rights may be vague and weak. At the same time, it seems 
only to be intended to refer to the rental of a replica, not  the original, whereas HKs 
Copyright Act confirms the rights for records (with the exception of films) and computer 
programs, bestowing upon copyright owners the right to ban any rental of their records 
and computer programs for profits without their prior consent. It would be worthwhile 
for the provision on rental rights in the Mainland’s copyright legislation to also confirm 
those rights for general works while observing relevant provisions of the TRIPS. 

*  See Xiaoqing Feng, The Modern Intellectual Property Law, Hunan Press, 1997, at 442. 
It is natural that several reaSons help to bring about the amendment of the Copyright Law of the Mainland, 
such as to meet the need of a developing market economic system; to strengthen market regulations of copyright; 
to meet the need of the new technology revolution; to improve the modernization of copyright legislation; and to 
co-ordinate the conflicts and contradictions of the Copyright Law, Regulations and Ordinances at present, in order 
to set up an integrated and thorough copyright system.

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

In  respect  to  copyright limitation,  the  Berm  Convention  and  the  TRIPS have 

several provisions. These provisions possess the following features. 

First, allowing for the limitation of copyright to be confined to certain exceptions 
that cannot breach the reasonable use ofworks and cannot unreasonably harm copyright 
owners’ lawfbl interests. 

Second, the issue of copyright limitation emphasizes the reasonable use of works. 
Comparatively, the Mainland’s Copyright Law  has  a broader scope of copyright 
limitation; some  of  its  provisions  still  are  quite  different  from  those  of  the  Berne 
Convention.  For  example, as  to  the  conduct  of re-broadcast  or republishing others’ 
works, Article 22(4) of the Mainland’s Copyright Law  is  likely to let the scope of re- 
broadcast and republished works  go beyond that  of political, economic and religious 
matters permitted by  Article  lO(1) of the Berne Convention. Especially, Article 43 of 
the Mainland’s Copyright Law establishes the principle of “lawful free use”, i.e. if radio 
stations and  TV  stations broadcast  the  already published  works  without  intention  to 
make profits, they need not  gain prior consent from authors, performers and record- 
makers  and  need  not  pay  for  such  use.  This  provision  is  so  far  removed  from  the 
minimum requirements of the international convention that undoubtedly it should be 
deleted in the new law. 

As  regards the  legal  sanctions against  the  infringement of copyright, under  the 
TRIPS, legal  responsibilities  for  infringement  of  copyright  consist  of  civil  remedies, 
administrative remedies, penal remedies, as well as stopgap and border measures, such 
as customs seizure of illegal replications for export or import. HK’s Copyright Act does 
include civil remedies, customs and border measures, paralleling the import and penal 
sanctions generally integrated with  the TRIPS. The Mainland’s Copyright Law and its 
Regulation  on  the  Implementation  have  special provisions  for  penal  sanctions and 
border measures, which have allowed upgrades in the form of the following rules: the 
Decision to Punish Crimes Against Copyright by the Standing Committee of NPC, the 
Criminal  Law  of  1997,  and  the  Customs  Protection  Regulation  for  Intellectual 
Property. These will undoubtedly be included with other amendments to the Copyright 
Law. 

111.  THE CO-ORDINATION OF COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION BETWEEN  THE MAINLAND 

AND HONG KONG 

From the aforesaid, it can be seen that internationalization of the Mainland’s  and 
HK’s copyright legislation is the main feature and principle guiding the development of 
their respective copyright regimes. With the Mainland intensiGing reforms and trying 
to  strengthen  HK’s  position  as  a  major  international  trade  centre,  the  copyright 
legislation of both the PRC and HK must be further internationalized. 

If  the  Mainland  and  HK  both  upgrade  and  internationalize  their  copyright 
legislation, smoother  co-operation  between  them  will  probably  be  realized. Before 

COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION O F  THE MAINLAND OF CHINA A N D  HONG KONG 

591 

HK’s return to China, some Western scholars felt certain that the Mainland’s Copyright 
Law would be extended to HK to substitute for the British legal system. Yet in the list 
of nation-wide  laws and regulations  to be applied  in HK  that  is  supplemental to the 
Basic Law, the Copyright Law was not included. As mentioned before, HK’s copyright 
laws have not only been  separated from British laws but also from the established laws 
in the Mainland. The localization and internationalization  of HK’s copyright law will 
help  establish its substantial role  in international  trade.  However,  on the other hand, 
the Mainland’s and HK’s copyright legislation will need to be upgraded and modified 
as  they  seek  to  achieve  integration  with  the  evolving  internationalized  copyright 
system. In the process, the two systems should move closer together  in actual practice, 
which,  in  turn, provides  the  objective  basis  €or more co-operation  and integration. 
Indeed,  it  is  both  feasible  and  necessary  for  the  Mainland’s  and  HK’s  copyright 
legislation to co-operate  and integrate with one another. 

First, the  HKSAR is  now an indispensable part  of the  PRC. Although  the HKSAR 
enjoys high-degree  autonomy, it is still an administrative region inside the PRC. While 
those copyright laws should be preserved, it should be quite possible for HK to adapt to 
the Mainland’s copyright legislation in legal terms, legislative technolops,  substantive 
laws and procedures. This will benefit both the Mainland’s and HK’s copyright regime 
through  communication  and  help  develop  a  comprehensive,  integrated  copyright 
regime. 

Second, since HK’s return,  China has taken  the place of Britain  as  the sovereign 
nation representing HK among the Member nations of relevant copyright conventions. 
As changes occur in the legal foundation for HK’s application to international copyright 
treaties, it may find itself increasingly tied to the Mainland in the international copyright 
protection system. 

Third, as mentioned above, HK’s copyright works will not gain natural copyright 
status outside HK (excluding Britain and those regions to which British Copyright Law 
applies), and  vice  versa.  Since the Mainland  and  HK  are both  Members  of  the Berne 
Convention and the Universal  Copyright Convention, HK’s copyright works w d  be 
protected  in  Member  nations  of  the  conventions  and  vice  versa.  Therefore,  the 
Mainland’s and HK’s  copyright works  can, of course,  gain protection  in  each  other’s 
jurisdiction.  The  co-ordination  of  the  Mainland’s  and  HK’s  copyright  legislation 
undoubtedly  will help  to mitigate  any conflicting  regional  issues  in the application  of 
copyright laws. At the same time, the revision and upgrading of their copyright laws will 
serve to advance both their relationship with each other and their international relations 
and aspirations.
