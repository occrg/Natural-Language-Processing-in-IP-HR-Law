Intangible heritage: traditional medicine
and knowledge governance1
Valentina Vadi*

Although traditional medicine (TM) constitutes a
component part of the identity of the cultural commu-
nities concerned, this form of intangible cultural heri-
tage is vulnerable in a globalizing world where little
place is left for alternative knowledge and the protec-
tion of belief systems. As to traditional medical knowl-
edge, the policies of major pharmaceutical companies
pose additional threats.

Besides the issue of biogenetic resources, which has
been broadly analysed by the literature, this contri-
bution addresses the complex interplay between TM,
intended as a special form of intangible cultural heri-
tage, and international knowledge governance.

Proprietary approaches to the protection of TM
will be shown to be inadequate to ensure proper
protection of
form of knowledge.
Different approaches will be put forward and a Treaty
on Medical Research and Development will be con-
sidered.

traditional knowledge (TK)
No single deﬁnition of
fully does justice to the diverse forms of knowledge
that are held by traditional communities. What makes
knowledge traditional is not its antiquity but its tra-
ditional link with a certain community. Indeed, TK is a
vital, dynamic component part of the lives of many
contemporary communities. For many communities,
TK forms part of a holistic worldview; it is inseparable
from ways of life, from cultural values, and spiritual
beliefs. However, TK also has a strong practical com-
ponent, since it is often developed in part as an intel-
lectual response to the necessities of life. This means
that
it can have a dramatic beneﬁcial effect upon
society more broadly, particularly in the case of TM.

Key issues
† Tensions continue to erupt between the Inter-
national IP regulation and the exploitation of
traditional knowledge (TK), particularly with
regard to medicinal products.

† Despite these tensions, it is apparent both that
TK and modern concepts in IP protection may
have much to offer one another.

† This article considers the scope for a legal regime
that is sensitive to cultural and economic rights
of the TK custodians.

Although these practices are highly pragmatic, indi-

knowledge as emanating from a spiritual base. TM is
based on world views that take into account mental,
social, spiritual, physical, and ecological dimensions of
health and well-being. The core of TM precisely con-

its gloss consists of empirical applications.

Traditional medicinal knowledge plays an important
role in treating illnesses in developing countries, where
it helps meet some of the primary health care needs.3
TM can also have a fundamental role in industrialized

population of most non-industrial countries relies on traditional forms of
medicine for primary health care. In Africa, up to 80 per cent of the
population uses traditional medicine for primary health care. WHO,

development of new drugs.4 Further, as the developed
world increasingly demands herbal medicine, this is a
further indication of the great value of TM.

Traditional knowledge as intangible
cultural heritage
According to the Convention for the Safeguarding of
Intangible Cultural Heritage,5 TK is a form of intan-
gible cultural heritage as it is part of the

practices, knowledge, skills—as well as the instruments,

communities,
groups . . . and individuals recognize as part of their cul-
tural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted
from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by
communities and groups in response to their . . . inter-
action with nature . . . and provides them with a sense of
identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cul-
tural diversity and human creativity.6

The intangible cultural heritage is manifested,
inter
alia, in the domains of knowledge and practices con-
cerning the nature and universe.7 These include knowl-
edge, know how, skills, practices, and representations
which may form entire cognitive systems often dis-
played in a broad complex of values and beliefs and
thus
linked to speciﬁc world views. This domain
encompasses numerous

copoeia and shamanism.8

The apparent distinction between arts and culture
on the one hand and science on the other is a split
largely due to Western thinking. TM is
seen as
common heritage by indigenous people.9 For instance,
a masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of
humanity is the Andean cosmology of the Kallawaya
(Bolivia) whose principal activity involves the practice
of ancestral medicine. The term Kallawaya means
‘herbalists from the sacred land of medicine’. The
priest doctors have developed a traditional medical

support to the government for the production of anti-malarial drugs
derived from the Chinese herbal remedy Artemisia annua, effective
against resistant malaria. Local production of the medicine will bring the
price of one dose down from US$6 to a more affordable $2 and could
help prevent almost one million deaths annually.

Cultural Heritage is expressly meant to safeguard intan-

cooperation and assistance.10 In this context,
‘safe-

viability of the intangible cultural heritage, including
promotion, enhancement,

through education, as well as the revitalization of the
various aspects of such heritage.11

IP rights or to the use of biological and ecological
resources to which they are parties.

These goals are compatible with the goals expressed
with regard to TK by the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD),13 which expressly mentions sustain-
able use of biological resources. The point is whether
the international IP regime is coherent with the Con-
vention’s goals.

The immaterial aspect of medical
knowledge
Knowledge must be kept distinct
from biogenetic
resources: while the latter are exhaustible, knowledge
has some characteristics of public goods.14 Knowledge
is not exhausted by use:
it can be used repeatedly
without any individual consumer depriving another of
its use. Further, wide dissemination of knowledge can
promote
creation of ameliorative knowledge.
Instead of fearing the tragedy of commons, the inter-
national community should fear the tragedy of anti-
commons in underutilization of knowledge and in
particular scientiﬁc knowledge.

expense of others,

A classic problem with a commons is that, as a
shared resource which all may access freely, it creates
strong incentives for individuals to maximize their use
at
the
commons’.15 But can the issue of exhaustibility be
transposed from the physical world to the world of
ideas? Unlike most other kinds of commons, knowledge
is not threatened by over-use and is improved through
free access, through the sharing and consumption of
information.16

Remembering TK’s two fundamental components
can be useful in the research for methods of safeguard-
ing, protecting, and diffusing it, in the full respect of
indigenous heritage.

13 Art 8(j) of the CBD on In Situ Conservation of genetic resources (and

not on TK as such) requires States to ‘respect, preserve and maintain
knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local
communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the
conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote
wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of
such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable
sharing of the beneﬁts arising from the utilization of such knowledge,
innovations and practices’. This contemplates three rights; right to
respect, prior informed consent, and right to the equitable sharing arising
from the exploitation.

Property Rights and Economic Development’, in KE Maskus (ed), The

Proprietary approaches

to knowledge governance
have become stronger than ever since the inception of
the Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property
Rights Agreement18 (TRIPs) under the World Trade
Organization (WTO). TRIPs is the most comprehen-
sive international treaty that sets global standards for
IP and is binding upon all WTO members.19

Although TRIPs sets minimum standards, according
to many observers most of its terms are based on the
prevailing standards in developed countries. Further,
the Agreement also subjects disputes between WTO
members with respect to their TRIPs obligations to the
WTO dispute settlement procedures.

TRIPs attempts

to balance the long-term social
objective of providing incentives for future inventions
with the short-term objective of allowing people to use
existing inventions and creations. Article 7 states:

The protection and enforcement of intellectual property
rights should contribute to the promotion of
techno-
logical innovation and to the dissemination of technol-
ogy, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of
technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to
social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights
and obligations.20

This balance between public and private interests has
already been discussed in the context of pharmaceutical

17 Art 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights proclaims the right of everyone ‘to enjoy the beneﬁts of scientiﬁc

artistic production of which he is the author’.

patents21 where an intense debate led to the amendment
of the Agreement.22

While TRIPs requires pharmaceutical patents protec-
tion, it makes no reference to the protection of TK. At
issue is whether TM constitutes patentable subject
matter. It is difﬁcult for TM to comply with patent
standards. First, as TM usually exists within a certain
group or community, it is impossible to attribute it to
any individual.23 Second, as it has been passed from
generation to generation, it is not new in terms of the
novelty criteria of the IP laws.

A patent application should always be rejected if
there is prior public knowledge about the product.
However, in many developed nations, prior art is only
recognized if it is published in a journal or is available
in a database, not if it has been passed down through
oral and folk traditions.24 Thus, there have been cases
in which TM has been patented by an applicant who
has no entitlement to do so.

Four illustrations of the tension
between patents and TK
In 1995, the US Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce granted a
patent on the wound-healing properties of turmeric.
The claimed invention was considered novel at the
time of application on the basis of the information
then available to the examining authority. The patent
was subsequently challenged and found invalid, as
further documentation was made available (including
ancient Sanskrit scripts) that demonstrated that the
Indians knew of
turmeric. The
patent was ﬁnally revoked.

these properties of

In 2005, the European Patent Ofﬁce (EPO) revoked
a patent granted on an anti-fungal product derived
from neem. The Indian government obtained the revo-
cation of the patent, successfully arguing that the medi-
cinal neem tree is part of traditional Indian medicine.

Traditionally, neem derivatives have been used to make
insect repellents, soaps, cosmetics, and tooth cleaners.
In particular, the subject matter of the claim was held
to lack inventive step since it was obvious to try to use
formulations such as those deﬁned in the claim for
controlling fungi on plants.

A more recent case concerned a patent application
for a pharmaceutical composition having appetite sup-
pressant activity at the EPO. The composition, aimed
at preventing, treating and combating obesity, con-
tained as an active ingredient an extract from a plant of
the genus Hoodia. This genus has been known for a
long time as a traditional foodstuff of original inhabi-
tants of the Kalahari Desert, because eating the plant
efﬁciently removes the pangs of hunger for days. In
accordance with the problem– solution approach, the
Boards of Appeal have repeatedly pointed out that,
when assessing inventive step, prior art should relate to
the subject matter conceived for the same purpose or
aiming at the same objective as the claimed inven-
tion.25 In 2005 a Board of Appeal, reversing the Exam-
ining Division’s decision, held that ‘a skilled person,
knowing that consumption of Hoodia removed the
pangs of hunger, could not obviously derive from this
disclosure that an extract from the plant could be used
for the manufacture of an appetite suppressant, anti-
obesity medicament’.26

In the legal challenge to a patent over ayahuasca, a
rainforest plant with psychotropic effects, US patent
examiners refused to accept the oral evidence of an
Amazon Shaman about his people TK of the plant’s
healing properties. In his patent application, Miller, a
Californian entrepreneur, stated that ‘Da Vine’ was a
new distinct plant. However, Amazonian shamans have
known and used varieties of ayahuasca as a source of
supernatural power
in cultural and spiritual cere-
monies. Thus, they were profoundly disturbed that
anyone could get private property on this plant and
undermine their cultural values.27

21 See eg A Attaran ‘How Do Patents and Economic Policies Affect Access

to Essential Medicines in Developing Countries?’ 23 Health Affairs 3
(2004) 155– 166.

22 WTO General Council Decision of 6 December 2005 WT/L/641, http://

www.wto.org/English/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e/wtl641_e.htm

23 The dissemination of knowledge within a group may vary, eg Shamans

often have knowledge about medical properties of plants that are not
known by the other members of the community. These differences in the
dissemination of knowledge do not change the character of the
knowledge as being collective though. See A Meyer, ‘International
Environmental Law and Human Rights: Towards the Explicit Recognition
of Traditional Knowledge’ (2001) 10 RECIEL 1, 38.

24 For instance, under title 35 United States Code Section 102, which

deﬁnes prior art, a person is not entitled to a patent if the invention was
‘known or used by others in this country, or was patented or described in

a printed publication in this or a foreign country’ before the date of
invention by the applicant for the patent. As Tarasofsky puts it, ‘in some
jurisdictions, such as the United States, oral evidence of prior art—which
is all that may exist of some traditional knowledge—is not admissible in
the patent process’. See R Tarasofsky, ‘Report on Trade, Environment and
Intellectual Property Rights’ Chatham House, London, 2005, p. 5, http://

Traditional knowledge and the right
to privacy
Another aspect to be considered is the fact that making
TM available to the public may violate customary laws
and practices of indigenous people. Some communities
regard TK as powerful and dangerous and believe it
should be transmitted only under particular circum-
stances or to particular kinds of people. Sometimes, TK
is regarded as a gift, whose acceptance obligates the
receiver to carry out the activity to which the obli-
gation pertains.28 Particularly because TK is often kept
secret, it is not uncommon for it to be discovered only
when something threatens it.

In common law jurisdictions, publication of sacred-
secret materials has been successfully prevented, using
breach of conﬁdence action. For instance, in Foster v
Mountford,29 members of
the Pijanjara Council
obtained an interlocutory injunction, on the basis of
breach of conﬁdence, to restrain the publication of a
book entitled Nomads of the Australian Desert.

The plaintiffs successfully argued that the book con-
tained information that could only have been exposed
in conﬁdence to the anthropologist Dr Mountford,
35 years earlier, highlighting that the revelation of that
information to their women, children, and uninitiated
men might undermine the social stability of their com-
munity. The court found that the information was of
deep religious and cultural signiﬁcance to the tribe and
that its publication amounted to a breach of conﬁ-
dence. An injunction was granted to prevent the sale of
the book as post-publication damages were not con-
sidered to be an appropriate remedy.

One may argue that, because of the special
linkage to their TK and folklore, indigenous
people own moral rights with regard
to the expression of their cultural identity

One may argue that, because of the special linkage to
their TK and folklore, indigenous people own moral

rights with regard to the expression of their cultural
identity. Moral rights usually consist of the right of
authors to be identiﬁed as such (the right to paternity)
and to object to having their works altered in ways that
would prejudice their honour and reputation (the right
to integrity). These include the right
to determine
whether to publish and disclose a certain contribution.
The right to privacy might play a role in this regard,
this being the right of an individual or a community to
keep their lives and personal affairs out of public view
or to control the ﬂow of information about themselves.
Because TK is part of the cultural identity of indigen-
ous people, an extensive interpretation of the right to
privacy might be adopted against possible intrusion or
theft to protect the enjoyment of the individual and
collective private sphere including personal cosmologi-
cal beliefs.

Proprietary approaches
Should traditional medical knowledge be recognized as
the property of communities where that knowledge ori-
ginated?30 Have indigenous people an inalienable or
property right to deny access, and not merely a liability
or remuneration right to seek compensation for access?
Theoretically, two approaches are possible: a proprie-
tary approach and a mixed approach, based on the
concept of custodianship.

Adopting a proprietary approach, how may one
ensure that the IP system functions better to serve the
interests of traditional communities? This is one of the
major issues to be addressed in the recently launched
Doha round of WTO negotiations.31

In order to prevent unauthorized use of TK by third
sharing among TK
parties and to ensure beneﬁt
holders,
forward,
focusing on reform or amendment of TRIPs, based on
negative or defensive protection of TM.32

several proposals have been put

Patentability requires novelty,

inventiveness, and
practical applicability. As a general rule, patent appli-
cants must disclose to the patent authority all infor-
mation known to be material to the patentability.33

disclosure of origin of biological resources and TK.
According to this proposal, patent applications based
on use of TK should include a description of the TK
utilized in the invention and evidence of compliance
with national laws (ie on access to and use of genetic
resources
and international principles
regarding prior informed consent of the indigenous
community and beneﬁt-sharing under the CBD.35 The
EU’s proposal36 would limit the focus to disclosure of
origin of genetic material directly used in the invention
and would not extend to TK as such.

and TK)34

Some proposals support the creation of an inter-
national certiﬁcation system. Competent authorities
would give written assurance that a product or process
is in conformity with relevant international law requir-
ing beneﬁt sharing and prior informed consent. Such a
certiﬁcate of origin would be a necessary element of
patent applications. While national and regional certiﬁ-
cation schemes already exist,37 no consensus has been
reached at the international level. The main objectives
of an internationally recognized system would be to
ensure the traceability of genetic resources,
increase
transparency, and combat bio-piracy.38

There are concerns with regard to the development
of too-restrictive a regime which could have negative
impacts on key areas of research. A particular concern
relates to the need for rapid access to resources in the
search for a response to infectious diseases, such as
SARS and Ebola. Exemptions or waivers should be
available to allow for easy access to genetic material in
cases of emergency requiring a quick response.39

A second proposal concerns transforming TK into
trade secrets. Cartels would be developed among com-
munities sharing the same secrets. The trade secret
could be negotiated in a Material Transfer Agreement
with the beneﬁts shared by the government and the

community concerned.40 This proposal is unappealing
as it involves secrecy, which does not promote adequate
knowledge dissemination but may raise prices of the
ﬁnal products and impede follow-up inventions.

A third option to ensure that TM is not misappro-
priated through the patent system includes ensuring
that
the patent application examination procedure
reviews and takes into account all accessible and avail-
able information contained in databases, publications,
and other sources of TK. Prior art should be inter-
preted as including public domain knowledge in any
part of the world whether published or not.

All these proposals have a defensive character in
the sense that they are aimed at impeding misappro-
priation, but they do not ensure ad hoc protection
of TK. The major practical problem of defensive pro-
tection is given by the litigation costs of opposition
proceedings or invalidity counter-claims in infringe-
ment proceedings.

Protection of TK by sui generis rights has been
criticized as lacking a moral basis

Creating a sui generis patent protection41— ensuring
positive protection to TK—is another possibility. For
example, Cottier and Panizzon have proposed the cre-
Intellectual Property Rights.42
ation of Traditional
However, protection of TK by sui generis rights has
been criticized as lacking a moral basis. It is not clear
why ‘such a community should be entitled to a special
right not available to others whose inventive predeces-
sors gave the world comparable beneﬁts’.43

Defects in an adhoc system: the case
of Chinese traditional medicine
An ad hoc IP system to protect TM may sound attrac-
tive, but it has shown major ﬂaws in practice.44 The
experience of China is a case in point.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is considered
to be the quintessence of the Chinese cultural heritage.
From a cultural perspective, TCM includes the theories
and practices of the various national minorities, and it
is particularly vulnerable because of its oral character.45
While, during the Kuomintang government, TCM
was regarded as a component of the feudal culture to
be dismantled and its practice strongly discouraged,
in 1993 China adopted a more favourable approach,
enacting the TCM prescription protection.

Special protection was needed because pharma-
ceutical patents could not be granted over most TCM.
Not only did TCM makers not know the pharmaceuti-
cally effective chemical ingredients in their drugs, but
also each TCM is often a combination of more than 20
herbs, which makes it difﬁcult to identify the most
effective compounds. While disclosure is a component
of
traditional healers were
unwilling to demonstrate their formulae publicly.

the patent application,

Prescription protection does not require disclosure.
The law grants a production monopoly for 30 or 7
years, depending on the efﬁcacy of the compound.
TCM drug-makers can apply for protection extensions
equivalent to the initial protection duration.

The existing regime protecting TCM does not
appear to be the optimal solution, there being no
balance between public and private interest. Monopoly
rights are granted without the quid pro quo of a disclos-
ure of the invention. The secrecy granted by the system
has been criticized as blocking innovation and deter-
ring adequate scrutiny on safety and efﬁcacy. Further,
the protection period is too long.

The revision draft of

the TCM protection regu-
lation seems to be a response to these complaints.46 It
shortens the protection period to 7 years in all cases
and is meant as a transitional rule. Policy makers

Cultural Rights (ICESCR), General Comment n 17
states:

In adopting measures to protect scientiﬁc,
literary and
artistic productions of indigenous peoples, States parties
should take into account their preferences.47

The indigenous organizations participating to the
ongoing debate

strongly emphasized the limited relevance of IP to the pro-
tection of TK, and consequently that any future work must
(i) involve other international organizations with more rel-
evant mandates and (ii) take customary law rather than IP
law as a starting point.48

IP does not seem to be sufﬁcient to cater for the holis-
tic and unique character of TM subject matter. The
international legal framework is much broader. Other
areas of international law, notably human rights and
cultural policies, are also part of the context for TM
protection. A balance should be reached between
respect and access to TM and beneﬁt sharing.

As Xuan Li has recently proposed, a two-layer TK
registry might be envisaged.49 The ﬁrst layer would
facilitate the identiﬁcation of TK holders; the second
would focus on new TK.50 A distinguishing feature of
new TK would be that TK already in the public domain
would be its primary input on which the whole
product development process
is based. Thus, TK
holders would be entitled to share the beneﬁts with the
downstream industry.

Several Indian government agencies have developed
the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL),51
an encyclopaedic database of the country’s TM. The
TKDL has been established in close collaboration with
local community members. It contains information on
TM,
including exhaustive references, photographs of
the plants, and scans from the original texts.

The outstanding value of the initiative lies, ﬁrst, in
the fact that it will prevent bio-piracy (when the encyclo-
paedia’s contents are made publicly available, no one
will be able to claim that these medicines or therapies
are their inventions). All national patent ofﬁces should
be able to access local innovation databases when car-
rying out prior art searches and examinations.

Second, ancient

texts in Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic,
Persian, and Tamil are systematically translated into
international
such as English, French,
German, and Spanish.52 This ensures a broader access
to TM while ensuring its preservation.

languages

Third, TKDL has immense potential for being uti-
lized as a tool for advancing research at low cost (there
being fewer chances of drug failure at the end of the
pipeline). Individual and collective TK holders would
receive acknowledgement and ﬁnancial rewards for
commercial applications of their knowledge.

The idea underlying this domaine public payant53 is
based on the fact that TK is not a static concept and
may evolve to become new TK. Further, it acknowl-
edges
the indigenous people’s vision under which
human beings are only the custodians of the riches and
natural resources of Earth.54

In more general terms, making heritage legible55 is a
desirable goal. This means documenting and preserving
TK created in the past which may be on the brink of
disappearance. However, any database initiative must
be preceded by full consideration of possible IP impli-
cations,
including inadvertently placing TK in the
public domain or publishing it inappropriately.

These approaches, based on recognizing moral and
economic rights in a co-operative way with modern
science, have the merit to help safeguard TM as cul-
tural heritage through a systematic restatement of its
contents. The systematization and codiﬁcation of this
knowledge would avoid its disappearance,
further
enhancing its vitality as a possible source of further
research and development of new drugs.

Towards a Medical Research
and Development Treaty?
With regard to pharmaceutical R&D, the recent draft
Medical Research and Development Treaty (MRDT)56
has been debated at the United Nations World Health
Assembly. This Treaty would create ‘a new global
framework for supporting medical research and devel-
opment, based upon equitable sharing of the costs of
research and development in the areas of need and
public interest’57 while recognizing ‘human rights and
the goal of all sharing in the beneﬁts of scientiﬁc
advancement’.58

The MRDT provides state obligations for minimum
levels of investment in medical research and develop-
ment, processes for priority setting, and incentives to
support medical research and development, broader
dissemination of scientiﬁc information and knowledge
and enhanced transfer of technology.59 It also contains
provisions that member countries reduce IP protection
in certain areas, to permit exceptions to patentability
relating to certain open source medical databases,
increasing ﬂexibility in issuing compulsory licensing
and in broadly interpreting research exception.

The core country obligation is to support medical
R&D. According to the MRDT, medical
research
includes basic research, development of biomedical
databases, development of pharmaceutical drugs, and
the preservation and dissemination of TM knowledge.60

The project to develop a treaty on medical research and development
began in 2002, and has been discussed at numerous workshops,
conferences, and meetings. This effort has produced a working draft. In
late May 2006, the WHO’s Executive Board approved a highly bracketed
version of a draft resolution on this topic, which was debated at the
WHO’s World Health Assembly (EB117.R13). On 27 May 2006, the
WHA adopted a milestone resolution (WHA59.24), establishing an
intergovernmental working group open to all interested member states to
develop a global plan on medical research and development.

It provides for state obligations even with regard to
priority medical research and development with regard
to areas such as vaccine development, neglected dis-
eases, and global infectious diseases.61

The mechanisms provided by the draft include tra-
ditional approaches such as national public sector
funding, tax exemptions, philanthropic expenditures,
or collective purchasing of patented medicines as well
as newer methods such as medical
innovation prize
funds62 and open source collaborative research projects.
Parties are free to decide on speciﬁc investments and
ﬁnance mechanisms.

Countries’ obligations are tailored according to their
Gross Domestic Product, under a progressive rate.
Similarly to the Kyoto Protocol,63 the proposal also
creates a system of credits to reward and stimulate
investments in research projects considered of social
importance. Also, credits could be traded across
borders and countries that exceed the benchmark obli-
gations can sell excess credits.64

Among the socially important projects are R&D for
neglected diseases, open public goods, open medical
databases, projects that involve transfer of technology
to developing countries and exceptionally useful public
projects.

The proposal must be welcomed as it represents a
paradigm shift. It seeks to look at the issue of R&D of
new pharmaceuticals from a public health perspective
instead of the commercial point of view, as it is refo-
cusing the debate away from drug prices and patents
and towards
it
acknowledges the role played by TM in primary health
care. The proposal is a reasonable alternative to the
status quo. While some authors have opposed it,66 the
goal of increasing state funding of R&D appears highly
desirable.

innovation and access.65 Crucially,

One may envisage the MRDT as a framework con-
vention expressing general principles and goals, with
some detailed provisions that would be binding upon

the signatories. It is, however, encouraging that these
negotiations are conducted under the aegis of
the
WHO,67 not by more commercially driven organiz-
ations such as the WTO or even the WIPO.

Summary: a need for reconciliation
In the developing world, the real challenge is how to
regulate the content of the law. IP does not appear
entirely suitable for protecting TM for both cultural
and practical reasons. A non-proprietary approach is
proposed, aimed at
recognizing both moral and
material interests of indigenous people.

Knowledge governance in the medical ﬁeld is funda-
mentally related to a collection of human rights, not
only to cultural and intellectual rights but also to the
right to health. The right of
indigenous people to
beneﬁt from the protection of the moral and material
interests resulting from their scientiﬁc productions
cannot be isolated from the other human rights.

Access to medicines is a key component of the right
to health. As such, it is a fundamental human right,
expressly recognized in a series of international and
regional treaties.68

The Universal Declaration on Human Rights refers
to the right to medical care (Article 25) and the right
to share in the beneﬁts of scientiﬁc advancement
(Article 27). Article 12 of the ICESCR recognizes ‘the
right of everyone to the enjoyment of
the highest
attainable standards of physical and mental health’.69 As
the Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights Committee
adds, States are bound to promote the right to health
through ensuring access to affordable treatment.70

TM plays a fundamental role as bridging the gap
between different health systems and ensuring satisfac-
tion of primary health needs in developing and least
developed countries.71 Its preservation and enhance-
ment may even play a role in industrialized countries,

and experienced in their work; (iii) economic considerations; (iv) the vast
distances to be covered in some countries; and (v) the shortage of health
professionals, particularly in rural areas.
