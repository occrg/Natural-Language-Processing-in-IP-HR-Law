Is there free-riding? A comparative analysis of
the problem of protecting publishing
materials online in Europe1
Silvia Scalzini*

The old and the new
The battle between old and new intermediaries in the
digital environment is well known.2 New intermediaries
are arising in the information value chain. These new
actors have at times challenged the role of traditional
press publishers and news organizations, which have had
to ﬁnd strategies to retain revenue and return on their
investment in the internet. Indeed, information produc-
tion and distribution online have greatly changed when
compared with the traditional models in the analogue
world. According to a study by the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development,3 the drivers of
change in online news include new technologies, chan-
ging media use and social factors (such as changing in-
formation consumption) and the business models of
internet intermediaries.

Given the ubiquity of the internet, the same problem
has emerged worldwide:4 the legitimacy of the activity of
search engines and news aggregators in indexing and
displaying news and articles.

This issue has been debated on various occasions,
legislation and even competition. The
in litigation,
discussion has mainly focused on the application of
copyright law to such conduct, with special attention
given to the nature of linking and publishing extracts
of text.

The excessive emphasis on copyright law as the main
solution to the problem, however, has been read by some
commentators as an exploitation of those rules in order
to protect certain business interests to the detriment of

The problem is made more complex by the fact that
some of these new players have achieved high market
share in digital copyright-related markets.6 The most

The fundamental question that

the legal policy-
makers should ask themselves is whether the activity of
new intermediaries is purely ‘parasitic’ or whether it is
useful in fostering development and innovation. To what
extent should it be blocked or enhanced?

Such a choice touches the very heart of the function-
ing of the internet and its players. In essence, it is a ques-
tion of deciding (if and) how to regulate this ﬁeld, so as
to adequately balance incentives for creativity and in-
vestment, innovation and access to information. Given
the ubiquity of the internet, such a choice should be con-
ceived at a supranational level and carefully considered
before drastic solutions are proposed.9

After an overview of the functioning of new inter-
mediaries, the problem is considered from an economic
and political perspective. Then, after examining the
effects of the existing case law, this article analyses the

allegations that Google Inc has abused a dominant position in online search,

specialized search services in a more prominent manner than services of
competitors and using content from competing specialized search services

Overview of the functioning of new
intermediaries
New intermediaries are essentially concerned with infor-
mation collection, aggregation and display. In particular,
news aggregators are ‘websites that take information
from multiple sources and display it in a single place’.10
They can take many forms. They can be general or spe-
ciﬁc, free or fee-based, web or email-based, and with or
without original content.

Their innovative business model is to attract trafﬁc
and occasionally revenue ‘by hosting collections of links
to the content of others’.11 These services usually display
a hyperlinked headline to a news story with a short
extract of text (snippet) and the source. Well-known
aggregators include Google News, Yahoo News and the
Hufﬁngton Post.

Most news aggregators, such as Google News,12 also
operate on an opt-out basis, indexing web pages automat-
ically through a web crawler programme. The indexing
works without seeking the ex ante permission of website
owners and it ‘algorithmically aggregates headlines and
groups similar articles together.13 Usually website owners
can only opt out of the services and so avoid the indexing

without their consent. The two other concerns relate to online advertising
and in particular to Google’s behaviour of imposing exclusivity agreements
on publishers who wanted to use its advertising programmes, as well as
imposing restrictions on advertisers who were using those programmes.

in whole or in part through technical standards, such as
Robot Exclusion Protocols and ACAP.14 Some of these
services have a cache function, which allows them to
create copies of web pages and store them in a cache
memory.

These players have successfully entered the informa-
tion distribution value chain because of the efﬁciency
they create for their users by decreasing the cost of
searching for relevant information. They can also beneﬁt
content owners by enhancing the visibility of their web-
sites and increasing their appeal as advertising loca-
tions.15 Finally, in general terms, they increase the free
ﬂow of information, access to knowledge and freedom of
speech. Since their activity relies on the use of the origin-
al content of others, its legitimacy has been questioned.
Traditional press publishers have accused them of free-
riding, complaining about the systematic use of their
content by these services without obtaining prior
consent and without sharing the additional value gener-
ated from their original stories.16

In response, news aggregators often sustain that pub-
lishers’ claims are essentially ﬁnancial and protectionist
in nature, to the extent that they try to ‘put the brakes’
on a new market service.17

The debate focuses in particular on whether and how
copyright law is able to effectively manage these conﬂict-
ing issues, even if the problem has also affected unfair
competition and antitrust law.18

Free-riding? To what extent should these
activities be blocked?
If one considers matters from an economic and political
perspective, it is easy to see that, while there is a need to

protect creative content (and investments in professional
creative content by news organizations) from free-riding
on the internet, these innovative services create efﬁciency
for users, increase the free ﬂow of information, access to
knowledge and free speech and ﬁnally undertake invest-
ments in innovative aggregation and search services.
Moreover, regarding their functioning, hyperlinks and
snippets of text have become part of normal use of the
internet.

Are there also efﬁciencies for traditional press pub-
lishers? The answer may be positive. Search engines and
news aggregators drive, or could drive, additional trafﬁc
to their websites.19 However, they appropriate some ad-
vertising revenue that could otherwise go to the content
sites (in addition to reader loyalty20) and some behav-
ioural studies have underlined a possible substitutive
effect.21 In economic terms one can say that

aggregators are beneﬁcial to content sites only to the extent
that their presence attracts sufﬁcient additional visitors to
the content ecosystem to offset the advertising revenue they
[take away] from content creators.22 (citation omitted)

Moreover, aggregators and search engines also affect
content quality due to the competition they generate
among content websites.23 It is thus questioned whether
market developments could be an efﬁcient mechanism
for sharing the additional resources produced.

The challenge is to ﬁgure out which is the best form
of regulation (if there is one) to encourage efﬁcient
forms of collaboration, at the same time as safeguarding
diversity and a pluralistic and fair digital environment.
The problem is highly complex. Here, we consider the
latest European developments and their effects in order
to understand where the balance is tipped to date.

What about copyright law?
Patterns in national courts: between copyright
infringement and lawful use of content
The case law of European national courts underlines the
uncertainties of dealing with this issue.

The litigation focuses especially on the scope of copy-
right law. The main problems raised in terms of copy-
right have concerned news, headlines and snippets of
articles as copyright subject matters, the qualiﬁcation of
the activity of new intermediaries as acts of exploitation
of materials protected by copyright24 or not, as well as
the deﬁnition of the scope of applicable exceptions and
limitations or fair dealing.25 Within these proceedings,
claims have arisen also regarding unfair competition,
abuse of right and the existence of implied licenses.

Decisions in Europe have addressed these issues in
different ways, because of the interests involved. A ﬁrst
group of decisions afﬁrmed copyright infringement and
narrowly interpreted copyright exceptions.26 Here we
mention the Belgian decision in Copiepresse SCRL et al v
Google Inc and the English decision in Newspaper Licens-
ing Agency Ltd and others v Meltwater Holding BV and
others.27

Copiepresse SCRL et al v Google Inc28 involved the
well-known news aggregator Google News (Belgique)
and the collective management organizations for Belgian
newspaper publishers in French and German languages,
Copiepresse, and for journalists and scholarly authors,
SAJ and Assucopie. In the ﬁrst and second instances the
Courts condemned Google for copyright infringement,
although the latter decision was appealed to the Belgian
Cour de Cassation and the lawsuit was settled before the
ﬁnal decision.29 The Cour d0Appel de Bruxelles found
Google liable for infringing the rights of reproduction
and communication to the public both with its cache
function and with its news service. Considering the ﬁrst

24 According to Articles 2-4 of Directive 2001/29 on the harmonisation
aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (the
‘Infosoc Directive’), these acts include reproduction, communication to the
public of works and making available to the public other subject matter
and distribution.

25 See Article 5 of the Infosoc Directive (n 24).
26 For this analysis see also M. Stanganelli, ‘Spreading the News Online:

A Fine Balance Of Copyright And Freedom Of Expression In News
Aggregation’ (2012) EIPR, 34(11), 745 –753.

27 See below. For other less recent cases, like Danish Newspaper Publishers’

Association v Newsbooster.com ApS, 7 May 2002, Denmark Bailiff ’s Court,

aspect, the Court excluded application of the exemption
either as a temporary copying in Article 5(1) of the
Infosoc Directive or under the cache copying safe
harbour in Article 13 of the E-commerce Directive.30
With regard to the news service,
it conﬁrmed that
Google had reproduced and communicated to the
public materials protected by copyright (headlines and
extracts of text) and deemed the statutory limitations in-
applicable.31 Moreover, it conﬁrmed the infringement of
the moral rights of the authors32 and rejected ‘Google’s
alternative arguments’.33 In particular, the Court denied
the existence of an implied licence deriving from the fact
that the publishers had not implemented the technical
measure to opt out of Google’s service34 and rejected
Google’s demand for the right ‘to freely disseminate in-
formation’ in reference to Article 10 of the European
Convention for Human Rights.35 Finally, the Court did
not qualify the publishers’ conduct as an abuse of law,36
as Google claimed, nor did it consider the lawsuit
against Google anti-competitive behaviour by Copie-
presse. The Court considered this last argument un-
founded, there being no evidence that Copiepresse had
engaged in concerted practices to prevent, restrict or
falsify the game of competition, nor had it abused its
dominant position in order to eliminate Google News-
competition.37

In Great Britain, an interesting and much-discussed
case involved the media monitoring agency Meltwater, a
service that provides its clients with every reference
within a deﬁned period to speciﬁc keywords, by moni-
toring and indexing online media websites. The clients
can access the Meltwater news service either by opening
the email alert sent by the agency or by visiting the
website. Meltwater results include a hyperlink to every
article containing the search term, the headline and
the opening words as well as an extract of the article
showing the search term. The England and Wales Court

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2015, Vol. 10, No. 6

of Appeal38 conﬁrmed the decision of the High Court,39
afﬁrming the copyright infringement and the conse-
quent need for a licence (from the collecting society
Newspaper Licensing Agency) not only for Meltwater’s
site but also for the users of that site, though distinguish-
ing the situation of fee-based services from those of
free services.40 Both courts considered that, in most
instances, the headlines and the scrapings constituted
work protected by copyright or a substantial part of a
work protected by copyright.41 The copy made by the
end-user’s computer by opening the email from Melt-
water or accessing the Meltwater website and clicking on
the links to the articles thus, ‘prima facie, an infringe-
ment of the Publishers’ copyright0.42 As far as the excep-
tions and limitations were concerned,
the Courts
excluded the application of s.28A Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA) dealing with temporary
copies, s.30 CDPA as fair dealing for criticism, review
and news reporting, and the Database Regulation. There
was no fair dealing because the activities in question did
not fall within the purposes of criticism and review,43 or
the reporting of current events.44 In short, according to
the judges, Meltwater’s dealing was for commercial pur-
poses and was encouraging end-users to infringe pub-
lishers’ copyright.45 The Court of Appeal decision was
appealed to the UK Supreme Court,46 which in turn
made a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice of
the European Union (CJEU)47 regarding the interpret-
ation of the temporary copy limitation in the case of
users browsing protected content online. The UK
Supreme Court asked whether an end-user, who merely
browses the Meltwater web page without downloading,
printing or otherwise setting out to make a copy of it,

48 See P. Joseph and A. Cusworth ‘Meltwater: Liability For internet Browsing’

(2014) JIPLP 9 (11): 885– 887. According to these authors, ‘the CJEU’s
justiﬁcation as to why the creation of the temporary copies was a ‘special
case’ under Article 5(5) . . . works where the content is lawful and has been
properly put into circulation by the rights holder’.

49 Outside Europe, an important decision that has shared this approach is

Fairfax Media Pubs Pty Ltd v Reed International Books Australia Pty, [2010]
FCA 984 (Federal Court Australia), http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgibin/
sinodisp/au/cases/cth/FCA/2010/984.html?stem=0&synonyms=0
&query=title%28fairfax%20media%20and%20Reed%20%29. The FCA,
after denying the copyright protection for newspapers’ headlines, deemed

the conditions of Article 5(1) of

requires a licence from the copyright holders of the
content reproduced by the service or whether the screen
copy and automatically created cached copy of the
website fulﬁl
the
InfoSoc Directive. Fortunately for internet end-users,
the CJEU stated that the copies satisﬁed not only the
fourth and the ﬁfth conditions of Article 5 (1), as already
stated by the referring Court, but also the ﬁrst three con-
ditions: to be temporary, to be transient or incidental in
nature and to constitute an integral and essential part of
a technological process. The Court added that the cached
copies also satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 5(5)
of Directive 2001/29. Indeed, the carrying out of a tem-
porary act of reproduction is exempt from the reproduc-
tion right only in certain special cases that do not conﬂict
with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unrea-
sonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights
holders. According to the Court, onscreen copies and
cached copies constitute a special case, since they are
created only for the purpose of viewing websites; they do
not prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights holders,
who have already authorized the works to be made avail-
able by the publisher of the website visited, and they
cannot operate to the detriment of the normal exploit-
ation of the works. While this decision determined that
such copies do not require the authorization of the copy-
right-holder, some commentators have observed that this
casts a shadow on the conduct of those who ‘unwittingly
browse or link to infringing content’.48

A second group of decisions, through a more ‘ﬂexible’
interpretation of copyright exceptions, did not afﬁrm
copyright infringement49 and considered lawful that use
of others’ content.50

the conduct of reproducing and communicating the headlines as part of
the Abstracts as fair dealing ‘for the purpose of reporting news such that
conduct would not constitute an infringement of copyright by reason of
s 42(1)(b) of the [Australian Copyright Act]’. According to the Court, ‘the
use of titles of articles and books for the purposes of identiﬁcation is well-
known and routine, even more so today for the purposes of Internet
searches’.

50 For the analysis of less recent cases as PCM v Algemeen Dagblad B.V. v
Eureka Internetdiensten, District Court of Rotterdam, August 22, 2000;
[2002] E.C.D.R., see G. J. H. Smith, Internet Law and Regulation, (n 27), 70
ff. An important decision on this matter, although it was issued before the
implementation of the InfoSoc Directive (n 24), is the German case
PaperBoy Bundesgerichtshof (BGH), 17 July 2003, case I WR 259/00. Here,
the Federal Court of Justice found that neither the adoption of short
fragments of the articles nor the setting of the deep links amounted to an
infringement under Section 16 Urheberrechtsgesetz. Then the BGH rejected
the argument that Paperboy service infringes the sui generis rights of
Section 87b(1) UrhG accorded to the maker of a database, afﬁrming, in
particular that ‘the utilization of the short fragments did not replace but
rather stimulated the further use of the databases by allowing users to
decide whether or not an article was of interest to them’. Finally, regarding
the claim of unfair competition, the Court found that the respondent ‘was
offering a distinctly separate and useful service, which of course built on
the existence of publicly available articles on the World Wide Web’. It

ARTICLE

459

In France, the Tribunal de Grande Instance (TGI) of
Nancy51 rejected the claims by two French regional news-
papers, Le journal de Saoˆne-et-Loire and Le Bien public,
which accused online newspaper Dijonscope of copyright
infringement and unfair competition. On its website,
Dijonscope had a section entitled ‘revue du web’, in which
it collected links to articles from other information
website and displayed their headlines, the date and time of
the original publications and a few sentences as an intro-
duction. Concerning the copyright infringement, the TGI
ﬁrst afﬁrmed that linking, albeit deep linking, did not con-
stitute an act of infringement. According to the Court, it
merely displayed some links that allowed users to view the
original websites, on which the ‘repre´sentation’ was made.
With regard to the reproduction of extracts of text, the
Court considered the conduct of Dijonscope to be an act
of ‘reproduction partielle’ under Article L122-4 of the
Code de la Proprie´te´ Intellectuelle. Nevertheless such acts
could be exempted by the ‘exception de courtes citations’
(quotation exception), since Dijonscope always mentioned
the prior publication of the works and the clear enunci-
ation of their authors and sources.52 The ‘exception de
revue de presse’ was not considered applicable. With
respect to unfair competition (more correctly ‘concurrence
de´loyale’), the plaintiffs accused Dijonscope of generating
a risk of confusion and altering their ranking by search
engines, resulting in a ‘de´tournement de cliente`le’(custo-
mer poaching). The Court denied the existence of such a
risk, given that users could not seriously misunderstand
the source of the article consulted. Finally the Tribunal
held that the other claims of the two newspapers (the pos-
sibility of viewing pages amended or withdrawn from the
original websites and the possibility of circumventing the
paywalls) were insufﬁciently proven.

Another important ruling is Megakini.com v Google
Spain, issued by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2012.53
This did not concern a news aggregator but a search
engine, Google Spain. It is signiﬁcant because of its

reading of the ‘three-step-test’ as a ﬂexible clause in the
application of copyright statutes.54

The case involved the qualiﬁcation as copyright in-
fringement of
the unauthorized reproduction and
making available of a website’s content by Google Spain.
In particular, the issue concerned the partial reproduc-
tion of extracts of website text content in Google search
results, as well as the reproduction and making available
of cached copies of web pages through the Google cache
service. The Supreme Court (SC) conﬁrmed the rulings
of the lower courts, dismissing the infringement action.
According to the Court, in principle, the making avail-
able of cached copies requires the prior authorization of
the copyright holder.55 The reproduction of extracts of
text is characterized by its insigniﬁcance and its aims to
guide the user. The SC then afﬁrmed that the interpret-
ative value of the three-step-test is not only negative,
but also positive,
‘incorporating the speciﬁcities of
the general principles of the law into the copyright
statute’:56 the doctrine of the ius usus inocui, the prin-
ciple of good faith (Art. 7.1 Civil Code), the prohibition
of abuse of right (abuso del derecho o del ejercicio antisocial
del mismo, under Art. 7.2 Civil Code), as well as the
Spanish constitutional construction of property as a non-
absolute right. Therefore, it is appropriate for a Court to
analyse, in particular, whether the unauthorized repro-
duction of a work can concretely cause damage to the ‘le-
gitimate interests’ of the author or affect the normal
exploitation of the work or whether it favours such inter-
ests and such exploitation. Since the activity of Google
beneﬁts the applicant by providing general access to its
website and knowledge of its content, the Supreme Court
concluded that the claim intended merely to hurt Google
without getting any personal gain, resulting arbitrary.57
Finally the Court clariﬁed that it did not intend to intro-
duce a new statutory limitation or legitimize all of
Google’s activities.58 Simply, the protection of the derecho
de autor and the narrow interpretation of its limitations

dismissed the risk of confusion and rejected the argument that the use of
deep links violated legitimate interests in bypassing advertisements placed
on the homepages from which a user would normally begin his or her
search. See J. Stemplewitz, Report - Bundesgerichtshof-Zivilsachen (Federal
Court of Justice-Private Law) 2003, R. Miller and P. Zumbansen (eds),

could not allow for abusive claims, intended only to harm
third parties.

This short case overview shows the interests, the
claims and the defences of the various players, as well as
the different evaluations by the courts. These decisions
have often depended on their speciﬁc facts and on the
type of service considered, as well as on the different in-
terpretation of each statutory copyright system.

The focal point of the debate has been the edge of
the level of imitation allowed, according to copyright
law’s aims. Indeed, domestic courts increasingly face the
problem of interpreting the current legal tools with
respect to new uses in the internet. The results often
depend on the weight given to some interests rather than
others. For instance, some courts have given greater
weight to the interests of the right holders, especially
when the acts of exploitations have been put in place by
commercial services (Meltwater), while others have
found that such acts could be exempted by existing
exemptions and limitations, thus dispensing with the
need for a licence (Dijonscope). Moreover, some deci-
sions deemed the claims of the plaintiffs abusive on the
ground of the three-step test (Megakini), while others
reject that argument (Copiepresse).

As Professor Ginsburg has noted, ‘different outcomes
in different jurisdictions can complicate the business
planning of web-based enterprises whose users may be
located across the globe’.59

EU insights: the CJEU interpretation of
Directive 2001/29 on linking and extracts
The problem of classifying news intermediaries’ activ-
ities has recently been considered before the CJEU,
which has interpreted Directive 2001/29 on the activity
of linking and providing extracts of third party content.
The consequences of these rulings may be relevant for
new intermediaries functioning in Europe and for their
possibly being regarded as parasitic, as well as for the
harmonisation of copyright norms.

The most important ruling is Svensson.60 The main
proceedings concerned a claim for compensation for the

harm resulting from the unauthorized inclusion on a
company’s website of hyperlinks redirecting users to
press articles in which the applicants held the copyright.
The CJEU afﬁrmed that the provision on a website of
clickable links to works freely available on another
website is not an ‘act of communication to the public’.61
First, considering the criterion of act of communica-
tion, it stated that the provision of clickable links to pro-
tected works must be considered to be making available
those works and, therefore, is an act of communication.62
It then analysed the criterion of communication to the
public and, in particular, according to the settled case law,
communication to a new public, afﬁrming that there is
no new public if the protected work is published and
freely accessible. The Court concluded that, in the absence
of a new public, such communication to the public did
not require the authorization of the copyright holder.
Otherwise, if the link had been used to circumvent the
restrictions placed by the copyright holder (for example,
to give access only to subscribers), the communication
would have been directed to a new public and the supplier
of the link would have required permission so as not to
infringe copyright.

While this ruling may seem reassuring in many

respects, it raises more questions than it answers.

So far as is relevant here, according to the reasoning
of the Court, the act of linking is an act of communica-
tion not directed to a new public, because the original
content, to which the link redirects the user, is freely
available online. The quasi-subjective criterion of a ‘new
public’, namely ‘a public that was not taken into account
by the copyright holders when they authorized the initial
communication to the public’,63 raises doubts regarding
the real meaning of the expression ‘freely available’. For
instance, should the terms and conditions set by the
copyright holder be considered?64 If so, what about the
functionality of news aggregators, which is based, for in-
stance, on an opt-out basis? Nor is the Court clear as to
the relevant moment for determining when content is
freely accessible.65 From the statement of the Court, it
seems that ‘what matters is no longer just the initial act
of communication, but rather the circumstance that the

60 Judgment in Svensson v Retriever Sverige AB, C-466/12, EU:C:2014:76.
61 According to Article 3(1) of Infosoc Directive (n 24), every act of

communication of a work to the public has to be authorised by the
copyright holder. The concept of communication to the public includes
two cumulative criteria, namely, an ‘act of communication’ of a work and
the communication of that work to a ‘public’.

work remains freely available on the internet all the
time’.66 This appears to be introducing a sort of duty to
monitor the actual ‘free availability’ of the content.

The answers to these questions could inﬂuence the
consideration of the activity of new intermediaries to a
great extent, as well as, in general terms, the whole func-
tioning of the web.67

In the same decision, the CJEU afﬁrmed that a
member state cannot give protection to copyright
holders by asserting a wider concept of communication
to the public.68

This interpretation is surely intended to increase legal
certainty within the EU, regarding, in particular, new
changes in national copyright laws in order to protect
press publishers.69

As mentioned, national courts have also dealt with
the problem of the consideration of news, headlines and
extracts of articles as copyright subject matter. A few
words should be thus devoted to another important de-
cision of the CJEU, concerning the standard of original-
ity of a work and, in particular, of newspaper articles: the
‘Infopaq I’ decision.70 According to the Court, even an
extract of a protected work comprising 11 words may be
original if the fragment is the expression of the intellec-
tual creation of their author. Anyway, ‘it is for the na-
tional court to make this determination’71; therefore,
setting originality standard in headlines and extracts is
left to national judges. However, the decision has had an
important impact on some national systems, because of
the light that it has thrown on the assessment of the in-
tellectual creation of the author. In United Kingdom, for
example, the application of the ‘Infopaq test’ in News-
paper Licensing Agency Ltd and others v Meltwater

Holding BV and others, in the opinion of some commen-
tators, has shown a shift toward a more ‘qualitative di-
mension’ of the evaluation of protected-subject matter.72
Surely the legal framework of new internet uses and
players should be clariﬁed within the process of the
modernization of EU copyright73 in order to strike the
most appropriate balance between the competing inter-
ests in the digital environment.

Statutory responses and their limits
Given these uncertainties, some countries have consid-
ered the option of expanding intellectual property rights
in order to prevent free-riding and to obtain revenue
from news aggregators and search engines.

In 2013, Germany adopted an amendment to the
Urheberrechtsgesetz (German Copyright Act) and issued an
ancillary copyright for Press Publishers (Leistungsschutz-
recht fu¨r Presseverleger)74 whereby the commercial use of
press products on the internet, particularly by search
engine providers and news aggregators, is subject to an ex-
clusive right. Under these rules, press publishers have the
exclusive right to make their content publicly available for
commercial purposes. This right
is transferable and
expires one year after the publication. The making avail-
able of such content, in whole or in part, by third parties is
authorized, except for commercial operators of search
engines or commercial news aggregators. Unlike the ﬁrst
version of the bill, no fees need be paid for displaying
single words or small extracts of text, the deﬁnition of
which, however, is not provided by the law.

This amendment,75 which is at the centre of intense
debate,76 is the ﬁrst concrete attempt in Europe to

communicated or where it is henceforth available on that site only to a
restricted public, while being accessible on another Internet site without
the copyright holders’ authorization.’

provide an alternative model for regulating these activ-
ities.77 The effects of these amendments are now being
put to the test.

As some far-sighted scholars have pointed out, ‘the
new ancillary copyright law itself does not accommodate
the publishers’ ﬁnancial interests’.78 Indeed, they ‘are not
(at least not primarily) interested in exercising a right to
exclude content, rather they are much more concerned
with signing paid-for licensing agreements’79. The latest
developments in Germany80 have conﬁrmed this theory.
The largest search engine, Google, refused to enter into
negotiations in order to stipulate paid-for licensing
agreements to display publishers’ content. To date the
law has not worked as leverage to encourage Google to
pay press publishers who, instead, have had to face the
alternative to opt into the service and either consent for
their content to be used free of charge or have it
removed (or signiﬁcantly reduced) from the display on
the famous news aggregator. The collective management
society VG Media Group, which represents many of the
main press publishers in Germany, complained that
press publishers have been forced to give their free
consent
‘given the overwhelming market power of
Google’81. It also claimed that ‘lost revenues caused by a
fall in trafﬁc as a result of Google not using their extracts
could trigger bankruptcies’.82 It is easy to see that the
next step in this strategy will be to force the search
engine to index the content for a fee.

Now the matter has moved to the courts and to the
federal competition authority. The Bundeskartellamt,
has been asked for a clariﬁcation,83 while the VG Media

Group has issued a civil action84 in order to deﬁne the
exact scope of the press ancillary copyright.

Following the German legislative path, Spain recently
adopted an Intellectual Property Law Reform, Ley 21/
201485 that, among other things, introduces a speciﬁc
statutory limitation for internet service providers and
content aggregators, subject to an inalienable equitable
compensation. This new limitation authorizes the use of
‘non-signiﬁcant fragments of content’ previously pub-
lished in newspapers of periodically updated websites,
‘which are directed at forming public opinion or have
informational or entertainment purposes’.86
It also
establishes the right to obtain an equitable, unwaivable
and collectively managed remuneration for publishers
and other right holders. In addition, the new Article,
32(2), excludes images and photography from the scope
of the limitation and afﬁrms that the making available of
pieces of information by search engines shall not be
subject to either authorization or compensation, when
the use is non-commercial, necessary to provide results
to a speciﬁc user’s search and is combined with the
display of the link to the original source.

This convoluted rule clearly aims at creating a new le-
gislative model, different from the German one because
of its compulsory nature. While within the German
model there is room for voluntary negotiation, the
Spanish law lays down a compulsory fee even for the use
of non-signiﬁcant (but protectable?) fragments of text.
The law has already had an immediate impact, namely
the removal of Spanish publishers from Google News
and the closure of Google News in Spain.87 Was it the

desired effect? Will there be any beneﬁciaries? A detailed
analysis of all of the implications of these statutes goes
beyond the scope of this comparative survey.

In order to answer the main question above men-

tioned, at least two arguments are to be considered.

First, the level of ‘imitation’ permitted is unclear. The
two statutes leave some concepts unspeciﬁed, such as a
‘small snippet of text’ or ‘non-signiﬁcant fragments of
content’ as well as the ‘commercial purpose’ of the activ-
ity of search engines and news aggregators. The matter
of determining the scope of the statutes will move to the
courts of the respective countries. They will have the
burden not only of setting the standard of originality of
a text, but also of drafting the boundaries of the statu-
tory limitation of copyright, with the risk of adversely
impacting the functioning of the EU market and the har-
monisation of EU rules.88

Further, while these rules are intended to limit the sys-
tematic use of original content, they may have the effect
of blocking the development of new business models
and new services, thereby curbing innovation. Indeed, as
the Spanish Comision Nacional de los Mercados y la
Competencia89 pointed out, the new Spanish law may
affect in a discriminatory manner the entry of new
operators into the market of news aggregators to the
beneﬁt of consolidated incumbents. Since these new
operators may not have the ﬁnancial capacity to pay the
publishers, these reforms could harm consumers,
in
terms of competitive tension, variety of bidders and
technological innovation.90 Further, these reforms may
discourage publishers from developing efﬁcient business
models to recover their investments on the internet and
they may limit the visibility of small producers and sup-
pliers of original content.

In essence, such intervention on intellectual property
rights, beside not to create signiﬁcant incentives to cre-
ativity and innovation, may have the effect of limiting
access to information.

In order to encourage innovation and market develop-
ments, for instance, France, which initially considered a
change to the Code de la proprie´te´ intellectuelle,91 decided
to support a private agreement between French press pub-
lishers and Google.92 The agreement provides for a fund of

60 million euros supplied by Google in order to support
digital transition and investments and innovations to the
beneﬁt of the press ‘d’information politique et ge´ne´rale’.
The French President, Franc¸ois Hollande, afﬁrmed that a
global event has occurred with a global ﬁrm, a national
press and a government, where the players have been able
to freely negotiate.93

Even though the decision follows a market develop-
ment path, such an action may have anti-competitive
effects, due to having only supported a single large new
intermediary, Google,94 further strengthening its pos-
ition, with the risk of transform this big private ﬁrm as
the bottleneck of information.

It is difﬁcult to assess which is the preferable approach
to this problem. The models so far followed in Europe
have shown their limits. The French pattern is likely to
beneﬁt some players only, while the two legislative
models seem to be inefﬁcient.

There is a need to better deﬁne the scope of copyright
law and the level of imitation permitted in the digital en-
vironment, but this cannot take place through ad hoc
rules addressed to speciﬁc players (which, moreover,
seem to be identiﬁed with mere empirical criteria) and
without a more general overview.

It is, however, evident that the effects of the national
choices are always measured and inﬂuenced by the
responses implemented by Google. For better or worse,
given its economic power and its success among users,
Google is dictating the rules of the game. Thus more
attention should perhaps be devoted to exploring
whether publishers’ behaviour can really be independent
of Google.

Thorny problems, new tools
As shown above, the problem is very complex and it
does not have a single solution. The disparate interpreta-
tions of judges and policymakers depend on the weight
that legal systems give to some interests rather than
others. The trend that has arisen from some ﬁrst Euro-
pean regulatory attempts consists of a change to intellec-
tual property rules in order to encourage (or even force)
cooperation between old and new intermediaries.

However, the solution to this thorny problem does
not necessarily lie in copyright law, although there is,
without doubt, a problem related to better deﬁning the
scope of copyright law in relation to new digital uses and
new subjects, whose solution should be shared at supra-
national level, given the size of the markets involved and
the nature of the internet. Copyright law pursues certain
goals, which are to be achieved through a delicate
balance of interests that should consider right holders,

users and the public, especially in the digital environ-
ment. Such intervention on intellectual property rights
may have the effect of limiting access to information to a
large extent, against the creation of reduced incentives to
creativity and innovation.

Perhaps the real problem goes beyond the new uses of
protected materials on the internet and is intertwined
with political issues, competition law and tax law. The
real problem may need to be solved using other tools.
