Evidence-Based Intellectual Property Policymaking:
An Integrated Review of Methods and Conclusions

Jeremy de Beer
Faculty of Law, University of Ottawa

Governments have long been interested in making intellectual property (IP) policy based on sound evidence. There is a
large body of literature addressing the economic impacts of IP, but little of it is accessible to policy makers. This article
aims to improve understanding of how IP contributes to the economic performance of a country’s innovative sectors. A
detailed literature review and meta-analysis identiﬁes existing methodologies and analytical frameworks. The article
organizes the literature and conclusions into four major archetypes, and explains the advantages/disadvantages of each
approach. First, data for advocacy is used primarily by special-interest lobby groups. This literature is accessible to
policy makers, but rarely transparent, veriﬁed or peer reviewed. Second, valuations of aggregate economic
contributions of IP-related industries are inﬂuential worldwide. This literature usefully allows us to compare data
internationally, but makes unfounded or misleading assumptions about the importance of IP to a particular industry.
Third, innovation indices and rankings are increasingly used to assess comparative progress over time. This literature
reports on a broad-base of IP and innovative activity, but risks turning into a statistical horse race. Fourth, the literature
on scholarly theoretical and empirical research and modelling is extensive. This literature often relies on sound
evidence, but tends to use the available information—patent data—without explaining the context in which ﬁrms may
or may not choose to use formal IPRs. It is also rarely accessible to policy makers in the format or timelines required.
None of these frameworks alone are fully capable of providing complete, reliable information about the economic
importance of intellectual property in any one particular country. An approach that positions and integrates various
frameworks, methods and data sources is, therefore, appropriate. The key challenge for the future is to connect
empirical data and micro-economic analyses about ﬁrms’ strategic responses to IP policy changes with statistics and
macro-economic insights on overall economic performance or social welfare.

Introduction

Calling for Evidence-Based IP Policymaking
Governments have long been interested in making IP policy based on sound evidence, but the concept of
evidence-based IP policymaking has recently garnered increased attention. Such attention seems to
correspond generally with a rise in the complexity of IP policy frameworks and the controversies
associated with them.

A number of industry-sponsored studies have made claims about the beneﬁts (or costs) of IP
protection, ostensibly to justify self-interested policy revisions. Other business associations, civil society
groups and academic commentators have responded to such studies with harsh criticism or counterclaims
of their own. There is a large body of scholarly literature addressing the economic impacts of IP, but little
of it is accessible—in theory or practice—to policy makers. Governments have, therefore, struggled to
implement an evidence-based approach to IP policymaking.

One notable catalyst for action towards this ideal was the “Hargreaves report”, a high-level enquiry
into IP’s effectiveness commissioned in 2010 by the UK Prime Minister (Hargreaves, 2011). The report’s
ﬁrst recommendation concerned evidence: “Government should ensure that development of the IP System

is driven as far as possible by objective evidence” (Hargreaves, 2011, pp. 8, 20, 98). This recommendation
was subsequently implemented by the UK Intellectual Property Ofﬁce (2013), which issued a “Guide to
Evidence for Policy”. The Guide explicitly aspires to solicit evidence that meets three criteria: “that it be
clear, veriﬁable and able to be peer-reviewed” (p. 1).

The United States has also undertaken efforts to promote evidence-based IP policymaking. When
Congress passed legislation known as the PRO-IP Act, the US Government Accountability Ofﬁce (US
GAO) was directed to provide information on one particular IP issue: quantifying the impacts of
counterfeit and pirated goods.1 After careful study, the US GAO (2010) reported that “despite
signiﬁcant efforts, it is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to quantify the net effect of counterfeiting and piracy
on the economy as a whole” (p. 27). Indeed, on examination, the US Government could not substantiate
its widely cited estimates of the economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy problems. The PRO-IP
Act also mandated the ofﬁce of an Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) to develop
strategic policy. In doing so, the “IP Czar”, as she was colloquially known, began with a public call for
data and ways to measure IP infringement threats, promoted on the White House blog (Espinel, 2010,
pp. 66–8).

Policy makers in Australia, Canada and at international organizations including the EPO and WIPO
are also feeling the impetus for better evidence to shape IP policy (Global Advantage, 2014). Writing after
the UK Government accepted Hargreaves’s recommendation for evidence-based policy, one IP policy
maker (formerly the economic advisor to the UK IPO, now Chief Economist for IP Australia) summed up
the problem and ideal solution like this:

[W]e are constrained to consider all submissions of evidence to a debate, and that usually
includes a large swath of ‘grey literature’ which can take weeks to get through, leaving very
little time to go looking for academic papers which may be relevant to the policy questions at
hand. . . . For us, the Nirvana would be to have academics, industry, consumer groups and
policy makers sitting in the same room, agreeing on what the underlying data looks like
(Mitra-Kahn, 2011).

Take Canada as one example. There, the Conference Board of Canada’s reports have been among
the most widely publicized studies of Canada’s innovation performance. In 2010, the Conference
Board gave the country a “D” grade (i.e. 14th out of 16 countries). A quarter of that grade was
weighted on a quantitative count of Canada’s IP outputs. For example, indicators included “patents
by population” and “trademarks by population” (Conference Board of Canada, 2010). In 2013, the
Board repeated the study and doubled its indicators. Canada remained 13th out of 16th countries. In
that study, a ﬁfth of the indicators measure quantitative IP outputs; and in each of these, Canada
received a D (Conference Board of Canada, 2013a). The report expressly acknowledges the limits, for
example, of counting patents as a measure of innovation. However, it then asserts these outputs “help
indicate relative national innovative abilities and capacities” (Conference Board of Canada, 2013b).
The Conference Board’s 2015 update compares not only Canada and 15 peer countries, but also
innovation at the sub-federal level in Canada’s 10 provinces and 3 territories. Internationally,
Canada’s ranking increased to a “C”, or 9th out of 16 countries (Conference Board of Canada, 2015).
The new report reduced the number of indicators by half and included only one measuring IP output:
patents by population. Did Canada actually become more innovative? Or did new metrics yield new
results?

The core challenge is similar in various jurisdictions around the world. There is a need to make
intellectual property policy which responds to veriﬁable interests and concerns amongst stakeholders
(Arif and Abbes, 2013). But how?

Evidence-Based Intellectual Property Policymaking

Scope and Methods
This article aims to improve understanding of how IP contributes to the economic performance of a
country’s innovative sectors. The purpose of this study is not to assess the contribution of IP to innovation
or the economy. It is to help policy makers and researchers understand how such assessments have been or
could be done.

Following this introduction, a detailed literature review identiﬁes existing methodologies and
analytical frameworks. I examine relevant research and analysis that relates to the question of how IP
contributes to the performance of an economy across sectors. I adopt an integrative approach, combining
collections of seminal and recent works from across disciplines including economics, management
science, technology and innovation, science policy and law. This article is the ﬁrst of its kind to review and
synthesize what we know across not only sectors and disciplines, but also domains of intellectual property,
that is copyrights, trademarks, patents and related ﬁelds, and to connect those insights with our knowledge
of innovation policy more generally.

To do so, I use a range of accepted literature review methods, including especially citation searching
and bibliographic tracing (Hart, 2001; Machi and McEvoy, 2009; Fink, 2010). This method—which
involves searching forward and/or backward from already known sources—was most appropriate to
ensure coverage not only of key scholarly materials, but also policy-relevant grey literature from
commissioned experts, think tanks, and inter-governmental organizations. Although I did not use
interviews, focus group workshops or open consultations in my research, many of the studies that I review
did use such methods to gather insights about evidence-based IP policymaking.

As a result, my meta-analysis identiﬁes, synthesizes and analyses the most relevant materials;
including peer reviewed and policy-oriented national and international sources across a range of
disciplines in all major ﬁelds of IP. I organize the existing methodologies and frameworks into four major
themes:
 Data for advocacy, used primarily by special-interest lobby groups;
 valuations of aggregate economic contributions of IP-related industries;
 innovation indices, rankings, and policy reports and
 scholarly theoretical and empirical research and modelling.

I then provide an integrated summary of the frameworks, methodologies, data sources and
advantages/disadvantages of each of these approaches. I conclude that none alone are fully capable of
providing complete, reliable information about the economic importance of intellectual property in any
one particular country and explain why. An approach that positions and integrates various frameworks,
methods and data sources is, therefore, appropriate.

Based on my analysis of the literature, and identiﬁcation of its gaps and deﬁciencies, I identify a
potential solution to the challenges of assessing the economic impacts of IP. I explore the usefulness
of an innovation process framework as a practical means to structure the analysis of the socio-
economic implications of IP policy decisions for speciﬁc sectors and across the economy. The
framework explains how ﬁrms’ intellectual property management decisions at the microeconomic
level are affected by IP policy decisions, and how ﬁrm level decisions relate to broader outcomes at
the level of a particular industry or innovation system. Most importantly, this framework may help to
shift the focus of policymaking from a ﬁrm-centric micro-economic perspective to a systemic macro-
economic analysis. This is the crucial leap that few if any studies in the existing IP impact
assessment literature have made. Such a framework could allow policy makers to investigate how the
impacts of their decisions are likely to propagate through the economy, and who the winners and
losers will be.

Literature Review

What Is Reliable Evidence?
Before delving into the dominant frameworks, methods and data sources for assessing the impacts of
intellectual property, it is worth exploring the concept of reliable evidence in this area.

In late 2012, a group of renowned copyright scholars met to discuss the question: What Constitutes
Evidence for Copyright Policy (Kretschmer and Towse, 2013). This symposium was a direct response to
Hargreaves’ report and its subsequent reception by the UK Government. Contributors were asked to start
with their disciplinary perspective on the meaning of the UK IPO’s standards for evidence that is “clear,
veriﬁable and able to be peer reviewed”. Various participants noted different attitudes toward evidence.
For example:
 Economists favour testing hypotheses against objectively selected quantitative data;
 social scientists would also consider relevant norms and power structures and
 governments prefer participatory ways to interpret and weigh all kinds of information, (p. 10).

The contrasting perspectives of economists and lawyers are noteworthy. It has been suggested that the
demand for evidence as understood by economists is especially difﬁcult for lawyers, whose understanding
of evidence is based on interpretation of cases and judgments about what works in their experience rather
than on statistical data (Towse, 2013, p. 1189). I submit that the legal analytical approach is a judgmental
exercise that considers both relevance and probative value in determining whether evidence is acceptable
or not and, if so, what weight it should be given. While lawyers tend to base decisions on facts or analogies,
economists are more comfortable with assumptions and models.

It is clear that economists, lawyers, political scientists and others have differing disciplinary norms
and perspectives on what constitutes reliable evidence, and this is relevant to policy makers who have to
respond to and consult with all of these different groups. Yet one point well-accepted across most
disciplines concerns the recognition of qualitative data. Ethnographic studies based on close observation
can certainly be valid evidence, while anecdotal evidence can be illustrative even if it is not generalizable.
Kretschmer and Towse (2013), conveners of the symposium mentioned above and editors of the published
proceedings, noted the inevitable tension between speciﬁcity and generality (p. 10).

Experts have also confronted the pragmatic aspects of an evidence-based policymaking agenda. Good
quality evidence may in practice be very difﬁcult or impossible to obtain. For one thing, governments have
short time frames that are not always amenable to rigorous scholarly standards. Commissioning research
favours professional consultancies over academic investigators; therefore, there are likely to be biases in
the data and evidence presented to policy makers. Organized and well-ﬁnanced industry lobbyists are
advantaged over disparate small business or consumers (Kretschmer and Towse, 2013, p. 11).

Another issue is that those who insist on evidence-based IP policy occasionally ignore their own
ideals. “Policy making remains a political business with or without economic evidence”, Towse (2013)
explains in the Cambridge Journal of Economics in 2013 (p. 1188). This undermines stakeholders’
conﬁdence in a process of preparing and submitting evidence that may not matter anyways. Database
protection in the European Union (EU) has been cited as one example (Hargreaves, 2011, p. 19). Copyright
term extension for sound recordings in the United Kingdom, to match protection in the EU, is another
(Hargreaves, 2011; Towse, 2013).

In 2006, the Institute for Information Law at the University of Amsterdam reported to the European
Commission on the arguments in favour of several copyright reforms, including extending copyright terms
for makers of sound recordings (Helberger et al., 2008). The report ﬁnds little beneﬁt to term extension.
Subsequent studies in Canada and New Zealand also show little evidence to support extending copyright

terms for sound recordings, because a longer term was unlikely to make any signiﬁcant positive impact
(Hollander, 2005; New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2015). In fact, the New Zealand report
suggests that longer terms would lead to more money leaving the country, as most of its copyright
protected music is imported rather than created domestically (New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
2015, pp. 1, 14). Nonetheless, international proposals like the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership would impose
longer terms falsely promising economic beneﬁts for all member states.

Such challenges make it appropriate to examine more closely various frameworks and methodologies
for IP impact assessments, including their scope and data sources. Reviewing previous studies will help to
demonstrate concerns, identify gaps and propose solutions. The next section of this article clusters existing
approaches into four archetypes: (1) data for advocacy; (2) industry contributions; (3) indexes and
rankings and (4) empirical analyses. While some studies straddle the boundaries between categories, my
original taxonomy helps capture the essence of the various approaches currently available to assess the
economic contributions of IP.

Existing Frameworks, Methodologies and Data Sources
Data for Advocacy
Some of the interest in reliable IP impact assessments and evidence-based IP policymaking is a response to
a growing number of studies prepared or paid for by industry associations or lobbyists. “Data for
advocacy” is one term that has been used to describe these statistics (Towse, 2013, p. 1190). Hargreaves
(2011) was more direct in his report to the UK Government, calling the approach “lobbynomics,” (p. 18).
Rob Reid (2012), in a satirical TED Talk called “The $8 Billion iPod”, reviewed some popular
statistics about the harms of copyright infringement.2 He cited ﬁgures used by the Motion Picture Industry
of America (MPAA) in its press release supporting the Stop Online Piracy Act:
 $58 billion lost to the US economy annually;
 373,000 lost American jobs;
 $16 billion in lost employee earnings and
 $3 billion in federal, state and local governments’ tax revenue (Motion Picture Association of America,
2011).

These ﬁgures are found in a widely cited report from the Institute for Policy Innovation (Siwek,
2007a). The 2007 report on “the true cost of copyright industry piracy”, authored by Stephen Siwek (2006,
2007b), is one of a suite of similar works, also dealing speciﬁcally with sound recordings and motion
pictures.

Another report presents estimates of losses due to piracy in the EU: s240 billion and 1.2 million jobs
by 2015; that statistic is according to a TERA Consultants (2010) report commissioned by the International
Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC) initiative, “Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy
(BASCAP)”. On examination, the methods and data underlying the study were found to be highly
problematic. One government policy maker described how TERA, on behalf of the International Chamber
of Commerce, used “the classic tricks of the trade” (Mitra-Kahn, 2011, p. 84).

The general criticisms are that such reports are not peer reviewed, do not disclose sources or provide
transparent data. More speciﬁcally, the methods used in the TERA study, and others like it, have been
criticized for:
 relying on unveriﬁable data;
 making unspeciﬁed calculations and assumptions;
 double-counting important ﬁgures;

154

 explicitly but arbitrarily adjusting others;
 including formulaic or computational errors;
 and so on (Mitra-Kahn, 2011).

Two further methodological problems concern assumptions about estimated substitution effects (i.e.
whether one infringement equals one lost sale), and blindness to countervailing beneﬁts (i.e. how money
not spent on a CD is nevertheless spent elsewhere in the economy) (Karaganis, 2011, p. 13).

Both studies just cited are examples of impact assessments involving estimates of the costs of not
protecting IP. The implied corollary is that these costs would be avoided with more IP protection. A related
strain of reports couches a similar argument in positive terms, arguing more directly that IP protection
“beneﬁts the economy”, “promotes innovation”, “helps ﬁrms monetize their innovations and grow”,
“helps small and medium enterprises” and “beneﬁts consumers and society”.

A report sponsored by the ICC and BASCAP, titled “Intellectual Property: Powerhouse for Innovation
and Economic Growth”, mentions these virtues (Dixon, 2011). That report expands the analysis to make
claims about the importance of not just copyright industries but also “patent-intensive” industries like
pharmaceuticals, chemicals, aerospace, motor vehicles and electrical engineering, as well as “branded
good” industries relying on trademarks (p. 4). In doing so, it footnotes two earlier works that have been
difﬁcult to obtain for veriﬁcation, and several reports that are no longer accessible as cited (Raymond,
1996; Silberston, 1987).3

Siwek (2014), who reported the $58 billion ﬁgure for the Institute for Policy Innovation, is also noted
for his authorship or co-authorship of numerous periodic reports about copyright industries in the US
economy. The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), a private sector coalition of trade
associations representing US copyright-based industries, commissioned 15 such reports as of 2013. The
2014 version asserts that the copyright industries in 2013 contributed $1.9 trillion (11.44%) to the US
economy and employed 11.2 million workers (8.26% of all US employment).

The IPI, ICC/BASCAP and IIPA work are just a few examples of a large body of grey literature about

IP industry contributions to GDP and jobs.

In response, “user” industry associations have adopted the same methods to support their own
interests. A series of studies funded by the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA)
looks at “The Economic Contribution of Industries Relying on Fair Use” (Rogers and Szamosszegi, 2007,
2010; Rogers et al., 2011). One study includes claims like: “[f]air-use industry value added in 2008 and
2009 averaged $2.4 trillion” and “[e]mployment in industries beneﬁting from fair use and related
limitations and exceptions increased from 16.9 million in 2002 to 17.7 million in 2008” (Rogers et al.,
2011, pp. 6–7). The CCIA also funded a study of industries relying on exceptions and limitations to
copyright in the EU, attributing to these industries s1.1 trillion or 9.3% of GDP and nearly 9 million jobs in
2007 (Akker et al., 2010). A methodologically similar study in Australia, funded by the Australian Digital
Alliance, concludes that in 2010, all the industries relying on limitations and exceptions to copyright
contributed 14% to Australia’s GDP, or $182 billion, and employed 2.4 million people, which is 21% of
Australia’s paid workforce (Houghton and Gruen, 2012a,b).

Many of the industries cited by proponents of more IP protection as being “IP-intensive” or
“copyright-based” are the same industries other advocates cite to support more limitations and exceptions.
One academic has critiqued the latter group of studies, but in fact most of these studies suffer from the same
conceptual difﬁculty. They provide interesting data about industrial contributions, but make unjustiﬁed
assumptions and inferences about the relevance of IP (Barker, 2012).

Mitra-Kahn (2011) aptly explains why the grey literature of industry and government reports set the
tone of debate (at least in copyright policy), despite empirical shortcomings. The reason is not because this
work is inherently better than academic studies, “but because it is presented in a deﬁnite voice,

accompanied by press statements, glossy front-pages and a concerted effort to send short executive
summaries to politicians and policy makers” (p. 77). He notes the “particular trick of telling the reader how
big the copyright industry is”, which is a “rhetorical device” used before moving on to make a case (p. 77).

“IP-Industry” Contributions
Reports stating the cost of IP infringement or the contribution of IP industries to GDP or jobs often come
from industry groups, especially the IIPA, ICC or think tanks like the IPI. But many national governments
and inﬂuential international organizations have also used these methods.

A report from the Economics and Statistics Administration and United States Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce (USPTO) quantiﬁed the importance of “IP-intensive industries” (Antonipalli and Lee, 2016). This
2016 report updated the statistics from the USPTO’s 2012 report on the same topic (USPTO, 2012).
Covering patents, copyrights and trademarks, the Administration and USPTO concluded that “IP-
intensive industries directly accounted for 27.9 million jobs in 2014, up 0.8 million from 2010,”
(Antonipalli and Lee, 2016, p. ii). These industries also “indirectly supported 17.6 million more supply
chain jobs throughout the economy,” creating a total of “45.5 million jobs, about 30 percent of all
employment,” that the report attributes to them (p. ii). Further, according to the report, “IP-intensive
industries accounted for $6.6 trillion in value added in 2014, up more than $1.5 trillion (30 percent) from
$5.06 trillion in 2010,” (p. ii).

In 2013, the European Patent Ofﬁce (EPO, 2013) and the Ofﬁce for Harmonization in the Internal
Market (OHIM) produced their own study: “Intellectual property rights intensive industries: contribution
to economic performance and employment in the European Union”. Because it was expressly intended to
provide results comparable to the US economy, the methodology is closely related to the “pioneering
study” by the USPTO. The headline conclusion is that “IPR-intensive industries contribute 26% of
employment and 39% of GDP in the EU” (p. 6).

The USPTO’s numbers may seem overstated to some readers. That is because they involve a subtle
sleight of hand. Certain “industries” may indeed make gigantic contributions to employment or economic
output. It is misleading, however, to label these “IP-intensive” industries. Such industries do use the IP
system more than other industries. The methodology is generally robust to determine which industries
those are.

But, in fact, we have little idea how IP is used within many of these industries, relative to other
management strategies or policy levers. We know almost nothing about what would happen to these
industries without IP. And what we do know about the impact of IP within these industries is not based on
studies of this kind, but on methodologically different studies. Moreover, while the term “intensive” implies
that IP is used a lot, one of two industries that hardly use IP at all can be more intensive than the other.

Basically, the fact that some industries are important does not support the proposition that IP is
important, or any inferences about how important IP is. That does not mean IP is unimportant. It simply
means that studies like the USPTO’s do not answer questions about the economic impacts of IP.

Citing or, worse, conducting ﬂawed studies presents a credibility concern for those that seek reliable
evidence to inform policy. As noted, the US GAO’s (2010) audit of the government’s assertions about
counterfeiting and piracy showed that ﬁgures coming from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) “cannot be substantiated or
traced back to an underlying data source or methodology” (p.18). Despite internal instructions to stop citing
the debunked numbers, they continue to be referenced by various industry and government sources (p.19).
The methodological caveats apply also to studies about the size of speciﬁc industries perceived but not
proven to be associated with IP. The United Kingdom Department of Media, Culture and Sport’s (2011)
reporting of economic estimates about “creative industries” is an example. Towse (2013) laments that now
such “ﬁgures on the size and growth of the creative industries are monotonously repeated as the motivation

for every enquiry into the efﬁcacy of copyright in the United Kingdom, as though they provided evidence
of its economic incentive value” (p. 1192).

Numerous international organizations also conduct and promote such studies. One illustration is a
report by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Development
Program (2008), which assessed the signiﬁcance of “the creative economy”. The report contains reliable
data, sound methods and interesting ﬁndings about creative/cultural industries in general. The empirical
contribution of its only chapter on intellectual property is derived from the work of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO).

WIPO has been instrumental in dozens of country-level studies of the economic contributions of
copyright-intensive industries. Its Guide on Surveying the Economic Contribution of the Copyright-Based
Industries has become a gold standard for governments seeking numbers that may justify certain policy-
making initiatives in this sector (WIPO, 2003). Its methodology is essentially based on the earlier lobbying
work of the IIPA. But the techniques and standards were subsequently reﬁned by an international group of
well-respected experts, giving this approach the credibility it previously lacked.

The methodology characterizes various industries as “core”, “interdependent”, “partial” or “non-
dedicated support”, and then makes “copyright factor” weighted calculations of economic value added
accordingly. According to WIPO’s guide, for example, core copyright industries include press and
literature; music and theatre; motion picture and video and so on. Software and databases are a signiﬁcant
inclusion in this category, given the often very large economic contribution of this category. Computers
and equipment are an example of an “interdependent” copyright-based industry, since their “function is
wholly or primarily to facilitate the creation, production or use of works. “Paper” is an industry “partial[ly]
interdependent” on copyright, while “furniture” is merely a “partial” copyright industry. “General trade
and wholesaling”, “general transportation” and “telephony and internet” are examples of “non-dedicated
support” industries.

The guide establishes laudable standards for data collection, survey tools, and analytical techniques.
Methodologically, the more serious concern is conceptual. Studies using this method may indeed yield
useful data about many important industries. But it is a big leap to call these “copyright-based” industries,
implying that copyright is the basis for these industries’ success. Why, for example, are “advertising
services” a “core” copyright-based industry, with 100% of their value based on copyright? The “radio and
television” industries do indeed disseminate copyright-protected content, but are as much users as
producers of this copyright. Companies in these industries, just like “computers and equipment”,
frequently argue against copyright protection, not for it.

The methodology underpinning WIPO’s guidelines and similar studies sidesteps this point. The
WIPO Guide does purport to avoid topics like, “the economic impact of copyright law itself, measuring the
social effects of copyright, the valuation of copyright assets of enterprises or the assessment of the effects
of copyright piracy” (p. 7). Unfortunately, this crucial disclaimer is almost never the headline, nor even
part of the summary presented to busy readers and high-level decision makers. Instead, an express aim of
such studies is to facilitate “a new level of awareness of the economic signiﬁcance of copyright protection”
[emphasis added] (p. 7).

Due partly to WIPO’s resources, prestige and inﬂuence, and partly to a lack of viable methodological
options, WIPO’s guide has been implemented in 46 national studies as of 2014.4 It is probably the most
widely used and politically inﬂuential economic impact assessment method that exists.

Take its inﬂuence in Canada as an example. A WIPO-guided 2004 study of Canada’s “copyright-
based” industries reported a total economic contribution in 2002 of $53 billion, 5.4% of GDP, and 900,000
employees (Wall Communications, 2004). Another study, stemming from an Industry-Canada-sponsored
conference in 2001, calculated the contribution of Canada’s copyright sector slightly differently (Putnam,
2006). Before the WIPO guide had been published, Charles, McDougall and Tran used the classiﬁcation of

different kinds of works protected by the Copyright Act to ascertain “principal” and “peripheral” copyright
industries. They then concluded that the GDP of the copyright sector reached $65.9 billion in 2000, or
nearly 7.4% of Canada’s GDP (Charles et al., 2006, chapter 2, p. 26). Using the same concept but a slightly
different method (due to the availability of better data), they also found that the patent sector represents
more than 17% of the Canadian GDP, or over $130 billion (chapter 2, p. 49). In 2000, according to this
study, the gross domestic production of the trademark sector amounted to $313.5 billion, or 35.35% of total
value added in Canada (chapter 2, p. 43).

As interesting as all these ﬁgures are, they simply beg the question of how exactly copyrights, patents
or trademarks contribute to the economic outcomes of putatively associated industries. Calling something
an “IP-intensive” or “copyright-based” or “branded good” industry, or a “patent sector” or “trademark
sector” implies that its economic contributions are attributable to IP. None of these studies, however,
empirically support that proposition.

Innovation Indices and Rankings
The series of 46 WIPO-guided studies of contributions by copyright-based industries are indicative
of a trend in IP impact assessment work globally. For many policy makers, it is not enough to
believe that IP contributes billions or trillions to GDP. Governments want
to know how they
compare to other countries. Several methods are commonly used for international indices, rankings
and comparisons.

An aim of the WIPO (2003) guidelines was to establish a basis for comparison of future surveys built
on reliable data and common methodologies (p. 7). Its 2014 analysis of the numerous national studies
demonstrates success in achieving this goal. While WIPO’s comparative analysis still cannot shed light on
whether or how copyright actually impacts the “copyright-based” industries or the economy generally, it
does contain interesting observations about relationships between copyright-based industries and other
measures of policy success. WIPO analyzed how the contributions of copyright-based industries to GDP
and jobs in various countries correlate to rankings in innovation, competitiveness, government
effectiveness and freedom from corruption. Strong positive correlations (though not causal relationships)
were found in each case (WIPO, 2014a).

The “Global Innovation Index”,

the “Global Intellectual Property Index”, and the “Global
Competitiveness Index” are some of the international ranking systems most relevant to IP policymaking.
Each includes several IP-related indicators among a broad range of other variables, and each collects data
using multiple reliable methods.

So far, nine editions of the Global Innovation Index have been produced since 2007.5 The 2016 report,
titled “Winning with Global Innovation”, was co-published by WIPO, INSEAD and Cornell University
(Dutta et al., 2016). Five “input pillars” of the index capture elements of the national economy that enable
innovative activities: (1) institutions; (2) human capital and research; (3) infrastructure; (4) market
sophistication; and (5) business sophistication. Two “output pillars” capture actual evidence of innovation
outputs: (1) knowledge and technology outputs; and (2) creative outputs. Sub-pillars are composed of
individual indicators, which lead to weighted averages and scores to produce sub-indices and, ultimately,
the overall index on which countries are ranked, (p. 14).

The 2016 index includes 82 indicators, about 10% of which are based upon IP-related data (indicators

were given half-weight):

(Dutta et al., 2016, pp. 401–6)

The other indicators cover data on matters ranging from regulatory environments, to educational
achievements, to ICT infrastructure, to available ﬁnancing and many more. To their great credit, the
indexers have also integrated cutting-edge measures of creative output,
including domain name
registrations, Wikipedia edits, and YouTube video uploads, (Dutta et al., 2016, p. 406). These new
indicators supplement and dilute the impact of older studies that emphasized IP outputs as the most (or
only) relevant indicator of innovation.

These and other creative industry output ﬁgures used in the index—such as cultural and creative
services exports as a percent of total trade; national feature ﬁlms per million of population; and global
entertainment and media output per thousand of population—are not “IP-related” indicators per se. But the
index’s authors appropriately make no claims, inferences or assumptions about whether or how IP
inﬂuences the ﬁgures. The methodology of the Global Innovation Index stands in contrast, therefore, to the
IP-industry contribution studies described above.

The “Global Intellectual Property Index 5” (GIPI5), released in 2016, compares the cost-efﬁciency of
IP regimes—including patents, trademarks, copyrights, design, and data protection—for fourty-three
“important jurisdictions” (TaylorWessing LLP, 2016, p. 2). GIPI5 asserts that “IP is now less blatantly a
tool of rich nations to oppress poorer nations,” and cite the growing number of IP litigation in China as an
example that “having an effective and credible IP regime is increasingly recognised as a stimulus for
home-grown innovation and investment,” (p. 5). These assertions give little context about the impact of IP
on the economies studied, and what it means to be an “important jurisdiction”.

Nevertheless, the GIPI5 is refreshing because none of its indicators quantify IPRs in assessing the
quality of an IP regime. Perhaps for that reason, its results contrast with other innovation-related indices.
Consider Canada’s success on the GIPI5, for example: Canada ranked 4th overall, 10th in Trademarks, 7th
in Patents, 3rd in Copyrights, 8th in Design, and 14th in Data Protection (Taylor Wessling, 2016, p. 8;
compare Conference Board of Canada, 2010, 2013a, 2015a). Meanwhile, the United States ranked 24th
overall, 15th in Trademarks, 11th in Patents, 17th in Copyrights, 42nd in Design, and 10th in Data
Protection. Even the GIPI5 authors note the irony that the U.S. still lists Canada in its Special 301 Report
Watchlist, “as the US government considers that [Canada] has not yet gone far enough in addressing the
problems of piracy and counterfeit goods,” (p. 54). Overall, while GIPI5’s cost-efﬁciency scores offer a
unique perspective on the quality of an IP regime, shufﬂing around the traditional top contenders, it also
requires the reader to accept at face value that IP regimes have a positive impact on a country’s economy
(p. 2).

The Global Competitiveness Index covers 12 pillars, many of which are similar to the components of
the Global Innovation Index: (1) institutions; (2) infrastructure; (3) macroeconomic environment; (4)
health and primary education; (5) higher education; (6) goods market efﬁciency; (7) labour market
efﬁciency;
(11) business
sophistication; and (12) innovation (Schwab and Sala-i-Martın, 2016, pp. 39–40). Statistical data for
these pillars are obtained from internationally recognized agencies.

Evidence-Based Intellectual Property Policymaking

In this context the Global Competitive Index relies on a number of IP-related indicators. Speciﬁcally,
“intellectual property protection” counts for half of the weighting for “property rights”, which is 20% of
the value of “public institutions”, which itself is 75% of the “institutions” pillar, which is 25% of the “basic
requirements”, which ranges from 20–60% of the total index score. IP protection and Patent Cooperation
Treaty applications are two of the eight indicators that count for 50% of the score for the 12th pillar, “R&D
innovation”, which is 50% of “innovation and sophistication factors”, which is 5–30% of the overall score
(Schwab and Sala-i-Martın, 2016, pp. 39–40). As one can see, the indexing formula is complex.

Notably, this index also uses data from the World Economic Forum’s annual “executive opinion
survey”, (Schwab and Sala-i-Martın, 2016, pp. 77–88). More than 14,000 “business leaders” were
surveyed in 20 different languages. National-level partner institutes carried out the surveys. Guidelines
speciﬁed the method of, ﬁrst, listing potential executives from both small- and medium-sized enterprises
and large companies; second, stratifying the pool based on size and sector and choosing a random sample
from the pool to survey. Surveys are administered in a variety of formats, including face-to-face or
telephone interviews with business executives, mailed paper forms and online surveys. The data collected
are then edited, aggregated and analysed. The World Economic Forum has audited and aimed to improve
its survey methods and analytical techniques on a regular basis. Nonetheless, the GCI’s indicators still
suffer from outdated notions, such as quantifying intellectual property rights as a proxy for innovation,
(Schwab and Sala-i-Martın, 2016, pp. 39–40). In the 2016 report, however, the authors propose to update
the 12th pillar with indicators measuring collaborative forms of innovation (p. 74–5). Collaboration-
centric, rather than IP-centric, indicators are a promising shift that other indices should follow;
nevertheless, these changes are still forthcoming in the next GCI report.
Of particular interest from the GCI indicators is the question pertaining to intellectual property
protection: “In your country, to what extent is intellectual property protected? [1 ¼ not at all; 7¼ to a
great extent].” One fundamental problem with this question, from a methodological standpoint, is that
different respondents may interpret the meaning of “the extent” of protection differently. While many
respondents might believe that a great extent of protection means more protection, some respondents
may understand that a great extent of protection means more appropriate protection, that is a healthier
IP system.

Some industry associations have attempted to use “strong” IP as the only indicator in a scorecard or
ranking system, which is essentially a self-interested appraisal of various countries’ policy environments.
An example is a February 2015 study by the Global Intellectual Property Center (GIPC, 2015a,b), funded
by the US Chamber of Commerce, dramatically titled UP: Unlimited Potential. This is the third iteration in
a series designed to promote stronger IP protections for the special interest groups who fund the work.
Methodological criticisms include arbitrarily selecting or scoring indicators, disproportionately weighting
pharmaceutical patents, making questionable correlations without conﬁdence intervals,
imposing
subjective judgments about the law, encouraging baseless rhetoric and more (Basheer, 2015; Barooah,
2014; Chawla, 2015). The report, for example, criticizes Canada’s patent system as weak due to allegations
that Canada’s utility standard is out-of-line with international norms, an allegation Canada strongly
disputes.6 Other countries are criticized for protecting public health and safety, like enacting plain-
packaging requirements for tobacco. More generally, the report rests on faulty premises derived from the
authors’ (or funders’) subjective normative assessments of other countries’ legal frameworks. It fails to
meet the most basic standards of transparency or veriﬁability.

By ranking countries based on certain indicators, these reports are methodologically somewhat
similar to the large-scale indices from WIPO or the World Economic Forum. But they lack the robustness
or reliability of those other studies. Some are also conceptually contradictory. A study by the Business
Software Alliance (BSA, 2013), for example, purports to assess various aspects of the strength of IP
protection as a measure to determine whether a country satisfactorily supports cloud computing. But many

of the computer and communications business actually involved in cloud computing are vocal advocates
for less strict IP laws (see, for example, Rogers et al., 2011).

Although methodologically distinct,

the large-scale international ranking reports (the Global
Innovation Index and the Global Competitiveness Index) are useful because they recognize that IP is one
among many factors that inﬂuence innovation and competitiveness. While increasing the number of IP
outputs can have an impact on a country’s ranking, these studies do not claim that IP causes innovation, let
alone that IP is responsible for broader economic outcomes. Despite the sophistication of the international
indexing studies, however, some organizations and commentators misinterpret the implications or
misapply the methods. Policy makers cannot use them to determine whether IP protection is important or
not, how important IP protection might be, or what might be the impact of any particular change to IP
policy. These studies assume and assert, but do not establish, that IP is one of many factors that inﬂuences
innovation and competitiveness.

Empirical Analyses
In contrast to the glossy reports and succinct summaries offered by special-interest groups, there is a vast
body of comparatively technical but empirically rigorous scholarly literature that sheds light on the
economic impacts of intellectual property. A full review of this literature is beyond the scope of this study,
but a general overview of common frameworks and methodologies is warranted.

Figure 1 depicts a linear analytical framework that implicitly underpins many studies in this area:
patents are used as an indicator of intellectual property rights, although other rights are also considered
occasionally; intellectual property rights and/or surveys are used as indicators of innovation and
innovation or intellectual property rights are assumed to be proxies for/indicators of/correlated with
economic outcomes. In other words, intellectual property is sometimes used as one of the key indicators or
components of innovation, which is (accurately) presumed to be economically beneﬁcial. Intellectual
property is other times analysed in more direct relation to economic outcomes, such as growth, trade or
investment.

This framework for studying intellectual property, innovation and economic outcomes maps roughly
onto the linear model of innovation itself, which depicts a process moving from basic research, to applied
research, to development, to diffusion. A linear model is attractive because it is amenable to statistical
analysis, which partly explains its popularity and longevity (Godin, 2006). Such an approach can
sometimes be useful, but also has numerous shortcomings that a synthesis of the relevant literature reveals.

Intellectual Property and Innovation
Researchers use many different metrics to measure innovation, including intellectual property statistics.
Patent statistics dominate in the context of innovation, science and technology, and research and
development. The history of patent data as an indicator of innovation, research and development and

technological change is rooted in the seminal work of Jacob Schmookler (1966), and explained well in
several literature reviews conducted over the past 30 years (Basberg, 1987; Griliches, 1990, 1998;
Griliches et al., 1986). This literature should be considered in the context of seminal research on
innovation generally (see, for example, Schumpeter, 1934, 1942; Nelson and Winter, 1977; Edquist, 1997;
Jaffe et al., 2005; Lundvall, 2010).

One reason patent statistics are often relied upon is that patents were the most closely aligned with new
technologies. While it remains true that copyrights are most closely associated with cultural industries, and
trademarks with branding and goodwill, businesses in fact rely on all kinds of intellectual property rights to
protect innovations of different sorts. A growing body of empirical research provides evidence regarding
commonly used appropriation mechanisms, which range from formal patents to informal secrets and other
mechanisms like product complexity (de Beer et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2014). The use of formal
appropriation mechanisms such as patents is, by far, not the norm. That is especially true in developing
countries, but also in developed countries (see, for example, de Beer et al., 2014a,b, pp. 5–6; Ncube et al.,
2014). Lead-time over competitors and customer sales/service activities are more important appropriation
mechanisms. Among ﬁrms that consider IP important, trademarks are considered most important, on
average, followed by trade secrets, copyright, industrial designs and lastly patents (Jankowski, 2012).
Also, many innovative ﬁrms and individual users adopt open innovation strategies that intentionally
eschew patent protection (de Beer, 2015). This reality undermines studies that treat patents as the only, or
even most important, intellectual property right relevant to innovation.

Another reason patent statistics dominate innovation discourse is because they are among the richest
and most readily available sources of information. “In this desert of data, patent statistics loom up as a
mirage of wonderful plentitude and objectivity” (Griliches, 1990, p. 1661). Patents also present a unique
opportunity for longitudinal analysis, given the availability of data over many decades. Despite these
advantages, there are drawbacks. Many innovations are not patented. And many patents never lead to
innovation. In short, patent data presents an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of innovation,
as Figure 2 demonstrates. Patents are only available for novel, useful and non-obvious inventions.
According to the most widely accepted deﬁnition from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) and the Statistical Ofﬁce of the European Communities (Eurostat), however, an
“innovation” can be new to the world, new to a country, or new to a ﬁrm (OECD and Eurostat, 2005, p. 46).
Moreover, patents only protect certain kinds of technical subject matter, while innovations might occur
across a broad range of business functions. The existence of a patent does not indicate whether an invention
is radical, minor or irrelevant. It is also very difﬁcult to attribute value to any particular patent, as opposed
to aggregated portfolios of patents.

These inherent limitations make it risky to rely on patents as indicators of innovation. Nevertheless,
doing so is common. For example, a Canadian report published by the C.D. Howe Institute purported to
measure “domestically applied innovation” with patents (Brydon et al., 2014). The authors claimed the
methodological innovation of using patents to shed light on “not only the inputs of the innovation process,
such as research and development spending, but the outputs applied in Canada” (p. 1). This approach
misunderstands the relationship between inventions and innovations. Patented inventions are typically an
outcome of the research process but an input into the innovation process. The authors do acknowledge the
limitations of patent data, but nevertheless base conclusions and headlines about regional innovation on
that data alone. Such studies would be more useful if focused more narrowly on patenting trends. It is
interesting that the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors have a low share of Canadian inventors
applying for patents in the Canadian market; but the relevance of that fact for innovation policymaking is
unclear, and the economic implications even less so.

That does not mean patent data should be ignored. The oft-cited conclusion about using patents to
measure innovation is this insight ﬁrst stated 50 years ago: “We have a choice of using patent data

cautiously and learning what we can from them, or not using them and learning nothing about what they
alone can teach us” (Schmookler, 1966).

The shortcomings of patent data as indicators of innovation contributed to the development of
another technique: innovation surveys. In fact, some of the evidence of problems with reliance on
patent data was collected using such surveys (Cohen et al., 2000; Levin et al., 1987). While there was
sporadic data collection by some governments before the 1980s, innovation surveys did not become
systemic until the 1990s (Godin, 2002). In the ﬁeld of innovation, guidelines developed by the OECD
and Eurostat (2005)—published in the Oslo Manual—are now the international standard for survey
work. Various national governments, including the United States and Canada, also collect data on
business innovation using surveys tailored to particular purposes (Boroush, 2010; Government of
Canada, 2009a; Statistics Canada, 2014). Some of these surveys focus speciﬁcally on intellectual
property management, which is useful to better understand the behaviour of particular ﬁrms (Statistics
Canada, 2012). Such surveys do not assume that patents indicate innovation; instead, they provide
insights into why and how ﬁrms that innovate use the intellectual property system (Baldwin, 1997;
Baldwin et al., 2000; Baldwin and Hanel, 2003). The major drawback of this method is expense.
While patent data are produced consistently and available readily on a rolling basis, surveys are by
their nature complex and periodic undertakings. We learn what we can from them when data are
available.

Scholars have explained how both patent data and innovation surveys can be used in tandem to shed
light on innovation, or more speciﬁcally technological change (Archibugi and Pianta, 1996). Numerous

challenges remain, however, which the existing literature on intellectual property and innovation has not
yet solved, such as assessing:
 innovation with data on intellectual property rights other than patents;
 industry/economy-wide impacts of ﬁrms’ intellectual property strategies and
 macro-economic outcomes linked to particular intellectual property policy changes.

Intellectual Property and Economic Outcomes
The Ginarte-Park (GP) index is the most widely cited measure of patent protection by cross-country
economic analyses of intellectual property and economic outcomes. It was introduced in an article by
Ginarte and Park (1997) and updated in Park’s (2008b) subsequent work. It measures select aspects of the
strength of countries’ patent legislation in ﬁve-year intervals between 1960 and 2005. Similar indexes
were developed to measure copyright and trademark protection (Park and Lippoldt, 2005; Reynolds,
2003). These indexes are widely used for modelling relationships among intellectual property and
innovation, R&D, GDP, trade, investment, technology transfer and other variables.

In theory, the exclusive rights protected by intellectual property are predominantly justiﬁed as an
incentive to invest in innovation through research, development and commercialization of new products
and processes. The basic economic premise, well explained in the literature, is that without the guarantee
of exclusivity that intellectual property provides, the world would have less creativity and fewer inventions
(see, for example, Dosi et al., 1988; Gallini and Scotchmer, 2002; Greenhalgh and Rogers, 2010b; Landes
and Posner, 2003; Scotchmer, 2004; Collete, 2012). The promise of even temporary market exclusivity
should motivate ﬁrms to invest in the inherently uncertain activity of innovation.

Empirical evidence proving this theory in practice, however, is scarce. Economist Keith Maskus (2012)
offers one of the most important, must-read reviews of econometric analyses of intellectual property’s
impact on innovation and/or technology transfer. It is not possible within the scope of this article to fully
detail the vast body of literature on this topic (Greenhalgh and Dixon, 2002; Hall and Harhoff, 2012). But
Maskus summarizes it well: “There are no clear and universal relationships”, he explains, “between policy
reforms to strengthen IPRs and subsequent innovation or R&D investments” (p. 63).

While intellectual property can and does stimulate activity in advanced markets, especially by
multinational ﬁrms, patent law reforms have little if any impact on domestic innovation in poor countries.
Also, even in developed countries, almost every economic study Maskus reviews fails to resolve the
reverse causality problem: patent reforms could increase R&D and innovation, or innovative countries
might simply introduce more patent reforms (See also Fink and Maskus, 2005; Gault, 2010).

Evidence also suggests that intellectual property is more important to large ﬁrms in industries such as
pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. In the semiconductor industry, large ﬁrms use intellectual property
rights more to cross-license portfolios and defensively preserve freedom to operate than to incent or recoup
R&D investments, while smaller ﬁrms use intellectual property mainly to signal commercialization
potential to venture capitalists (Hall and Ziedonis, 2001). A global statistical and economic policy analysis
by WIPO (2011) explains how economists have reﬁned their view of IP systems, especially the patent
system, to pay greater attention to cumulative innovation and collaboration as opposed to market
exclusivity (see Scotchmer, 1991; Bessen and Maski, 2009). Open innovation is causing scholars,
businesses and policy makers to rethink many of the fundamental assumptions, management strategies and
framework policies around intellectual property (de Beer, 2015).

In theory, intellectual property protection also leads to technology transfer, by reducing the threat of
imitation in other countries, increasing the availability of technical information and facilitating cross-
border licensing transactions. Studies reviewed by Maskus show that patent reforms have positive effects

164

on inward technology transfer, attract foreign patents and expand the activities of multinationals through
local sales, investment, R&D and licensing. These effects, however, are generally only found in large and
middle-income countries, not the smallest and poorest countries. Moreover, Maskus (2012) cautions, these
international activities may threaten local ﬁrms or undermine learning from abroad through nonmarket
channels; meaning that international technology transfer may not increase overall welfare. Overall, however,
“available economic evidence supports the claim that transparent and enforced IPRs facilitate international
transactions in technology, at least among emerging-market countries. In turn, this enhanced access to
global information materially contributes to domestic structural transformation and industrial growth in
countries with conducive complementary economic and regulatory conditions” (Park and Lippoldt, 2008).
A series of works by Christian Handke (2010, 2011, 2012) contains authoritative literature reviews on
the economic evidence pertaining speciﬁcally to copyrights, as opposed to patents. A literature review and
plea for more empirical evidence by Png (2006) is also very useful.

A summary of Handke’s (2012) review is worth quoting fully: “There is initial evidence, for example,
that the economic effects of digital copying vary between different industries, but these differences are not
yet well understood. Most importantly, the empirical literature is unbalanced. The bulk of econometric
research has focused on unauthorized copying and rights holder revenues. Little is known about the
implications for user welfare, for the supply of copyright works, or about the costs of running a copyright
system” (p. 47).

Towse similarly summarizes the empirical copyright literature: “Basically, empirical research has
covered three areas: measuring losses from unauthorised use of copyright works (piracy), the contribution
to national economies of copyright-based industries (reviewed earlier) and studies of creators’ earnings
from copyright works” (p. 1195). It is the last category where Towse notes we know the least. She observes
that there are only indirect data about the incentive function of copyright, which is what Handke
characterizes as the supply of copyright works. Moreover, Towse explains “what data there are strongly
suggest that the industries, not the initial content creators (authors), beneﬁt from copyright law” (p. 1195).

General Equilibrium Modelling
A number of studies have investigated the impact of innovation on economies using dynamic equilibrium
modelling. Such models use economic data to estimate how an economy might react to changes in policy,
technology or other external factors. They consist of equations describing the interactions among model
variables and economic data presented as input–output tables. The equations tend to be neo-classical with
assumptions about demand, labour mobility, competitive behaviour and price adjustments.7

Heer and Maußne (2005) emphasize the popularity and reliability of this method in their introductory
the two authors note, “dynamic general
textbook to general equilibrium modelling. Speciﬁcally,
equilibrium models have become the workhorses of modern macroeconomics” (p. V). Such models allow
researchers to conceptualize, and as a result answer questions about, complex, constantly evolving modern
economies over periods of time. The strength and value of dynamic general equilibrium modelling is
further illustrated by the breadth of economic questions it can be used to answer. Heer and Maußne (2005)
suggest that the themes of these questions are generally grouped into three primary categories: those
relating to the transitional dynamics of economies; those that seek to understand how economies react to
“supply and demand shocks”; and those concerned with “heterogeneous-agent economies” (p. V).

Some general equilibrium model studies illustrate the economic and public policy implications of new
technologies. For example, Australian economists have developed the MONASH model. A dynamic
general equilibrium model, MONASH can be applied to inform public policy in several ways, including:
“estimating changes in tastes and technology . . .; explaining periods of economic history in terms of
driving factors such as policy changes, changes in world commodity prices, and changes in tastes of
technology . . .; generating forecasts for industrial, occupational and regional variables . . . and calculating

the deviations from explicit forecast paths for macro and micro variables which would be caused by the
implementation of proposed policy changes” (Dixon and Rimmer, 2001, p. 37).

Similarly, Acemoglu et al. (2012) developed and applied a general equilibrium model in a study of
new, innovative technologies and the standardization periods that often follow their introduction. That
study yielded several potentially valuable insights for policy makers, such as: the idea that innovation-
standardization cycles can be “an engine of economic growth, [or] . . . act as a barrier to growth by
potentially slowing down innovation”, and the prediction that “data on product and process innovation
might be used to test the existence of a trade-off between innovation and standardization at an industry
level” (p. 593). Jin (2012) has also developed and applied a general equilibrium model to better understand
how domestically produced technologies have helped China combat climate change. He concluded that
China has made signiﬁcant advancements; however, further innovation and environment speciﬁc policies
are required (p. 640). Leao (2003) fashioned a general equilibrium model that analyzes how the adoption of
new technologies, referred to as ‘technology shocks’, may affect the US banking sector.

Other authors have used general equilibrium models to show that the effects of IP policy differ with
the size of a country’s economy. Shifting focus from patents to copyright, a doctoral thesis by Cheng
(2004) examined the economic effects of extending copyright terms in developing countries with a general
equilibrium model. Chu et al. (2012) also utilized a general equilibrium model in their study of IP and
innovation in the US market. They concluded in this study, “patent protection has asymmetric effects on
different types of innovation that carry different chances of patent infringements, and hence, the traditional
tradeoff of optimal patent protection needs to be modiﬁed to take into account these asymmetric effects of
patent policy” (p. 742).

Through the construction of general equilibrium model, Helpman (1993) has also reached
conclusions about IP protections, innovation and economic growth. Chief amongst his conclusions is
the ﬁnding that relaxed IP frameworks might beneﬁt the global South, and in some cases may even
beneﬁt the North (p. 1274–1275). Building on the work of Helpman, several other scholars have
constructed dynamic models to study the effect of IP rights on economic growth and innovation
(Azevedo et al., 2014; Bye et al., 2009; Shao, 2014). Indeed, numerous academics have indicated how
dynamic models of IP rights and market structures might affect competition policymaking (Greenhalgh
and Rogers, 2010a). Finally, Pathak et al. (2013) have partially relied on data from a general
equilibrium model in their evaluation of how IP rights and foreign direct investment inﬂuence
technological entrepreneurship (p. 2095).

The construction of economic models is a complex process in which researchers must recognize and
include the factors that will ensure a model is appropriate and applicable to a speciﬁc context, so that it can
answer speciﬁc questions. For instance, to properly analyze the relationship of IP and innovation in the
Global North and South, Helpman included assumptions about wage rates and labour productivity in both
regions, and assumptions about the broad availability of imitated products in the Global South (Helpman,
1993, p. 1252–53).

While these studies have developed a broad range of models, each of which can be used to address
speciﬁc policy questions, the economic relationship of IP and innovation remains far from being entirely
understood. As Gans (2011) notes: “it is hoped that future research will be able to further untangle . . . the
role of intellectual property protection in providing a separate instrument to stimulate innovation” (p. 73).
Consequently, further studies, based on new, advanced dynamic systems models are likely needed if this
ﬁeld is to continue to yield valuable policy insights.

Institutional Challenges
Prior to presenting discussion and conclusions that might be drawn from the literature reviewed above,
there is one further point worth mentioning. It is that evidence-based policymaking is difﬁcult in

institutions without solid systems in place for tracking, sharing and integrating knowledge acquired over
time. The Canadian experience is illustrative in this respect.

Several studies rely upon reports and indices to lament Canada’s ostensibly poor performance in the
area of innovation. But such studies and reports fail to really grapple with the existing evidence empirical
impact of IP in this context, or if they are rejecting (as opposed to neglecting) existing evidence, to propose
methods or metrics for studying the matter. For instance, an inﬂuential report on mobilizing science and
technology in Canada identiﬁed IP as a major issue for attracting venture and intellectual capital, but failed
to explain how (Government of Canada, 2007). Ten years later, little has been done. In a progress report
after 2 years, the only mention of IP was the bare fact that Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)
investments resulted in 1,750 rights (Government of Canada, 2009b). The next year, a government strategy
paper at least acknowledged the disruptive trend toward open innovation and IP sharing, but failed to
integrate the concepts into its proposals (Science Technology and Innovation Council, 2011). The Council
of Canadian Academies’ Expert Panel on Business Innovation in Canada (2009) issued an extensive and
well-researched report on Canadian innovation, but offered only general remarks on the impact of IP, not
methodological guidance or empirical priorities. Similarly, the high-proﬁle Jenkins panel, which was a
“call to action” on innovation in Canada, could only conclude about IP: “the government needs to explore
this issue further” (Jenkins et al., 2011). Think tanks have echoed the plea for serious studies on this topic
(Mazurkewich, 2011). While counting IP outputs is convenient (Corbin, 2010), good research and
policymaking requires a radically new approach to studying these issues as more than a “statistical
horserace” (Hawkins, 2012).

Yet, numerous speciﬁc impact assessment studies have been done. Take the context of copyright
law reform. These include studies by respected academics and consultants on topics ranging from
possible new performers’ and producers’ rights (Towse, 2003), to the impact of WIPO’s internet
treaties (Boyer, 2003), to changes to the private copying system (Hirshhorn, 2005), to economic effects
of copyright reform on service providers (Chwelos, 2006), technology-enhanced learning (Hirshhorn,
2011), and select users and consumers (Hollander, 2005). There are also, in Canada, industry-sponsored
or academic analyses of proposed legislative changes in other ﬁelds, which unlike most “data for
advocacy” reports, do present transparent methods, veriﬁable data and peer-reviewed ﬁndings. The
impact of extended data protection terms on the pharmaceutical industry is one example (Grootendorst
and Hollis, 2011).

The most relevant characteristic of these studies by Canadian government-commissioned or industry-
sponsored researchers is their speciﬁty of analysis. They do not purport to make broad claims about the size
of IP industries, or cherry-pick statistics to support polemics. The narrower the study, the more likely it
seems to provide evidence that relies on transparent methodologies, veriﬁable data and peer reviewable
conclusions. Yet, its own studies are not often cited when Canada makes purportedly justiﬁed changes in
its IP policies. As in the United Kingdom and EU cases mentioned at the outset of this article, Canada is not
alone with this pattern of behaviour.

Discussion and Conclusions

Each of the four frameworks described above is arguably useful to some extent, although each also has
fundamental limitations in the context of broad questions about IP’s economic contributions. Table 1
summarizes the methodologies, data sources and limitations of each of these existing frameworks.

Even data for advocacy has the beneﬁt of being accessible to policy makers, though the ease of access
to reports that are not transparent, veriﬁable or peer reviewed is also part of the problem in this area. At
least, however, such reports have increased the scrutiny to which putative evidence is held and driven the
demand for more reliable studies.

Assessments of the contributions of IP-industries have the advantages of transparent, consistent
methodologies and robust, reliable data sources. These studies also provide an opportunity for
internationally comparative analyses. Their main drawback is the tendency for busy readers to
believe or infer from headlines that the studies actually provide evidence of the relationship between
IP and IP-related industries. They do not. The size of so-called “copyright industries”, for example,
says nothing about the economic impacts of copyright in general or any particular legal or policy
reform.

Several global indices and ranking systems are based on sound methodologies and reliable data,
despite the inevitable challenge of selecting appropriate indicators on which to base an analysis. The

best of these studies include a large number of relevant indicators that reﬂect, for example, inputs to
and outputs from the innovation process. The disadvantage is that as the indicators become more
diverse and the analysis becomes more nuanced, the implications for IP policy become less clear.
There is also a risk that innovation policymaking more broadly might devolve into a statistical horse
race rather than an informed investigation. Having more IP outputs may increase a country’s
ranking but, as both theory and evidence clearly show, more IP does not mean more innovation and
could, in fact, lead to less.

A large body of scholarly literature from multiple disciplines contains theoretical insights and
empirical evidence about the importance of IP for innovation and/or other economic outcomes. Much of
the literature developed over recent decades relies on patent data, because it is available, detailed,
longitudinal and comparable. Unfortunately, patent data are also incomplete and potentially misleading.
We know for a fact (via innovation surveys and other approaches) that except in speciﬁc industries patents
are not a widely popular appropriation strategy. More generally, open innovation is requiring us to rethink
both research methods and policy approaches. There are few if any studies to inform policy based on
statistical analyses of ﬁrms’ uses of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or IP rights other than patents.
The patent-based studies that do exist are also highly contextual, with results depending on the dynamics of
the particular innovation, ﬁrm, industry, country or region in question.

It is impossible to generalize, based on methodologies and data in existing industry reports,
government studies, academic scholarship or any other literature, about the economic importance of IP.
None alone is fully capable of transparently, veriﬁably and rigorously answering the core policy questions:
what is the importance of IP to the economy, and what is the evidence of IP’s impact?

The existing methodologies and frameworks demonstrate that intellectual property is one of many
factors which inﬂuence the inner-workings of an economy on a macro (market-level) or micro (ﬁrm-level)
scale. Intellectual property, through its rights and regimes, seeps into many market forces and ﬁrm
activities; therefore, one must study the issue with a mind to the factors acting on it as much as its impact on
the economy, market, industry or ﬁrm. Intellectual property rights give innovators a monopoly over their
creation, allowing the appropriation of a larger amount of resources from exploration to exploitation; but it
also reduces spillovers by creating costs for other ﬁrms to use existing ideas. Changes to an intellectual
property regime, therefore, will affect not only how a ﬁrm operates internally, but also how it interacts with
external actors (that is civil society, investors, universities, etc.) on which it depends on. Measuring the
treatment of intellectual property by a country, or conversely, the impact of an IP policy change on a
country’s economy, therefore, requires a systemic approach.

In practical terms, this article asserts that policy makers can better assess the state of intellectual
property and its impacts by situating it within the larger context of economic forces which affect ﬁrm
behaviour. Although a policy question may seem to address a niche IP issue, its ripple effects and
inﬂuences, and therefore stakeholders, will often reach further. The key challenge for the future, therefore,
is to connect empirical data and micro-economic analyses about ﬁrms’ strategic responses to IP policy
changes with statistics and macro-economic insights on overall economic performance or social welfare.

7. General equilibrium economic models are not the same as dynamic systems models. While both approaches are
dynamic (that is consider how process change over time as a result of ﬂows and feedbacks), they are philosophically
very different. General equilibrium models have their origins in neo-classical economics and converge to a steady-
state solution. Dynamic systems models have their origins in engineering systems and may frequently display
chaotic (in the mathematical sense of the word) behaviour with no steady state outcome.
