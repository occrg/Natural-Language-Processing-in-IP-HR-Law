    “A Fracture in Time”: A Cup Attributed 
to the Euaion Painter from the Bothmer 
Collection 
       Christos     Tsirogiannis   *

         Abstract:     In February 2013 Christos Tsirogiannis linked a fragmentary Athenian 
red-figured cup from the collection formed by Dietrich von Bothmer, former 
chairman of Greek and Roman Art at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
to a tondo in the Villa Giulia, Rome. The Rome fragment was attributed to the 
Euaion painter. Bothmer had acquired several fragments attributed to this same 
painter, and some had been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well 
as to the J. Paul Getty Museum. Other fragments from this hand were acquired 
by the San Antonio Museum of Art and the Princeton University Art Museum. 
In January 2012 it was announced that some fragments from the Bothmer 
collection would be returned to Italy, because they fitted vases that had already been 
repatriated from North American collections. The Euaion painter fragments are 
considered against the phenomenon of collecting and donating fractured pots.      

   INTRODUCTION 

 In 2011 New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art (MMA) formerly took possession 
of  some  10,000  fragments  of  Greek  pottery  that  had  formed  part  of  the  personal

collection to Dietrich von Bothmer (1918–2009), chairman of Greek and Roman Art 
at the MMA.  1   These fragments had been acquired throughout his career at the MMA 
(1946–2009), and they formed his own private collection, which was stored in his MMA 
office. The MMA accepted the donation reportedly “with the express approval of the 
Italian Ministry of Culture.”  2   Bothmer is acknowledged as the best student taught by 
Sir  John  Beazley,  Lincoln  Professor  at  Oxford  University,  who  is  universally  recog-
nized as the leading international scholar of ancient Greek pottery.  3   Bothmer had the 
rare skill of identifying fragments of the same vases in different institutions, inheriting 
Beazley’s talent and continuing his tradition. Jody Maxmin noted Bothmer’s skills:  4  

  He was one of the few people who could look at a fragment of a vase and 
realize, by consulting his limitless memory, that it belonged to a vase in 
the Louvre … Then he’d buy it and donate it. The world of vases, for 
him, was an infinite, never-finished jigsaw puzzle.  

  Bothmer was instrumental in mounting an exhibition of the Athenian black-
figured pot-painter known as the Amasis painter, bringing together pots attrib-
uted to this anonymous figure.  5   Five years later the Louvre hosted an exhibition 
of the works attributed to the Athenian red-figured pot-painter Euphronios that 
included the calyx-krater that Bothmer had acquired for the MMA.  6   

 In January 2012 it was announced that 40 fragments from Bothmer’s collection 
would be returned to Italy.  7   Some of these fragments are reported to be from pots 
already returned to Italy from North American collections, though not necessarily 
from the MMA. Little detail was provided about the return.  8   In February 2013 the 
MMA announced the creation of a project to digitize and place online Bothmer’s 
collection of fragments, mostly thus far unpublished. The announcement included 
four random images from the collection, currently stored in shelves at the MMA. 
A short notice was also posted on the website of the Association of Art Museum 
Directors (AAMD) Object Registry in compliance with their policy relating to the 
acquisition  of  antiquities  that  lack  documented  collecting  history  (erroneously 
termed as “provenance”) prior to November 1970.  9   One of the images depicts a 
 kylix  put together from many fragments in a yellow cardboard box. The exterior of 
the  kylix  seems to have been cleaned; the interior, by contrast, appears worn. A few 
fragments are missing, mainly the center of the tondo, leaving a rhomboid-shaped 
space. The tondo was decorated with a satyr and a maenad, both standing, on each 
side of a large vase of an unidentified type. 

 In March 2013, while researching a separate cup via the Beazley Archive data-
base, Christos Tsirogiannis noticed a rhomboid-shaped fragment from an Attic red-
figured cup tondo that resided in the Villa Giulia in Rome.  10   The Rome fragment 
showed  part  of  a  satyr  holding  a   kantharos   over  a  volute-krater,  with  a  maenad 
to the right. Although the find-spot of the fragment was unrecorded, it had been 
given to the museum by Contessa Francesca Parisani Gnoli in 7 September 1913 
(along with eight complete vases). The Rome fragment was attributed to the 
Euaion painter by Sir John Beazley in the 1920s.  11   This Rome fragment fitted the

fragmentary cup residing in the Bothmer collection that had been illustrated on the 
MMA website as an example of the bequest ( Figure 1 ).     

 This raises the issue of how the fragments had entered the Bothmer collection, 
and whether Bothmer could have been expected to appreciate the significance of 
the link with the Villa Giulia fragment. In addition, was the collecting history of 
this fragment typical of the rest of Bothmer’s collection as well as his donations to 
other institutions?   

 BOTHMER AND THE EUAION PAINTER 

 The Euaion painter is recognized as an Athenian pot-painter who was influenced 
by the work of Douris.  12   Martin Robertson described him as “an accomplished 
draughtsman and maintains a high standard of care,” and John Boardman noted 
that he was “a prolific artist of some merit and more nearly Classical in mood.”  13   
Surprisingly, the Bothmer fragmentary cup was not listed on the Beazley Archive 
database as attributed to the Euaion painter. The Beazley Archive lists three frag-
ments in the Bothmer collection:

 oinochoe.  Formerly in the Curtius collection, Rome.  16   [Beazley 209794]   

   
  While two of the fragments were attributed by Beazley, one (a) was perhaps attrib-
uted to the Euaion painter by Bothmer himself.  17   Bothmer appears to have been 
familiar with the work of the Euaion painter. Two of the fragments had formed 
part of the collection created by Ludwig Curtius (1874–1954) of the German 
Archaeological Institute in Rome.  18   Apart from the three listed fragments in his 
collection (a–c), other pieces were donated by him to the MMA and to the J. Paul 
Getty Museum. The MMA has several examples of the painter’s output, including 
several fragments acquired from Bothmer:

joined  a  fragment  that  was  placed  on  loan  to  the  MMA  from  the  Louvre 
Cp 11439.  19   Bothmer gave four further fragments in 1983, acc. no. 1983.186a-
d, and a further fragment in 1989, acc. no. 1989.175.  20   The Louvre fragment 
had been attributed to a follower of Douris.  21

( 1985 ). The fragments joined MMA 1979.517.1 and Louvre Cp 11472.  23   The 
Louvre fragment had been attributed to the Brygos painter.  24    

  i.       Cup fragment. Acc. no. 1986.99.3. Gift of Dietrich von Bothmer (1986). The 

fragment joined Dresden 355.  25     

   
  It should be noted that Bothmer was able to link fragments in his possession to 
those in other collections such as the Louvre and Dresden (f, h, and i). In addition, 
Bothmer was so confident about his attributions that he was able to depart from 
Beazley’s identifications (f and h). One of the Louvre fragments fitted a cup that 
was acquired in fragments between 1973 and 1989 (f). Bothmer commented:

  In the course of the last ten years fragments of a cup appeared on the 
market and were acquired piece by piece. When the cup was nearly com-
pleted it was discovered that a small triangular fragment was in the Louvre. 
This has now been incorporated.  26    

  The identity of the dealer or dealers was not disclosed, and full collecting history 
has not been provided.

  The Bothmer fragments were donated to the Getty without full collecting histories. 
The fragments given by Herbert L. Lucas (k and l) are interesting as Lucas sup-
plied fragments of an Attic red-figured krater attributed to the Berlin painter that 
was returned to Italy.  35   Other fragments of the krater were derived from Bothmer, 
Galerie Nefer, and Robin Symes, and other fragments were reported to be in the 
possession of Giacomo Medici.  

 Other Recently Surfaced Fragments of the Euaion Painter 

 The restored Getty cup derived from the European Art Market (n) included a 
fragment donated by J. Robert Guy. Guy had supplied 15 fragments for an Attic 
red-figured amphora attributed to the Berlin painter and acquired by the MMA.  36   
(Polaroid images from the Medici Dossier show the amphora in the early stages of 
restoration.) Four fragmentary cups attributed to the Euaion painter, and derived 
from Guy’s personal collection, were acquired by the Harvard University Art 
Museum.  37    The  source  or  sources  for  these  fragments  has  not  been  disclosed, 
although Guy claimed that the pieces were derived “from friends and dealers.”  38   Did 
Guy’s fragment come from the same “European Art Market” source as the other 
fragments? If so, what were the circumstances of the acquisition? Guy also attrib-
uted two of the three cup fragments acquired by the San Antonio Museum of Art to 
the Euaion painter, although the date of the attributions is not recorded. All three 
fragments were given by Gilbert M. Denman, Jr.  39   The fragments themselves were 
purchased from the former MMA conservator Peter Sharrer, New York, in 1985.  40   

 470   

 CHRISTOS TSIROGIANNIS AND DAVID W. J. GILL

Sharrer also handled the collection of pot fragments sold by J. Robert Guy. James 
Cuno, then at Harvard, described the acquisition of the Guy fragments by the 
Harvard University Art Museums:  41  

  In  1995,  David  Mitten,  James  C.  Loeb  Professor  of  Classics  and  our 
George M. A. Hanfmann Curator of Ancient Art, encouraged me to visit 
Peter Sharrar [sic.], a New York art dealer, to see the group of vase frag-
ments he had acquired from Robert Guy.  

  These Harvard fragments, described by Cuno as “fractures in time,”  42   form part of the 
opening statements in Cuno’s major contribution to the cultural property debate.  43   
 It  is  perhaps  significant  that  Princeton  University  Art  Museum  acquired  a 
Roman sculpture from Sharrer in 1985, the same year that the Harvard fragments 
were purchased (with funds from Mr. & Mrs. Leon Levy); this piece has subse-
quently been returned to Italy as it has been found near Tivoli in 1981–82.  44   In 
addition one of the pieces remaining in Princeton at the time of the agreement to 
return other antiquities to Italy was a fragment from an Attic red-figured  lekythos  
attributed to the Pan painter (inv. 1998–223).  45   This had been given by Mr. and 
Mrs. Peter Sharrer in honor of Allen Rosenbaum. The  lekythos  is clearly recogniz-
able in the Becchina photographic archive. It was apparently purchased on 26 June 
1993 for 2 million Italian lire. It is unclear how the  lekythos  fragments moved from 
Switzerland to Princeton. What was Sharrer’s role? Can their journey find a parallel 
in other antiquities that he handled? It is important that Princeton releases the full 
information relating to the acquisition. 

 Princeton remains silent over the cup fragment, attributed to the Euaion painter, 
that was acquired by Princeton University Art Museum in 2002.  46   It was given in 
memory of Emily Townsend Vermeule. Requests for information about the col-
lecting history have gone unanswered by James Steward, the Director, and Michael 
Padgett, the Curator of Ancient Art. Yet the AAMD’s  Guidelines on the Acquisition 
of Archaeological Material and Ancient Art  (revised 2013) clearly state (Section G)

  The museum should promptly publish acquisitions of archaeological mate-
rials and ancient art, in electronic form, including an image of the Work 
(or representative images in the case of groups of objects) and its provenance, 
thus making this information readily available to all interested parties.  47    

  It is unclear if the fragment was derived from a private donor or a dealer. It should 
be noted that a black-glossed  askos , acquired in 2002 and given in memory of Emily 
Townsend Vermeule, was returned to Italy in 2011.  48   Among the other pieces given 
in memory of Emily Townsend Vermeule was a gilt silver pierced appliqué plaque 
showing a chariot with a Nike as a charioteer.  49   This plaque seems identical to 
another in a British-based private collection that has been linked to the Koreschnica 
burial near the river Vardar in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which 
also contained a monumental krater now apparently in a New York private collec-
tion.  50   Again, requests for information about the collecting history for this relief 
have gone unanswered by the curatorial staff in the museum.   

FRACTURE IN TIME

 The Formation of the Bothmer Sherd Collection 

 The link between the Villa Giulia tondo fragment and the fragmentary cup in the 
Bothmer collection raises several questions. As Bothmer was not born when the 
central piece of the cup was donated to the Villa Giulia Museum in 1913, how 
did Bothmer acquire the remaining fragments? What was his source or sources? 
What  is  the  full,  accurate,  documented,  and  authenticated  collecting  history 
(or histories) of these Bothmer fragments? Were the pieces found together with the 
central piece or at another time (as was the case for the Attic black-figured François 
vase)?  51   How and when did the Bothmer fragments cross the Atlantic? Tsirogiannis 
contacted the curatorial staff at the MMA (email February 26, 2013) regarding the 
name of the person from whom Bothmer acquired the fragments and the  kylix ’s 
earlier collecting history, but at the time of this writing (some two years later), he 
was still waiting for an answer. Yet the museum had drawn attention to these very 
fragments by posting them on the museum website. 

 It has been established that a proportion of the fragments in Bothmer’s collection 
were acquired from the convicted dealers Gianfranco Becchina  52   and Robin Symes 
(from Symes’s interrogation by the Italian authorities on 28 March 2003), as well 
as from the arrested dealer Edoardo Almagià.  53   Between 1984 and 1993, Bothmer 
donated 119 fragments to the Getty Museum,  54   some of which have recently been 
identified as looted and have been returned to Italy.  55   Dozens of other fragments 
were donated by Bothmer to the MMA, before they, too, were returned to Italy.  56   
Bothmer was a major contributor to the publication of the exhibition catalogue 
 Glories of the Past , which included a considerable part of the Shelby White/Leon 
Levy antiquities collection.  57   Several pieces have been identified as looted and have 
been returned to Italy and Greece.  58   (A fragmentary “Weary Herakles” has been 
returned to Turkey via Boston’s Museum of Fine Art.)  59   Several other high-profile 
antiquities acquired by the MMA during Bothmer’s curatorship were also identified as 
looted and have been repatriated to Italy. These include the famous Euphronios 
krater  60   and the Morgantina treasure.  61   The Lydian hoard has also been returned 
to Turkey.  62   

 Bothmer had a trained and keen eye that could connect fragments held by 
different institutions. Given his apparent interest in the work of the Euaion painter, 
it seems surprising that he would not have linked his fragments with the long-
published and distinctively shaped Villa Giulia fragment. He would have been able 
to reunite the fragments as a whole object. After all he stated his views on fragmen-
tary pots in an interview given in 1997:

  I always gave fragments of mine when they would fit another vase in the 
collection. Or if they fitted vases in other collections and could be used 
as exchange material. I have made 35 exchanges like this with the Louvre 
over the years. I do not consider my own collection of fragments as my 
property, but they are, so to say, in my custody and are left to the Metro-
politan Museum of Art in my will.  63    

 472   

 CHRISTOS TSIROGIANNIS AND DAVID W. J. GILL

  It seems unlikely that Bothmer would have overlooked the association with a fragment 
listed by his supervisor Beazley. And if he overlooked it, what could be the reason? 

 The answer perhaps lies in the secure Italian origin of the Villa Giulia fragment. 
If Bothmer had published the whole  kylix , he would have to explain how an ancient 
vase of Italian origin had surfaced in Bothmer’s New York office in the MMA. If 
the fragments he owned were licit (e.g., from an old named collection), there was 
no reason for them to remain unpublished while in his hands. It seems, then, that 
Bothmer was willing to suppress knowledge of a fine work of art, and its broader 
academic implications, rather than to be publicly involved, once more, in the 
political implications of owning a potentially toxic antiquity, especially after the 
repatriations of other looted and smuggled antiquities to whose acquisition and 
publication he had contributed.  64   

 The  connection  between  the  Villa  Giulia  fragment  and  the  Bothmer  collection 
had been made by Tsirogiannis through a piece of research on a fragmentary 
(and restored) cup attributed to the Euaion painter that had surfaced at Sotheby’s 
(London) in December 1982, and again in July 1989.  65   (It appears as two separate 
entries in the Beazley Archive database: 13718, 51204.) This Sotheby’s cup then 
reappeared at Christie’s New York in December 2012. The cup itself was identified 
from  the  Schinousa  archive,  suggesting  that  it  had  passed  through  the  hands  of 
Robin Symes and Christos Michaelides. 

 The  Sotheby’s  December  1982  sale  is  also  significant  as  it  contained  material 
that has subsequently been returned to Italy. They include a Lucanian nestoris 
attributed to the Amykos painter (lot 298) that appears to have been associated 
with Graham Geddes in Australia and then passed into the collection of Boston’s 
Museum of Fine Arts,  66   and an Attic red-figured amphora attributed to the Berlin 
painter (lot 220) that had been acquired by the MMA, with additional fragments 
supplied by J. Robert Guy.  67   This amphora was recognized from images seized in 
the Geneva Freeport demonstrating its links with Giacomo Medici.  68   In addition, 
a disputed Athenian black-figured amphora, attributed to the painter of Vatican 
365 and showing a departing chariot, passed through the December 1982 sale 
(lot 255) [Beazley 7462]. It is now in Madrid’s Museo Arqueológico Nacional 
(inv. 1999/99/61).  69     

 The Context for the Euaion Painter’s Cup 

 One of the consequences of the looting of archaeological sites is the loss of scien-
tific knowledge about find-spot and associated finds. The distribution of Athenian 
figure-decorated and black-glossed pottery adds to information about economic 
interactions between different parts of the Mediterranean world during the sixth, 
fifth, and fourth centuries  bce . 

 The Beazley Archive lists some 224 pots against the Euaion painter. The majority 
of the find-spots for the pots and fragments attributed to the Euaion painter are 
lost.  Fragments  have  been  found  in  the  Athenian  agora  and  in  the  Kerameikos, 

FRACTURE IN TIME  

  473 

with another fragment at Brauron in Attica. Many of the known find-spots in Italy 
have been found in Etruria (Cerveteri, Chiusi, Gravisca, Nepi, Orvieto, Poggio la 
Croce, Populonia, Veii, Vulci), Campania (Capua, Nola), northern Italy (Bologna). 
and on the Adriatic coast (Adria, Numana). Further fragments have been found in 
southern France (Ensérune, Le Cayla), and in the Crimea (Kerch).    

 FRAGMENTARY POTS IN A WIDER CONTEXT 

 It has been argued by some that these fragmentary pots are peripheral to the loot-
ing of larger works of art. However, it has been observed that many of these frag-
ments have sharp edges, indicating that they are fresh breaks.  70   This has raised the 
possibility that the pots have survived in near intact condition for some 2500 years 
and have then been deliberately broken when they have been removed from their 
previously undisturbed archaeological contexts. 

 It is noteworthy that some of the Athenian pots returned to Italy were restored 
from fragments derived from a number of different sources. The Getty returned 
a fragmentary red-figured krater attributed to the Berlin painter that was derived 
from several individuals, including Herbert Lucas (1977), Vasek Polak (1982), 
Dietrich  von  Bothmer  ( 1984 )  and  Robin  Symes  (1990)  as  well  as  purchased 
from Galerie Nefer owned by Frida Tchacos-Nussberger (“European Art Market”) 
in Switzerland (1984), and Frederick H. Schultz, Jr. (“European [sic] Market”; 
1987).  71   Further fragments are reported to have been offered on loan by Giacomo 
Medici.  72   

 Another  Athenian  red-figured  cup  returned  from  the  J.  Paul  Getty  Museum 
was attributed to Onesimos.  73   The first fragments were derived from Galerie Nefer 
(“European Art Market”) in 1983. A further fragment from the Bothmer collec-
tion was added the following year, and additional material from the Hydra Gallery 
(“European Art Market”) in 1985. Two further fragments of the cup were provided 
to  the  Italian  authorities  by  Giacomo  Medici  in  2005,  and  a  further  fragment 
showing  Talthybios  was  recovered  from  a  private  address  at  Cerveteri  in  2008. 
The Etruscan inscription on the cup suggests that it was found in a sanctuary at 
Cerveteri. 

 Two Getty examples shed light on the way that money could be demanded for 
fragments that could be added to a pot attributed to a well-known “painter.” 
A fragmentary Athenian red-figured phiale attributed to Douris was also returned 
from the Getty.  74   The initial gifts were made by Werner Nussberger (husband of 
Frida Tchacos-Nussberger) in 1981, and additional fragments were sold by Fritz 
Bürki & Sons in 1982, and by the Galerie Nefer in 1985; additional pieces were 
reportedly placed on loan in 1992.  75   Robert Hecht reportedly offered a single frag-
ment for an “outrageous” sum for one of the Getty cups attributed to the Brygos 
painter.  76   

 There was concern that the attribution of fragments to named painters could 
enhance their value for donations to museums.  77   Bothmer is reported to have 

 474   

 CHRISTOS TSIROGIANNIS AND DAVID W. J. GILL

donated some 119 fragments to the Getty between 1981 and 1993, and Watson and 
Todeschini have provided estimates of possible monetary values for the gifts.  78     

 CONCLUSION 

 The Bothmer fragments appear to be linked with the wider movement of archae-
ological material from Mediterranean countries, and specifically Italy, to North 
American private (and public) collections.  79   The connections between fragments 
in different institutions or held by private individuals may indicate how the net-
works behind the market operate. It will be important for the MMA to publish the 
remaining Bothmer fragments as a matter of urgency so that they, too, can be open 
to public scrutiny. The museum also needs to state how Bothmer acquired the frag-
ments, either as gifts, payments in kind or as purchases. The MMA also needs to 
look at the conflict of interest when a curator collects in his or her area of museum 
specialism.  80   The case is also a reminder of how curators in the great encyclopedic 
museums have been central to the acquisition of recently surfaced material.  81   The 
ethical issues are a reminder of the wider questions that have been raised about the 
culture within the MMA in this period.  82   

 On 14 June 2013 (or earlier), the image of the  kylix  was removed from the 
MMA’s  website,  without  any  explanation  from  the  museum.  In  July  the  Italian 
Ministry of Culture announced that the Bothmer fragments would be returned to 
Italy to be reunited with the Villa Giulia tondo. Can further returns (and restora-
tions) be expected as the MMA publishes images of the Bothmer collection? The 
Euaion painter’s cup opens a door on how Attic pot fragments circulated among 
dealers, collectors, and museums.
