on Returning Antiquities

Abstract: The return of 13 classical antiquities from Boston’s Museum of Fine
Arts (MFA) to Italy provides a glimpse into a major museum’s acquisition
patterns from 1971 to 1999. Evidence emerging during the trial of Marion True
and Robert E. Hecht Jr. in Rome is allowing the Italian authorities to identify
antiquities that have been removed from their archaeological contexts by illicit
digging. Key dealers and galleries are identified, and with them other objects
that have followed the same route. The fabrication of old collections to hide
the recent surfacing of antiquities is also explored.

In October 2006 the MFA agreed to return to Italy a series of 13 antiquities (Ap-
pendix). These included Attic, Apulian, and Lucanian pottery as well as a Roman
portrait of Sabina and a Roman relief fragment.1 This return is forming a pattern
as other museums in North America are invited to deaccession antiquities that are
claimed to have been illegally removed from Italy. The evidence that the pieces
were acquired in a less than transparent way is beginning to emerge. For example,
a Polaroid photograph of the portrait of Sabina (Appendix no. 1) was seized in
the raid on the warehousing facility of Giacomo Medici in the Geneva Freeport.2
Polaroids of two Apulian pots, an amphora (no. 9) and a loutrophoros (no. 11),
were also seized.3 As other photographic and documentary evidence emerges dur-
ing the ongoing legal case against Marion True and Robert E. Hecht Jr. in Rome,
it is likely that the Italian government will step up its requests for the return of
objects that were removed from Italy. However, the initial batch of objects from

Boston gives cause to reflect on the collecting patterns that have allowed unprov-
enanced, or perhaps even falsely provenanced, objects to enter the collections of
distinguished museums.

RETURNING ANTIQUITIES FROM MALIBU AND NEW YORK

The Boston return is part of a wider pattern and follows a number of recent cases
of deaccessioning. In February 1999 the J. Paul Getty Museum returned to Italy an
Attic red-figured cup signed by Euphronios as potter and attributed to Onesimos.4
The cup was acquired in fragments between 1983 and 1985. Underneath the foot
was an incised dedicatory inscription showing that the cup had been dedicated to
Ercle (Herakles).5 Although one of us earlier commented, “We may not know from
which Etruscan site these sherds were collected, or even the name of the tombaro-
lo,”6 the cup almost certainly was found in a sanctuary of Ercle at Cerveteri, which
was not excavated until 1993.7 It is now known that different fragments of the cup
passed through different sources before arriving at the Getty: the tondo passed
through the Galerie Nefer in Zurich and was said by Frida Tchacos-Nussberger to
have originated with Nino Savoca in Munich.8 Other fragments passed through
the Hydra Gallery and were attributed to the Zbinden collection, a designation
closely linked to the movement of illicit antiquities in Switzerland.9 Other pieces
were attributed to the S. Schweitzer collection of Arlesheim. However, the clinching
piece of evidence was that photographs of the piece were found in the raid on Med-
ici’s warehousing facilities in the Geneva Freeport.

In 2005 it was agreed that the Getty would return the Asteas krater, which was
made in Paestum in southern Italy and acquired by the Getty in 1981.10 The piece
was apparently been sold by Gianfranco Becchina of Basel; and photographs were
reportedly found in 1995 in the wrecked car of Pasquale Camera, a figure closely
linked to the illicit antiquities market in southern Italy.11 The Asteas krater was
returned to Italy with two other antiquities in November 2005. It is reported that
some 55 pieces at the Getty are directly linked to Medici or Hecht, presumably
identified in part by the appearance of photographic evidence seized during raids
in Geneva.12 These returns are likely to be the first in an extended run of requests,
but requests will not be from Italy alone. In July 2006 the J. Paul Getty Museum
agreed to return a Boeotian funerary relief of Athanias to Greece; in September
2006 it went on display in the National Museum in Athens.13

Antiquities are also returning to Italy from New York. In February 2006 the
Metropolitan Museum of Art signed an agreement to return a number of antiq-
uities, including the Euphronios krater and the hoard of silver thought to come
from Morgantina.14 The silver hoard was acquired in 1981 and 1982 with the claim
that “this group of fifteen objects, presumably found together a generation ago,
represents some of the finest Hellenistic silver known from Magna Graecia.”15 It
has been reported that the hoard passed through Switzerland before being sold to

the Metropolitan for $3 million by Hecht.16 Among the batch of antiquities to
return are an Attic red-figured psykter attributed by Robert Guy to Smikros,17 an
Attic red-figured amphora attributed to the Berlin painter that surfaced in Sothe-
by’s in London,18 and an Apulian dinos.19

THE BOSTON ANTIQUITIES: DATES OF SURFACING

AND THE MYTH OF OLD COLLECTIONS

The deaccessioned Boston antiquities do not form a homogeneous group. They
were acquired from a number of different sources between 1971 and 1999 (Fig-
ure 1). In November 2005 the MFA deputy director, Katherine Getchell, was un-
convinced by Italy’s request; she is quoted as saying, “There’s absolutely nothing
we’ve seen or heard that proves anything to us.”20 Yet less than a year later, the
evidence must have been so compelling to allow the museum to speed through
the request for the return.21

It is striking that some material was claimed to have been in old collections and
thus known for some years or even decades before acquisition. The earliest of the
13 objects to be accessioned by the MFA was a Lucanian nestoris (no. 12) ac-
quired in 1971 from Leo Mildenberg; it was reportedly acquired in 1962, on a
Bank Leu invoice of January 21, 1971, from the R. Peirere Collection, Madrid.
This in itself is significant because 1971 falls before the declared benchmark of
December 30, 1973, set by the Archaeological Institute of America in its resolution
on the importation of antiquities.22 This deadline recognized the damage inflicted
on the archaeological record and sought to restrict the publication for any object
that surfaced for the first time after this date. Was the evidence that this nestoris

Arts, Boston.

314

DAVID GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE

was removed from Italy illegally so compelling? Was this evidence of the Spanish
collection fabricated to support the sale? Did this dealer, Leo Mildenberg, supply
other museums with equally fabricated histories? It also questions whether objects
acquired before December 30, 1973, should be returned. Should the cutoff be placed
at 1960 or even earlier?

Other deaccessioned objects are claimed to have been in old collections which
predate December 30, 1973. For example, an Attic red-figured pelike (no. 7) was
purportedly in the Swiss private collection of Mr. Karl Haug in Basel since 1936;
during the 1970s it passed through Palladion Antike Kunst in Basel. Is it signifi-
cant that the Attic red-figure amphora now in the Getty, but which also passed
through Palladion Antike Kunst, was documented as being in the British Rycroft
collection in 1890, yet was shown in a Polaroid from Medici’s warehouse still coated
with dirt?23 Is this claim as reliable as the one made for the Getty kouros, which
was allegedly “in the collection of Dr. Jean Lauffenburger of Geneva since the
1930s”?24 If the MFA pelike was indeed known in the 1930s, why was the MFA so
willing to return it? Was this claim unreliable or even fabricated?

An Attic black-figured lekythos (no. 4) was ostensibly found at Selinus on Sicily
in the 1960s. It was reportedly acquired from the French numismatist Hubert
Herzfelder, who worked in Sicily from the 1930s. The naming of such a collection
normally would not have drawn attention and could seem plausible, but it is un-
likely correct given the return of the lekythos to Italy. A second piece in the MFA,
an Apulian bell-krater, was also said to have come from this source via the Hecht
route.25 Apart from these three pieces, all other MFA items surfaced and were ac-
quired after the 1973 watershed and were therefore subject to suspicion.

Other MFA pieces from old collections include the portrait of Sabina (no. 1)
(Figure 2), which was claimed to have come from “an aristocratic family collec-
tion in Bavaria” which has the ring of the anonymous histories so often seen in
sale catalogs “Property of a Gentleman.” Given that the piece appears in the Med-
ici Polaroid archive, this history for Sabina is demonstrably false. Finally, the Apulian
bell-krater (no. 10) was noted by A. D. Trendall and A. Cambitoglou as formerly
residing in the Holger Termer collection in Hamburg.26 The Termer designation
may be little more than stock that passed through the Galerie Neuendorf in Ham-
burg in 1980 (Table 1).27 The prompt return of these pieces to Italy suggests that
some of these old collections have either been fabricated or are little more than a
front for objects passing through the market to give them a hint of respectability.

THE DEALERS, GALLERIES, AND AUCTION HOUSES

The MFA pieces come from a number of different dealers and galleries. Two of
the objects passed through Atlantis Antiquities of New York owned jointly by Rob-
ert Hecht and Jonathan Rosen.28 An Apulian amphora (no. 9) previously passed
through the hands of Fritz Bürki & Son of Zurich (1991); but A. D. Trendall and

A. Cambitoglou referred to it in the possession of Atlantis Antiquities, New York.29
Bürki was associated with two further pieces in Boston (Table 2): an Attic red-
figured hydria attributed to the Berlin painter and purchased on January 11, 1978
(no. 6), and the portrait of Sabina (no. 1) acquired on November 14, 1979, with
Hecht acting as the agent (Figure 3). Hecht allegedly purchased an Attic black-
figured lekythos (no. 4), purportedly acquired at Selinus in the 1960s, before sell-
ing it to the MFA through Atlantis Antiquities. During police raids in 2001, Bürki
reportedly admitted that he was a front for Hecht;30 one of his roles was to con-
serve and restore antiquities before they were shipped from Switzerland. One of
their more important collaborations was the restoration of the Euphronios krater
before it was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.31

This link between Atlantis Antiquities and Bürki has also emerged from inves-
tigations at the Getty concerning a pair of Etruscan antiquities, a tripod and a
candelabrum, revealing a close relationship between Giacomo Medici, Bürki, and
Atlantis Antiquities.32 Indeed, it appears that Medici was the seller (and acknowl-
edged as such by Marion True of the Getty); but the antiquities were consigned
for shipment by Bürki, and then transferred, once in North America, to Atlantis

Antiquities. A similar Medici–Bürki–Hecht–Atlantis Antiquities route can also be
followed for an Apulian pelike showing Andromeda and attributed to the Darius
painter and acquired by the Getty in 1987.33 Medici–Hecht–Atlantis Antiquities
apparently proposed a sale of 20 Attic red-figured plates to the Getty in 1987.34
Another of the Swiss dealers and galleries through which Boston acquired an-
tiquities was Palladion Antike Kunst of Basel. Pieces from this source include an

time, allegedly came from Taranto (Table 3); no other pieces had a history before
surfacing in the sale. Other material from this sale includes an Attic black-figured

Art,37 an Attic red-figured oinochoe fragment also in San Antonio,38 an Attic red-
figured pelike in Bochum,39 and an Attic red-figured cup in Kurashiki Ninagawa
Museum in Japan.40 Palladion Antike Kunst, subsequently trading as Palladion An-
cient and Fine Art AG of Basel, was run by Ursula ‘Rosie’ Becchina, the German
wife of Gianfranco Becchina.41 Becchina appears to be a rival of Medici, who also
supplied Hecht with antiquities.42

Two MFA pieces passed through Auktion 51 Münzen und Medaillen in Basel
(but one was subsequently acquired by Fritz Bürki) in March 1975 (nos. 6 and
8). This gallery was run by Herbert A. Cahn, who was convicted of handling
antiquities in Italy in 1976.43 Although the present location of many of the pieces
from this sale is unknown, two of the lots are now in the Reiss-Museum in
Mannheim.44

A Lucanian nestoris (no. 12, see previous text) was sold to the MFA by Leo
Mildenberg through Bank Leu of Zurich. Although he did possess a personal col-
lection of antiquities relating to animals in ancient art, the MFA piece was pur-
chased against a Bank Leu inventory. Does this bring into question the history of
other pieces acquired through Mildenberg?45 This collector is known for possess-
ing the other half of a terra-cotta antefix, which appears to come from a sanctuary
at San Biagio in southern Italy.46

There is a London connection to the MFA pieces. Bruce McAlpine purchased
the Attic black-figured hydria (no. 3) from Palladion Antike Kunst before selling
it to Boston. McAlpine was also selling Greek pottery to other museums at ex-
actly this time.47 The role of Sotheby’s in London was also significant.48 A Luca-
nian nestoris (no. 13) surfaced for the first time in the auction on December
13–14, 1982, lot 298 (Figure 4).49 It was then on loan to the Borchardt Library at
La Trobe University (1988–1994), the university closely associated with A. Dale
Trendall, one of the great authorities on South Italian pottery; the lender was
Graham Geddes of Melbourne.50 Geddes runs Graham Geddes Antiques and An-
tiquities of Armadale, Victoria, Australia, and is currently an approved valuer of
Greek and South Italian pottery for the Australian Government’s cultural gifts
program.51 Sources for the Attic pottery in what is termed as the Geddes collec-
tion (but it is unclear if this is stock from the gallery) include Münzen und Me-
daillen in Basel52 and Sotheby’s London.53 Pots loaned or formerly in his collection
appear in several Australian and New Zealand collections: the Classics and Ar-
chaeology Collection, University of Melbourne;54 the Antiquities Museum, Uni-
versity of Queensland;55 the James Logie Memorial Collection, University of
Canterbury, Auckland, New Zealand.56 Other Attic and South Italian pots from
the Geddes collection were on display in the Borchardt Library at La Trobe Uni-
versity in 2006.57 Egyptian antiquities from the collection have been loaned to
Monash University and appeared in the exhibition “From the Sands of the Sahara:
Ancient Kellis and its Texts” (1998). Moreover, a set of antiquities entitled “The
Graham Geddes Collection” was sold at Christie’s (Melbourne) on October 15,
1996.58

One MFA piece that surfaced in Sotheby’s was an Apulian loutrophoros (no. 11),
which was sold on December 10, 1984, lot 366. This was sold one year before the
meeting between Peter Watson and Brian Cook of the British Museum when they
discussed the growing number of Apulian pots appearing on the London mar-
ket.59 Indeed, R. J. Elia has suggested that around 30% of the previously unknown
Apulian pots surfaced through Sotheby’s from 1980 to 1992.60 Subsequent revela-
tions have shown that many of the pots in the period between December 1983
and December 1986 were consigned by Serge Vilbert or Christian Boursaud ac-
counting for some 248 objects worth £640,880.61 The most recently acquired of
the deaccessioned MFA objects, an Attic bell-krater (no. 5), surfaced through Sothe-
by’s in London on December 14, 1995, lot 95.

In New York two of the Apulian pieces, the bell-krater (no. 10) and the loutro-
phoros (no. 11), were sold by the Royal-Athena Galleries owned by Jerome Eisen-

REFLECTIONS ON RETURNING ANTIQUITIES

berg. Eisenberg draws attention through his gallery web site to the fact that the
MFA was a good client.62 Eisenberg is a member of the International Association
of Dealers in Ancient Art (IADAA).63 One code of conduct for members of the
IADAA is, “The members of the IADAA undertake not to purchase or sell objects
until they have established to the best of their ability that such objects were not
stolen from excavations, architectural monuments, public institutions or private
property.” In spite of this, there seems to have been sufficient evidence to convince
MFA trustees to return to Italy two pieces sold by Royal-Athena Galleries. Eisen-
berg has deflected criticism by suggesting in a September 2006 interview with the
Boston Globe, “None of these are monumental works of art, and what fuss are
[Italian audiences] going to make about this vase? . . . Far more people will see it
at the MFA.”64 Yet, simultaneously Eisenberg was featured in the History Lost ex-
hibition at the Benaki Museum in Athens.65 Eisenberg purchased an Attic Band
Cup at the Christie’s New York auction in December 1997 that was stolen from
the Corinth Museum and reported in the International Foundation for Art Re-
search Bulletin.66

THE DONORS

The deaccessioned antiquities represent a number of significant donors, which re-
flects the complexity of the network of dealers and supporters of museums. Among
the well-known collectors were Shelby White and Leon Levy, who gave an Apulian
amphora (no. 9) in 1991 supported by funds derived from the Jerome Levy Foun-
dation (named in honor of Levy’s father). An earlier study of part of their collec-
tion exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art suggested that 84%
of the items surfaced for the first time after 1973.67 These suspicions about the
collection are seemingly well-founded: several pieces in the New York exhibition
apparently feature in the Polaroids found in Medici’s warehouse.68

An interesting blend of donors who supported the acquisition of an Apulian
bell-krater (no. 10) in 1988 included several collectors and dealers (Figure 5).
Among them were Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman; a study of their own col-
lection suggests that 91% of objects surfaced after 1973.69 Like the White-Levy
collection, a significant number of the Fleischman antiquities appear in Polaroids
from Medici’s warehouse.70 There are two London-based antiquities dealers in the
list of donors for the bell-krater: Bruce and Ingrid McAlpine and Robin Symes,
whose role in the London antiquities market is well documented.71 The associa-
tion of the krater with Jonathan H. Kagan is perhaps significant because he was
linked with William Koch and Jeffery Spier, the OKS Partnership, in the De-
kadrachm Hoard scandal; Cornelius C. Vermeule III of the MFA purportedly au-
thenticated the coins.72 Other donors toward the acquisition of the krater included
Alfred Ajami, Esther Anderson, Edith Bundy, Robert S. Czachor, Josephine L. Mur-
ray, and Catherine C. Vermeule.

Fine Arts, Boston.

Some of the donors of the deaccessioned material are closely linked to the mu-
seum. Cornelius C. Vermeule III was the Curator of Classical Art at the MFA from
1957 to 1996. He and his wife Emily, a Harvard professor respected for her re-
search on the Late Bronze Age Aegean, donated three of the deaccessioned items:
an Attic red-figured lekythos (no. 8), an Attic red-figured hydria (no. 6), and a
Roman candelabrum shaft (no. 2). Vermeule has been linked to several objects
that have surfaced in suspicious circumstances, most (in)famously the weary Her-
akles in Boston that seems to fit a fragment excavated at Perge in Turkey during
the 1980s.73

Peter Aldrich, one of the donors of deaccessioned material, was a trustee of the
MFA. He and his wife Widgie purchased and donated two of the deaccessioned
items, an Attic bell-krater (no. 5) and a Lucanian nestoris (no. 13). Peter Aldrich
is also responsible for gifts of other antiquities to MFA.74 He appears to have a
close relationship with Leon Levy because he was a former governor of the Jerome
S. Levy Economics Institute of Bard College.

REFLECTIONS ON RETURNING ANTIQUITIES

CONCLUSION

This small selection of antiquities, which has made its way back to Rome for pub-
lic display, allows a small glimpse into the murky world surrounding the acquisi-
tion of cultural artifacts from the Mediterranean world. The short time between
the Italian government’s request and the deaccessioning of the objects suggests
that the evidence was overwhelming. Yet, is this but the tip of the iceberg? Have
the present resting places of all the objects identified in Medici’s Polaroid library
been identified? Can we expect more returns?

The route by which some of the Boston antiquities traveled through the market
suggests that more deaccessioning can be expected. A key figure in the process was
Robert E. Hecht Jr. Of more than 1000 objects in the MFA reportedly handled by
Hecht, all are under suspicion for having been looted.75 It is suggested that 22
items in Boston have been identified during the Hecht trial in Rome.76 Putting
aside the coins acquired through Hecht, there is a substantial list of ancient sculp-
tures, figure-decorated pots, and other antiquities associated with his name. For
example, the Apulian situla, which was purchased by the MFA in 1992, surfaced in
the Summa Gallery in Los Angeles by 1978 before being purchased by Atlantis
Antiquities, which is part owned by Hecht.77 Was it residing in an undisclosed
private collection until 1978? Or was it removed from a cemetery in Apulia along
with so much Apulian material during the 1970s? Moreover, 61 of the 71 classical
objects acquired between 1985 and 1987 apparently have no previous history, sug-
gesting that they may have been illegally removed from archaeological contexts.78
Hecht was not just selling antiquities to the MFA; he was known for his asso-
ciation with a cup attributed to Euphronios ostensibly found with the Sarpedon
krater.79 He was also involved in the sale of an Attic black-figured Nikosthenic
amphora reputedly from Orvieto.80 What is the basis of the find-spot Orvieto? Was
it invented? Or was Hecht more open in the 1960s about the locations of his op-
erations? Hecht’s name has also been linked to part of the terra-cotta Düver frieze
looted from Turkey.81

Yet, it is the seizure of the Polaroid photographs in the Geneva Freeport that
will probably bring about the identification of objects removed from their archae-
ological contexts by tombaroli. Material in six North American museums, includ-
ing the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Princeton University Museum, and the Toledo
Museum of Art,82 has been identified. In Europe the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in
Copenhagen and the Antikensammlung in Munich have been noted as receivers
of material from Hecht, and in Japan the Miho Museum near Kyoto has the same
reputation.83

There is sadly little to celebrate over the return of these antiquities. The 13 an-
tiquities now back on Italian soil represent 13 destroyed archaeological contexts,
scientific knowledge lost forever; and the best scholarship cannot retrieve this in-
formation. The MFA’s reputation was tarnished, but its trustees should be com-
mended for coming to such a speedy decision to return the objects to Italy; and

324

hopefully, any other requests for the return of antiquities will be met with similar
alacrity. Is there an expectation that no further requests will be made by the Ital-
ian authorities? Where does this new policy leave antiquities such as the Weary
Herakles, which is claimed by Turkey? Should trustees remain in office if they are
identified as donors of material that has had to be deaccessioned? Perhaps there
will be a move toward more rigorous and ethical acquisition policies that recog-
nize the realities of the antiquities trade. Where does it leave the antiquities resid-
ing in private collections? No responsible museum curator is likely to want to accept
a gift or bequest of objects that could be the subject of a formal claim by a foreign
government; and museum trustees will want to avoid adverse publicity. Should
collectors like Shelby White seek to offer their antiquities to appropriate national
governments? The energetic calls for the repatriation of antiquities,84 however jus-
tified, should be better spent in calling for the protection of archaeological sites.
Perhaps this sorry tale of the Boston material shows the cynical acceptance of ar-
chaeological destruction by local communities, dealers, gallery directors, museum
trustees, the academics who have helped to attribute freshly surfaced objects, and
the museum curators who have been all too ready to accept fresh finds to swell
their collections and perhaps personal reputations.

POSTSCRIPT

On November 21, 2006 it was announced that the J. Paul Getty Museum had indicated to the Italian
Government that it intended to return 26 antiquities. At least 5 of the objects had formed part of the
Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman collection. Source: www.getty.edu/news/press/ (accessed on 7 De-
