General damages and an account of profits—an
Irish innovation?
David Brodsky*

Since Neilson v Betts,1 the ‘orthodox’ view has been that
damages and an account of proﬁts are mutually exclu-
sive remedies in intellectual property litigation.2,3 A re-
cent, and little-commented upon decision of the Irish
High Court,4 however, would appear to open the door
in Ireland, and perhaps elsewhere, for the granting of
both damages and an account of proﬁts. The decision
was based on an apparently novel argument, at least in
the judicial arena, to explain why the simultaneous ap-
plication of the two remedies, in the appropriate cir-
cumstances, would not be excessive.

The initial section of this article will brieﬂy review the
background and historical development of the ‘ortho-
dox’ view of the non-cumulative nature of the two reme-
dies. The second section will then present the speciﬁc
judicial arguments forming the basis of the recent Irish
court decision. Following this, the issue will be examined
from a law and economics perspective, with speciﬁc ref-
erence to the underlying logic of the Irish judgment and
a consideration of several pertinent examples.

The ‘orthodox’ view

The ‘orthodox’ view that damages and an account of
proﬁts cannot be cumulated, and that an election must
therefore be made between the two, originates from the
linked cases of Neilson v Betts (1871)5 and De Vitre v
Betts (1873).6 The unchallenged nature of the orthodox
position has been such that, as observed nearly 50 years
ago, it is ‘now trite’.7

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, in the decade and a
half preceding Neilson v Betts there had been a number
of cases in which both inquiries into damages and an
account of proﬁts were ordered.8 The possibility of
such ‘double’ awards had arisen as a result of judicial

 This article considers the ‘orthodox’ rule requiring
an election between damages or an account of
proﬁts in light of a recent Irish court decision that
would appear to open the door for the granting of
both remedies.

 Following a brief review of the background and his-
torical development of the ‘orthodox’ view, the spe-
ciﬁc judicial arguments underlying the decision are
presented. The crux of the judge’s reasoning centred
on the distinction between special and general dam-
ages. Interpreting these terms in the manner set
forth by the Irish Supreme Court for trade mark/
passing off cases, the judge concluded that the ‘rule’
requiring a plaintiff to make an election between
the two remedies refers to an election between spe-
cial damages and an account of proﬁts, so that
nothing precludes a plaintiff from making a claim
for general damages and an account of proﬁts.

 This article shows that the legal and economic
logic underlying the judgment is not easily refuted.
Moreover, at least in certain situations the ‘ortho-
dox’ position can be seen to send a clear, albeit
unintended, signal to potential infringers that they
need not worry unduly about the quality of their
workmanship, or tarnishing the victim’s trade
mark or reputation.

This has to a certain extent been called into question by the EU IP
Enforcement Directive (2004/48/EC) whose ‘ambiguous wording’ can be

dies for ‘lost proﬁts’ and ‘unfair proﬁts’. See P. Johnson, “‘Damages” in

reforms in which common law courts had been given
the possibility to order an account of proﬁts in patents
cases (18529) and courts of equity the power to award
damages in all appropriate cases (185810). The reason-
ing underlying such ‘double’ awards was explained by
Lord Chelmsford in Betts v Neilson (1868) in terms
which, as we shall see, foreshadow the reasoning of
Cregan J in the Irish case that is the principal subject of
this article:

Before Lord Cairns’ Act, 21 & 22 Vict. c. 27, damages could
only be obtained at law, and where a Plaintiff in a case of
the present description prayed for an account, but after-
wards desired to proceed at law for damages, he was not al-
lowed to do so except upon the terms of waiving his claim
to an account.. . . There is nothing in the Act to prohibit
the Court from awarding damages as well as directing an
account.. . . It is so obvious to me that in many cases the
account alone will not satisfy the entire equity of a Plaintiff,
that there being nothing against principle, nor contrary to
the enactment of the statute, in granting the double relief, I
shall hold the Vice-Chancellor’s decree to be right in this
respect.11

The award of double damages in Betts v Neilson was
reversed, however, by the House of Lords in Neilson v
Betts,12 thus laying the grounds for the orthodox policy
which has continued to the present day.

There are two basic, and fundamentally differing, expla-
nations for why the two reliefs cannot be combined. The
ﬁrst,
‘original’, one—known variously as ‘condonement
theory’,13 ‘ratiﬁcation principle’14 or ‘waiver of tort’—goes
back to Lord Westbury’s explanation in Neilson v Betts
that ‘the two things are hardly reconcilable, for if you take
an account of proﬁts you condone the infringement’.15 In
effect, the defendant acts as the plaintiff’s agent (or li-
censee), so it would be logically inconsistent for the plain-
tiff
to plead for damages once the tort has been
‘condoned’16—or more concisely put, ‘a party cannot be
permitted to approbate and reprobate’.17 The second

explanation, simpler and more ‘modern’,18 is to ensure
that ‘overlapping is prevented’,19 that is, that the plaintiff/
claimant20 is not effectively compensated twice for the
same loss.

Aldi Stores (Ireland) Limited v Dunnes
Stores (No. 3)21
This was the third decision issued by Cregan J in the
dispute involving these two parties. In the ﬁrst,22 he
had ruled that the defendant’s advertising infringed the
regulations on comparative advertising,23 as well as the
plaintiff’s trade marks. In the second,24 he had con-
cluded that the court should exercise its discretion to
grant an injunction,25 and that preliminary matters
(only) should go forward with regard to the damages
module of the trial, in view of the defendant’s stated in-
tention to appeal the issue of liability to the Court of
Appeal.26 The present case (while the liability issue was
still on appeal) concerned the defendant’s application
to the court for an order requiring the plaintiff to make
an election between (i) an inquiry into damages or (ii)
an account of proﬁts. The decision of the court, an-
nounced in March 2016, has elicited little follow-up
comment, and what little there has been has largely fo-
cused on the issue of the timing of the election, rather
than the potentially paradigm-changing ruling on the
fundamental nature of the election.

After reviewing the relevant UK and Irish authorities,
Cregan J turned to an analysis of fundamental princi-
ples.27 He ﬁrst noted that:

It is clear from the authorities that there is a rule of law in
trademark and patent infringement cases that a plaintiff
who has established an infringement must make an election
between an inquiry into damages or an account of proﬁts.
However the scope of this rule, the operation of this rule
and the underlying principles or rationale for the rule are
not so clear.

Therefore if a plaintiff could recover damages for his loss
of proﬁts on his loss of sales and also obtain an award of
the defendant’s proﬁts on his sales he would enjoy an
unmerited windfall. He would, in effect, recover ‘on the
double’. This would mean that a plaintiff would be ‘over-
compensated’ and a defendant would be ‘over-penalised’.

However, courts should not apply this rule (for an
election) in a ‘mechanistic’ way; rather they should seek
to:

understand the rationale for the rule and to apply it in
each case in an appropriate manner to ensure justice is
done to the plaintiff for the infringement whilst also ensur-
ing that the plaintiff is not over-compensated in a manner
which would do an injustice to the defendant.

Special versus general damages

The judge then turned to what for him was the crux of
the issue—the distinction between special and general
damages.28 While these terms have not always been in-
terpreted in a uniform manner,29 in the context of trade
mark infringement and passing off they have been de-
ﬁned by the Irish Supreme Court as follows:30

special damages: ‘pecuniary loss’, speciﬁcally ‘all ﬁnancial
loss such as loss of business proﬁts or expenses incurred’
general damages: ‘non-pecuniary loss’, speciﬁcally ‘damage
to reputation or goodwill’

Cregan J then observed that a plaintiff was clearly enti-
tled to recover both special damages and general dam-
ages, so deﬁned, and that in such case it was clear there
would be no overcompensation. But ‘if that be so, then
it cannot be argued that a plaintiff who is seeking general
damages and an account of proﬁts is being over-com-
pensated’ since one pecuniary measure (special damages)
is effectively being substituted by another (account of
proﬁts).31 Not surprisingly, the defendant objected stren-
uously to this radical reformulation of the ‘election’ be-
tween damages and an account of proﬁts, and cited
numerous judicial authorities in support. However,

29 With regard to special damages, a difﬁculty noted judicially at least as

early as 1892: ‘Lest we should be led astray in such a matter by mere
words, it is desirable to recollect that the term “special damage”, which is
found for centuries in the books, is not always used with reference to
similar subject-matter, nor in the same context’; Ratcliffe v Evans [1892]

See further discussion below in the section ‘A law and economics
perspective’.

[T]he defendant ... accepted that it was not able to point to
a single case which clearly stated the proposition that a
plaintiff must make an election between a right of general
damages or an account of proﬁts.

The judge’s view was that ‘the case law, when properly
analysed, in fact refers to an election between the plain-
tiff’s right to special damages (not general damages) or
an account of the defendant’s proﬁts’.

Thus, he concluded that:

the rule of law which requires a plaintiff to make an elec-
tion between an inquiry as to damages or an account of
proﬁts must mean an election between the plaintiff’s in-
quiry as to special damages or an account of the defen-
dant’s proﬁts.

Hence the plaintiff’s claim to general damages (in addi-
tion to an account of proﬁts) remained ‘intact’.

In April 2017, the decision in the original case32 was
reversed by the Court of Appeal,33 thus converting the
radical reformulation of the orthodox doctrine set forth
by Cregan J into an obiter dicta. It remains to be seen
whether this radical reformulation will be followed in fu-
ture trade mark infringement/passing off cases in Ireland.

A law and economics perspective

The key to the judicial reasoning set forth by Cregan J
is the inherent substitutability of special damages and
an account of proﬁts. This inherent substitutability also
emerges directly from an economic analysis of the na-
ture of damages themselves. In relation to the economic
torts, the classic deﬁnition of damages is that provided
by Lord Wilberforce in General Tire and Rubber Co v
Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd:34 ‘that sum of money
which will put the injured party in the same position as
he would have been in if he had not sustained the
wrong’.

From the point of view of the ﬁrm that has suffered
infringement (or passing off), the economic value of
damages, so deﬁned, can be decomposed into two basic
elements: (a) those that have already occurred (ie back-
ward-looking) and are ‘precisely quantiﬁable’; and (b)
those that will occur, or at least are foreseeable (ie for-
ward-looking) and can only be estimated.35 The former

[1976] RPC 197 at 212. In Ireland this deﬁnition of damages was cited by
the Irish Supreme Court in connection with trade mark infringement/
passing off in Tommy Hilﬁger Europe v McGarry & ors (above n 30).

can be calculated as the loss of proﬁts suffered in the pe-
riod from the start of infringement to the present. The
latter, on the other hand, can be estimated as the de-
crease in the present value of the anticipated stream of fu-
ture proﬁts. As the italicized term is effectively the
economic/ﬁnancial deﬁnition of ‘goodwill’,36 forward-
looking damages can thus be seen to compensate for
damages to goodwill.

Hence the dichotomy backward- versus forward-
looking damages essentially reduces to the deﬁnition
adopted by the Irish Supreme Court37 for special and
general damages that was used by Cregan J as the basic
starting point for his legal argument. Viewed in this
context, it is clear that an account of proﬁts, which is
entirely backward-looking, can properly be viewed as a
substitute only for special damages, and is completely
independent of forward-looking general damages.

A practical illustration

By way of example, in a trade mark/passing off context,
assume that Firms A and B produce essentially identical
goods in a ‘branded’ market where consumers select
based on personal brand preferences (beer, breakfast ce-
reals, etc). Now assume that Firm B commits trade
mark infringement and/or passing off by marketing its
goods under Firm A’s brand-name. Firm B’s ‘illicit’
sales are £20 million, with proﬁts of £10 million, so that
an award to Firm A of an account of proﬁts would pro-
vide compensation of £10 million. In this case ‘special’
damages—speciﬁcally,
‘the loss of business proﬁts’—
can be calculated as the additional proﬁts that Firm A
would have earned if it had been able to produce and
sell the ‘illicit’ goods in place of Firm B.38

Relationship between an account of proﬁts
and special damages

The relationship between an account of proﬁts and cal-
culated (‘special’) damages will depend on a number of
factors. In the above example, ceteris paribus, it will be
a function of the relative costs of production of the two
ﬁrms and the extent to which, if any, Firm A has capac-
ity limitations that would have restricted its ability to
recapture the sales ‘stolen’ by Firm B. This is illustrated
in the table below, where a capacity constraint of 50%

means that Firm A could have produced only 50% of
the ‘stolen’ sales, and 100% means it had no capacity to
increase production.

case

Thus,

in the

‘normal’

(italicized)—equal
production costs and no binding capacity constraint—
special damages and an account of proﬁts are both £10
million, so that the two remedies truly are reverse sides
of the coin. In the other cases, there will generally be a
divergence between the two,39 and it will obviously be
in Firm A’s interest to elect the remedy offering larger
recompense. Where in certain cases it might thus ap-
pear to be in Firm A’s interest to turn a ‘blind eye’ to
the infringement/passing off, and later reclaim all of
Firm B’s proﬁts (which would exceed Firm A’s calcu-
lated damages), the court in such cases will likely refuse
to order an account of proﬁts, or will limit the account
to the period before the plaintiff/claimant became
aware of the infringement/passing off.40

Note that, to this point, the issue of general damages
does not arise: there is no damage to reputation or
goodwill, or other non-pecuniary loss. In other words,
using the terminology employed earlier, there are no
‘forward-looking’ damages. Of course, during the pe-
riod of the infringement/passing off, there is a real ‘con-
fusion’ as to source (and a ‘dilution’ of Firm A’s mark),
but this disappears the moment the offending action
ceases, leaving (special) damages to be calculated pre-
cisely as above.

General damages

Let us take as our ‘base’ case the one above in which
Firm A has a 50% supply constraint and equal costs to
Firm B. Then calculated (special) damages, according
to the table, will be £5 million, and Firm A will clearly
elect an account of proﬁts which will compensate it
with £10 million.

mated as the present value of the future income to be earned from pro-
viding future goods or services to future, unidentiﬁed, customers.’ R. F.

(AICPA, New York, 2014), 709.

38 Plus any additional expenses incurred to date as a result of the infringe-

ment, assumed to be zero.

39 The remedies will also turn out to be equal if Firm A’s capacity limitation
is precisely compensated for by its lower cost of production. Thus, in the
above example, if Firm A can produce 80% of ‘stolen’ sales and has a
25% cost advantage, it would have had increased sales of £16 million and
increased costs of only £6 million, leaving it with ‘special’ damages of £10
million.

Now, let us assume that Firm B produces an inferior
product, but everything else remains the same. In addi-
tion to the special damages that can be calculated as £5
million, there will now be general damages resulting
from the damage to Firm A’s goodwill/reputation aris-
ing from its association with an inferior product—con-
sumers will of course hold Firm A responsible for Firm
B’s shoddy workmanship. Let us further assume that
this damage to goodwill/reputation can be valued at £3
million; this might represent, for example, the projected
future cost of an advertising campaign informing the
public that Firm A was the ‘innocent’ party and not to
be held responsible for the temporary decline in quality.
Under the ‘orthodox’ approach, Firm A would be given
the following choice:

case, Firm B pays an explicit price for the (additional)
damage to goodwill/reputation.

This example clearly illustrates that, at least in cer-
tain circumstances,42 the orthodox approach effec-
tively sends an all-too-clear message to potential
infringers that they are free to produce shoddy mer-
chandise (within limits43) or otherwise ‘tarnish’ the
trade mark or reputation of the ﬁrm: should they
eventually be called to account for their transgression,
the amount they will have to pay will be independent
of the quality of the goods they produce44 or the re-
sulting tarnishment of the mark/reputation. This is
clearly an undesirable result however one looks at it,
and it is perhaps the single strongest argument for al-
lowing the simultaneous award of general damages
and an account of proﬁts.

Total Damages
¼ £8 million
Special¼ £5 million
General¼ £3 million

or

Account of Proﬁts
¼ £10 million

Conclusion

Obviously in this case, it would once again elect the
account of proﬁts of £10 million. Comparing this out-
come with the previous case (no general damages), it is
clear that Firm B will effectively escape liability for the
additional damage to goodwill/reputation that it has
caused.41

On the other hand,

if the ‘Irish’ approach were
adopted, Firm A would have the possibility of opting
for general damages plus an account of proﬁts, thus
providing total compensation of £13 million. In this

The decision in Aldi Stores v Dunnes Stores (3), al-
though now rendered obiter dicta, merits further con-
sideration. The legal and economic logic underlying the
judgment—allowing the cumulative remedy of general
damages plus an account of proﬁts in trade mark and
passing off cases45—is not easily refuted. Moreover,
from a law and economics perspective, it can easily be
conﬁrmed that, at least in certain situations, the ‘ortho-
dox’ position sends a clear, albeit unintended, signal to
potential infringers that they need not worry unduly
about the quality of their workmanship, or tarnishing
the victim’s trade mark or reputation.

41 Thus representing one of the ‘many cases’ noted by Lord Chelmsford in
Betts v Neilson where ‘the account alone will not satisfy the entire equity
of a Plaintiff’ (above, n 11).

42 Namely, when the ‘victim’ ﬁrm has limited capacity and/or when the po-

43

tential infringer is a low-cost producer.
In this example, if Firm B were to ‘overdo’ the shoddiness to the extent
that general damages rose above £5 million, it would face a potential
compensation bill in excess of £10 million.

44 Note that if the reduction in quality is due to reduced costs, Firm A will

receive additional compensation since the account of proﬁts will increase.
So for the purposes of the example it is assumed that the inferior quality
is due simply to shoddy workmanship arising from the lack of
accountability.

45 And, by extension, in other intellectual property disputes.
