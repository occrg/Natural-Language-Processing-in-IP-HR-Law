Copyright in custom code: Who owns
commissioned software?
T. J. McIntyre*

The recent decisions in R Griggs Group Ltd v Evans1
and Clearsprings Management Limited v Businesslinx
Limited and others2 show that some confusion remains
as to the issues surrounding ownership of commis-
sioned works generally and software in particular. This
article examines the ownership of commissioned soft-
ware in England and Ireland together with the rules of
law which might modify or limit the effects of that
ownership.3

An understandable misconception
There is a popular misconception that a person who
commissions and pays for work automatically owns
that work. This belief is understandable: as Groves puts
it: ‘If you pay someone to do something for you, you
generally expect to own the product of their labour.’4
This myth, like many others, is based on a grain of
truth: until recently, both English and Irish copyright
law5 provided for ownership of certain commissioned
artistic works (such as photographs and engravings) to
vest in the client.6

However, popular understanding has failed to keep up
with legislative change. In both England7 and Ireland,8
the commissioned works exceptions have been elimi-
nated: the author of a commissioned work is now the
ﬁrst owner of the copyright unless the author is an
employee in the course of employment or the work falls
within other narrow statutory exceptions.9

Consequently, in the case of commissioned software,
copyright initially vests in the author, not the client.

Key issues
† Despite the fundamental nature of the principles
governing authorship and ownership of copyright
in protected works, substantial uncertainty still
shrouds
in
works generated in pursuit of a contractual com-
mission, particularly in the ﬁeld of computer
software.

the allocation of property rights

† Areas of uncertainty include not only those in
which the commissioning contract is silent as to
ownership and other issues but also those in
which, in addition to copyright, database right
may also be created, as well as those in which
legal rights may be in conﬂict with authors’
moral rights.

† This article examines case law relating to copy-
right in commissioned works and seeks to apply
it to contemporary problems within the ﬁeld of
software creation, leading to the conclusion that
the most prudent practice is
to ensure that
express contract terms are employed wherever
possible.

A client who wishes to acquire the copyright must
agree this with the author, who must then assign it.
Moreover, the assignment will be ineffective unless it
is in writing and signed by or on behalf of
the
assignor.10 An unwritten agreement or understanding
as to ownership—however clear—will not sufﬁce.

An unsuspecting client may receive merely a licence
to use the work. This can come as a surprise. Depend-
ing on the nature of the licence, it may be forbidden
to modify software11 and there may be no access to
the source code.12 Licensees ﬁnd themselves unable to
distribute the software further. They may need to pur-
chase the copyright—in effect paying twice for the
work. In a worst-case scenario, the author may even
sell the work to a competitor (as happened in R Griggs
Group Ltd v Evans13).

The fact that a person is mistaken as to what has
been purchased does not of itself justify legal interven-
tion. Normal commercial practice is for the parties to
specify, by way of written agreement, the precise rights
which are being purchased.14 Such an agreement is
essential in the case of all copyright works, given that a
variety of rights might be transferred, from a limited
non-exclusive licence to an outright assignment of
copyright. Where the client has failed to secure such an
agreement, it might be said that the courts should not
rewrite their foolish bargain, reﬂecting the policy of the
legislation, which vests ownership in the author by
default and requires clear steps to transfer that owner-
ship.15 One might even say that in such a case the
client is attempting to secure rights that were neither
bargained nor paid for.

In some circumstances, however, the statutory rules
as to ownership and transfer of ownership might work
an injustice. As Millard explains:

The automatic operation of the rules as to ﬁrst ownership
may produce results that are contrary to the reasonable
commercial expectations of one or more of the parties. For
example, the commissioning party may contribute a brilli-
ant original concept and pay all the costs of its subsequent
development and implementation, yet end up with no
legal rights of ownership in the ﬁnal product. Even if it
had been understood from the start, and possibly even
agreed orally, that the commissioner would in all respects

17 The legitimacy of this judicial reasoning is questionable in that it

undermines the statutory scheme as to ownership. For discussion of this

‘own’ the product, this will not be sufﬁcient to alter the
operation of the ﬁrst-ownership rules. This is because . . .
assignments of copyright and agreements as to future own-
ership of copyright will only be enforceable if they are evi-
denced in writing. . . .16

In response,
the courts have developed principles
which may allow the commissioner to assert rights
over a work notwithstanding that there is no written
agreement or assignment concerning ownership.17

Equitable ownership
Although statute vests legal ownership in the author,
the courts have held that, where a speciﬁcally enforce-
able contract requires assignment of the copyright, the
commissioner will be treated as the owner in equity18
and the author can be ordered to execute an assign-
ment.19 Consequently, the lack of a written assignment
or agreement is not necessarily fatal.

Limitations of equitable ownership
However, equitable ownership may leave the client in a
precarious position. So long as the author retains legal
title, there is a risk of conveying that title to a bona ﬁde
purchaser for value without notice, defeating the com-
missioner’s equitable interest.20 Further, the right to
seek an assignment is equitable and therefore discre-
tionary, creating a risk that the court may refuse the
assignment or grant it only on terms.21

Equitable owners also face difﬁculties in protecting
rights against third parties. They may commence pro-
ceedings22 and take them to the stage of obtaining
interlocutory relief, but a ﬁnal injunction or damages
will not be available unless they join the legal owner as
a party to the action.23

Implied terms as to ownership
and implied licences
Before equitable ownership can be asserted, it must be
shown that there is an agreement that ownership will vest
in the commissioner. Explicit agreement rarely exists—
disputes arise precisely because the parties fail to address
the point. Consequently, the court must reconstruct the
parties’ intentions, asking whether a term dealing with
ownership can be implied into the contract.24

This was summarized in Clearsprings:25

It is now well established that where a party (‘the client’)
uses the services of an independent contractor (‘the con-
tractor’) to perform work involving the creation of a copy-
right work, the circumstances may be such that there will
be implied into the contract an agreement that the con-
tractor will in due course assign the copyright so created
to the client. Where the circumstances do not justify the
implication of an obligation to assign, the law may never-
theless require the implication of a licence, whether exclu-
sive or otherwise, and on such terms as may be necessary
to give business efﬁcacy to the contract.26

This passage also makes it clear that this is a ﬂexible
approach which permits several possible outcomes: a
term may be implied that ownership vests in the client;
there may be no implied term, ownership remaining in
the author; or the contract may be found to give the
client an implied licence in respect of the software but
falling short of full ownership.

Case law27
Massine v de Basil28
De Basil hired Massine to choreograph a ballet which
de Basil’s company would perform. A dispute arose as
to the ownership of copyright in the choreography. The
Court of Appeal held in favour of de Basil, ﬁnding that
Massine was acting as an employee. However, Lord
Justice Greene held, obiter, that even if Massine were an
independent contractor

it ought to be implied as a term of the agreement that any
work done by the plaintiff would be done on the basis that
the defendant who had paid for the work should be
entitled to such rights as might arise from that payment.29

24 The ﬁrst case to take this approach appears to be Sweet v Benning (1855)

16 CB 459 where Jervis CJ held that there was an implied term that
barristers preparing headnotes for cases did so on the basis that
copyright would vest in the publisher, stating that ‘there is an implied
condition, understanding, or arrangement between the proprietors of
the Jurist and the gentlemen who furnish the reports or other articles for
publication therein, that the former shall acquire a copyright in the
articles so written and published and paid for by him’.
[2005] EWHC 1487.

25

The court considered that the ballet was made up of
numerous elements including the music, the story, the
choreography,
the scenery, and the costumes; both
parties must have intended that the copyright in each
element was to be held by de Basil:

The choreography was but one part of a composite whole.
The defendant had paid the money under the agreement
for the supplying to his ballet of a part which was necess-
ary for its completeness, and unless he was entitled to the
copyright in that part of the ballet he would not be getting
that beneﬁt from the contract which must have been the
intention of the parties.30

That decision therefore looked to the commercial
reality behind the transaction, ﬁnding in effect that
the ballet could not be performed as intended without
the copyright being vested in the client. Signiﬁcantly,
the court did not ask whether an implied term falling
short of an assignment would sufﬁce. Later cases have
paid more attention to the extent of the implied term.

Blair v Osborne and Tompkins;
Stovin-Bradford v Volpoint Properties
The Court of Appeal heard these cases, within 6
months of one another, on essentially the same
issue—the extent of the implied licence granted by
an architect to a client who commissioned drawings.
In both, the clients had commissioned drawings to
obtain planning permission;
the clients
built in reliance on those plans but without enga-
ging the architect. Each architect had been engaged
under
Institute of British Architects
(RIBA) conditions. These speciﬁed that they retained
copyright in the drawings but were silent as to what
uses could be made of the drawings.

In Blair,31 the court took a wide view of the implied

licence, holding (per Lord Denning MR) that

When the owner of a building plot employs an architect to
prepare plans for a house on that site, the architect impli-
edly promises that, in return for his fee, he will give a
licence to the owner to use the plans for the building on
that site. The copyright remains in the architect, so that he
can stop anyone else copying his plans, or making a house
from them; but he cannot stop the owner, who employed
him, from doing work on that very site in accordance with

the plans. If the owner employs a builder or another archi-
tect, the implied licence extends so as to enable them to
make copies of the plans and to use them for that very
building on that site: but for no other purpose. If the
owner should sell the site, the implied licence extends so
as to avail the purchaser also.32

Blair, however, had been paid the full RIBA scale fee. In
Stovin-Bradford,33 the court was presented with very
similar facts, but
received what was
described as a ‘nominal fee’ for the drawings, less than
one-ninth of the RIBA scale fee. Megaw LJ emphasized:

the architect

[I]f
it appears that the fee agreed is substantially less
than full compensation, that is a factor, and it may be a
very important factor, in deciding upon the proper impli-
cation as to the contractual term to be implied in respect
of the licence. An architect may reasonably and sensibly
agree to a lower remuneration than his services would
normally deserve for the full use of the licence, because
of the realisation that if planning permission is refused,
or for some other reason the building work does not
proceed, the owner will not beneﬁt substantially from the
architect’s work. But such an agreement would be neither
reasonable nor sensible, if the agreement is viewed objec-
tively, unless it is made on the further assumption that,
if planning permission is granted on the basis of the
plans and the owner thereafter desires to make further
use of the copyright in the plans, such further use shall
be the subject-matter of
further remuneration to the
architect.’34

the sum paid may be relevant

Thus
in deciding
whether a client has ‘bought’ the copyright in the
work, or extensive rights in the work;
later case law
has generally taken the fee into account. However, the
signiﬁcance of these decisions should not be overstated.
In both, the work to be carried out and the applicable
scale of fees were essentially standardized within a well-
deﬁned industry framework. It is harder to decide, in
respect of software, whether a person has been paid
‘less than full compensation’ when there is no equi-
valent of the RIBA scales. Indeed, in Clearsprings,35 the
court found the amount paid was of no assistance
where there was no evidence of industry norms.

Warner v Gestetner36
The plaintiff, an illustrator, was hired for a ﬁxed fee of
£900 to prepare drawings of cats which would be used
to promote Gestetner’s business. The drawings, initially

prepared for use in an exhibition launching a particular
product, were later modiﬁed by the defendants and
used for national press advertising and product label-
ling. There being no express agreement as to the
parties’ respective rights, the plaintiff claimed that he
retained the copyright and that the defendants had
obtained a limited licence to use the drawings for the
purpose of the product launch.

The court considered ‘the general usage in the trade’
and the size of the fee paid to see whether the payment
was consistent with the grant of a full interest or a
limited licence. It held that an implied term passing
copyright
to the defendants was necessary to give
business efﬁcacy to the agreement since it ‘must have
been the intention of the parties’ that the defendants
‘should acquire an unrestricted interest in the use of
the drawings’.

John Richardson Computers Ltd v Flanders
The ﬁrst decision to apply these principles to soft-
ware was John Richardson.37 This well-known case
involved software for pharmacy management. The
software was initially developed by Richardson, who
later incorporated and assigned the copyright to his
company (the plaintiff). The company then hired two
independent contractors, Howarth and Worthington,
to reﬁne and improve the software. Subsequently, the
company engaged Flanders (the ﬁrst defendant) as an
employee to maintain and upgrade the software and to
rewrite the software for use on BBC computers. Flanders
resigned as an employee 3 years later, but continued to
work for the company as a consultant for a further year,
during which time he added features to the software and
converted it
to assembly language. The relationship
between the company and Flanders later broke down
and Flanders became involved in developing a compet-
ing product.

The plaintiff alleged that this product infringed the
copyright in its software, which required the court to
decide who owned the copyright as regards the changes
made by the two independent contractors (Howarth
and Worthington) and the changes made by Flanders
when he was no longer an employee. There being no
written agreement in place dealing with copyright, the
court applied Massine38 and vested equitable title in
the work carried out by Howarth, Worthington, and

Ibcos Computers v Barclays Mercantile
If the relationship between the parties can be character-
ized as a partnership, it may be possible to ﬁnd an
implied term that ownership is to vest in the partner-
ship rather than the author. In Ibcos,39 a programmer,
Poole, wrote an accounts payroll package. He licensed
it to Clayton, an agricultural dealer, who realized the
sales potential of the software if it were modiﬁed for
his industry. Clayton discussed the necessary changes
with Poole and paid him to modify the software for his
needs, both parties understanding that the result of
their co-operation would be a program which could be
sold to agricultural dealers. Both then began to sell the
software, each describing themselves as ‘partners’. They
later carried on business via a company, PK, which
employed Poole. When Poole later left PK, he signed
an agreement ‘recognising’ that the software sold by PK
was ‘the sole property’ of that company and containing
a 2-year non-compete clause. He subsequently wrote
software which was alleged to infringe the copyright in
the software sold by PK

One issue which arose was the ownership of the soft-
ware which was written or modiﬁed in the period
before the parties started trading via the company.
Jacob J concluded that Poole and Clayton were in an
informal partnership and that there was an implied
term that copyright of software written during this
period would vest in the partnership:

[T]he program as it then stood was the very foundation of
the venture. Moreover even though he had not contributed
to it by way of programming, Mr. Clayton contributed
to it in other ways—by considerable discussion as to what
the program should do and by some payment. [It was]
suggested that he was doing that solely for his own beneﬁt.
I do not so hold on the evidence. He was for some time
with Mr. Poole intending that the developments should
result in a vendible product. No doubt he also got a
beneﬁt in his own business but the parties’ intention at
the time was a two-fold beneﬁt. I think it was indeed
‘absolutely necessary’ that the company should own the
copyright in the program as it was in 1982. If the position
were otherwise once the program was established commer-
cially Mr. Poole could have left the company and sold the

same product on his own account. Or if there was a third
party pirate, it would not be the company’s right to sue
for infringement and claim damages. Neither of

In Saphena,41 the defendant, a debt collection agency,
commissioned the plaintiff to supply it with a package

business. The software proved to be bug-ridden and
the
two broke down.
An agreement was reached over the telephone, termi-

the software, brought proceedings alleging copyright

The defendants claimed that they were entitled in
equity to the copyright in the software since it was
commissioned by them and was customized for their
particular needs alone. The court42 rejected this argu-
ment, ﬁnding that there was an express agreement that
copyright would remain in the plaintiff: however, even
without such an agreement, it was clear that copyright
would remain in the plaintiff:

the commissioning of a computer program by a person is

to that person. The same must clearly apply to the bene-
ﬁcial
interest in the copyright. The matters particularly
relied upon by the defendants . . . are in my judgment the
ordinary incidents of commissioning.43

Was there an implied term that the defendant could
use the source code for the purpose of repairing and
improving the software? There were two separate con-
tracts where such a term might be implied.

The ﬁrst was the initial agreement commissioning
the software. The court held that a contract providing
for a party to receive source code would normally
indicate an implied term entitling that party to use the
source code for the purpose of repairing or improving

to supply the object code only, so that the defendants
would not beneﬁt from such an implied term. Conse-
quently, the defendant was not entitled, on the basis of
the commissioning agreement, to access or use the
source code in order to repair or improve the software.
The second was the telephone agreement terminat-

reached, the software was not ﬁt for its purpose and
the parties were still in the process of identifying and
eliminating bugs. The court found that the parties
could not have intended that
the software should
remain bug-ridden and incomplete once the plaintiff
withdrew. Consequently, business efﬁcacy required
the implication of a term permitting the defendant to
use the source code to the extent necessary to render
the software reasonably ﬁt for the purpose speciﬁed.
That implied term did not entitle the defendant to
use the source code to make improvements to the
software.45

Ray v Classic FM
Soon afterwards, Lightman J restated the law in Ray46 a
judgment—described as ‘masterful’ by the Court of
Appeal47—which is now the starting point for any
analysis of ownership of commissioned work.

Ray, a well-known classical music expert, was hired
by Classic FM as a consultant to draw up a database
of popular classics. This database, which assigned a
popularity rating and various categories to each piece,
thus enabling an automated system to decide what
pieces to play, proved so successful that Classic FM
wished to licence foreign radio stations to use copies of
it. A dispute arose between Ray and Classic FM as to
whether they could do so, the consultancy agreement
being silent on the question.

Lightman J, in a detailed and comprehensive judg-
ment, identiﬁed48 nine propositions as representing the
law in this area:

1. the Contractor is entitled to retain the copyright in
default of some express or implied term to the con-
trary effect;

44 This aspect of the judgment is undermined by the growing use of

interpreted rather than compiled languages, as interpreted languages
such as JavaScript allow a program to be executed directly from source
code without the need to supply object code, blurring the distinction
between the two.

45 The facts of this case predate Council Directive 91/250 (as implemented

by Sections 81(1) and 82(1) CRRA and Sections 50B and 50C CDPA),
which permits limited decompilation and adaptation of software for
purposes of ‘error correction’ or ‘interoperability’. As a result of that
directive, a software purchaser would now enjoy greater rights to repair

2. the contract itself may expressly provide as to who
shall be entitled to the copyright in work produced
pursuant to the contract. Thus under a standard
form ‘RIBA’ contract between an architect and his
client, there is an express provision that the copy-
right shall remain vested in the architect;

3. the mere fact that the Contractor has been commis-
sioned is insufﬁcient to entitle the Client to the
copyright. Where Parliament intended the act of
commissioning alone to vest copyright in the Client,
eg in the case of unregistered design rights and regis-
tered designs, the legislation expressly so provides.
In all other cases, the Client has to establish the enti-
tlement under some express or implied term of the
contract;

4. the law governing the implication of terms in a con-
tract has been ﬁrmly established (if not earlier) by
the decision of the House of Lords in Liverpool City
Council v Irwin.49 In the words of Lord Bingham
MR in Philips Electronique v BSB,50 the essence of
much learning on implied terms is distilled in the
speech of Lord Simon of Glaisdale on behalf of the
majority of
the Privy
Council in BP Reﬁnery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v the
President, Councillors, and Ratepayers of the Shire of
Hastings:51

the Judicial Committee of

Their Lordships do not think it necessary to review
exhaustively the authorities on the implication of a
term in a contract which the parties have not thought
ﬁt to express. In their view, for a term to be implied,
the following conditions (which may overlap) must be
satisﬁed: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it
must be necessary to give business efﬁcacy to the con-
tract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is
effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that ‘it
goes without saying’; (4) it must be capable of clear
expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term
of the contract.

Lord Bingham added an explanation and warning:

The courts’ usual role in contractual interpretation is,
by resolving ambiguities or
reconciling apparent
inconsistencies, to attribute the true meaning to the
language

expressed their contract. The implication of contract
terms involves a different and altogether more ambi-
tious undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal
with matters for which, ex hypothesi, the parties them-
selves have made no provision. It is because the impli-
cation of terms is so potentially intrusive that the law
imposes strict constraints on the exercise of this extra-
ordinary power.

. . .
The question of whether a term should be implied,
and if so what, almost inevitably arises after a crisis has
been reached in the performance of the contract. So the
court comes to the task of implication with the beneﬁt
of hindsight, and it is tempting for the court then to
fashion a term which will reﬂect the merits of the situ-
ation as they then appear. Tempting, but wrong.

5. where (as in the present case) it is necessary to imply
the grant of some right to ﬁll a lacuna in the contract
and the question arises how this lacuna is to be ﬁlled,
guidance is again to be found in Liverpool. The prin-
ciple is clearly stated that in deciding which of various
alternatives should constitute the contents of the term
to be implied, the choice must be that which does not
exceed what is necessary in the circumstances. In short
a minimalist approach is called for. An implication
may only be made if this is necessary, and then only of
what is necessary and no more;

6. accordingly, if it is necessary to imply some grant of
rights in respect of a copyright work, and the need
could be satisﬁed by the grant of a licence or an
assignment of the copyright, the implication will be
of the grant of a licence only;

7. circumstances may exist when the necessity for an
assignment of copyright may be established. As
Mr Howe has submitted, these circumstances are,
however, only likely to arise if the Client needs in
addition to the right to use the copyright works the
right to exclude the Contractor from using the work
and the ability to enforce the copyright against third
parties. Examples of when this situation may arise
include:
(a) where the purpose in commissioning the work is
for the Client to multiply and sell copies on the
market for which the work was created free
from the sale of copies in competition with the
Client by the Contractor or third parties;

(b) where the Contractor creates a work which is
the

derivative from a pre-existing work of

Client, eg when a draughtsman is engaged to
turn designs of an article in sketch form by the
Client into formal manufacturing drawings, and
the draughtsman could not use the drawings
himself without infringing the underlying rights
of the Client;

(c) where the Contractor is engaged as part of a
team with employees of the Client to produce a
composite or joint work and he is unable, or
cannot have been intended to be able, to exploit
for his own beneﬁt the joint work or indeed any
distinct contribution of his own created in the
course of his engagement.52

In each case, it is necessary to consider the price paid,
the impact on the Contractor of assignment of copy-
right, and whether it can sensibly have been intended
that the Contractor should retain any copyright as a
separate item of property;

8. if necessity requires only the grant of a licence, the
ambit of the licence must be the minimum which is
required to secure to the Client
the entitlement
which the parties to contract must have intended to
confer upon him. The amount of the purchase price
which the Client under the contract has obliged
himself to pay may be relevant to the ambit of the
licence. Thus in Stovin-Bradford v Volpoint Properties
Ltd,53 where the Client agreed to pay only a nominal
fee to his architect for the preparation of plans, he
was held to have a licence to use the plans for no
purpose beyond the anticipated application for plan-
ning permission. In contrast, in Blair v Osborne and
Tompkins,54 where the client was charged the full
RIBA scale fee, his licence was held to extend to
using the plans for the building itself. Guidance
as to the approach to be adopted is provided in a
passage in the judgment of Jacobs J in Beck v
Montana Construction Pty Ltd55cited with approval
by Widgery LJ in Blair v Osborne and Tompkins:56

it seems to me that the principle involved is this; that
the engagement for reward of a person to produce
material of a nature which is capable of being the
subject of copyright implies a permission, or consent,
or licence in the person giving the engagement to use
the material
in the manner and for the purpose in
which and for which it was contemplated between
the parties that it would be used at the time of the
engagement.

9. the licence accordingly is to be limited to what is in
the joint contemplation of the parties at the date
of the contract, and does not extend to enable the
Client to take advantage of a new unexpected proﬁt-
able opportunity.

Applying these principles, there was an implied licence
for Classic FM to use the database for the purpose of
their business in the UK and there was an implied obli-
gation on Ray not to licence the database to any com-
petitor in the UK. However, the court declined to ﬁnd
an implied licence for Classic FM to make copies of the
database for use abroad, much less an implied agree-
ment that copyright would be assigned to it.

Lightman J noted that earlier case law had been more
generous in ﬁnding implied agreements that copyright
would be assigned, but held that the precedental value
of these cases was limited. In most of those cases, it was
assumed that, if a term was to be an implied, it should
be an assignment—the alternative of a licence was
simply not considered. Also, before the Copyright Act
1956, an exclusive licence could not grant the right to
pursue an action against third party infringers. Before
that date, for a party to defend its rights, it was necess-
ary for the copyright to be assigned.57

Classic FM also argued that the amount paid to Ray
under the contract—some £250,000 in all—indicated
that ‘the parties could not have intended so limited a
licence as the return’58 for those fees. This argument
failed. In deciding on an implied term, the court must
look to the situation as it existed on the day the con-
tract was entered into, without the beneﬁt of hindsight.
In this case, Ray was paid on a daily rate: the court
found that when the contract was signed the parties
did not contemplate ‘such a lengthy and extensive use
of his services’.59

Paciﬁc Software Technology v Perry Group
The New Zealand decision in Paciﬁc Software60 illus-
trates an important issue:
if a commissioner obtains
copyright in software, how will this affect pre-existing
(‘library’) code which is incorporated into the software?
Perry commissioned a new database program from
Paciﬁc Software. There was no express agreement as to
ownership of the copyright in the program, but under
Section 21 of the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994,

in

computer

commissioned

programs
copyright
automatically vested in the commissioner. Paciﬁc Soft-
ware claimed that approximately 85 per cent of the
code consisted of pre-existing library code developed
before the commission and which it wished to reuse in
other applications. The question arose as to whether
copyright in that code vested in the Perry.

At ﬁrst instance it was held that it did: the commis-
sioner became the sole owner of the entire software
and all IP incorporated in it. This caused some concern
in the local industry, giving rise to fears that software
developers might inadvertently lose control over their
library code.61 On appeal, however, the Court of Appeal
considered that
the automatic vesting of copyright
should apply only to the speciﬁc code developed in
fulﬁlment of the commission, with the commissioner
acquiring a licence in respect of the library code. In
reaching this conclusion, the Court was inﬂuenced by
industry norms, noting that code reuse was a common
practice:

This . . . point is of distinct practical importance. Software
developers, as this case illustrates, are obviously storing
routines developed for prior projects in what amounts to
virtual libraries, and then reusing them by cobbling them
into new programs. The philosophy of ‘write once, use
many times’ is efﬁcient in economic terms, and indeed has
historic parallels in such things as lawyers’ use of written
precedents
conveyancing and Court
forms’.62

This point has since been echoed by Clearsprings,63 dis-
cussed later. Consequently,
is unlikely that any
implied term as to copyright will be taken to transfer
ownership of library code to the commissioning party.

under two trade marks: stylized ‘Dr Martens’ and
‘AirWair’ logos. In 1988, they decided to combine the
two marks and commissioned an advertising agency to
do so. The advertising agency in turn gave this task to
Evans, who worked for them on a freelance basis at a
standard rate of £15 per hour. His invoice indicated
that he was to produce ‘updated UK point of sale
materials’. There was no express agreement as to copy-
right in the new, merged logo, which Evans sold to an
Australian competitor of the claimants.

When this came to light, Evans argued that he was
hired merely to create point of sale material for use in
the UK: had he known that the logo was for worldwide
use for all purposes, he would have charged more than
his standard rate. Consequently, he argued, he retained
the copyright in the work and any implied term should,
under the Ray v Classic FM66 ‘minimalist approach’, be
limited to a licence to the claimants to use the logo for
point of sale material in the UK, leaving him free to
deal with the copyright as he wished.

The court rejected this argument, describing it as
‘fantastic’.67 On the facts, the reference to ‘UK point of
sale material’ was only ever intended to identify the
work being carried out, not to describe or limit the
rights in it:

If an ofﬁcious bystander had asked at the time of contract
whether Evans was to retain rights in the combined logo,
which could be used against the client by Mr Evans (or
anyone to whom he sold the rights) anywhere in the
world, other than in respect of point of sale material in the
UK, the answer would surely have been ‘of course not’.
Mr Evans had no conceivable further interest in the work
being created—indeed he surely would never have had the
job at all if there had been a debate about this and he had
asserted that that was to be the basis of his work.68

The court also rejected the argument that Evans would
have charged more had he known the intended wider
use of the logo. He had been paid a proper rate and
there was no need for him to retain copyright to call
for payment for further use.

Turning to the application of the Ray v Classic FM69
principles, the court endorsed the conclusion of the
trial judge70 that the creation of a logo was a paradigm
case falling within principle 7 where the court would
be likely to imply a term requiring the assignment of
copyright:

[2003] EWHC 2914 (Peter Prescott QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge).

. . . when a free-lance designer is commissioned to create a
logo for a client, the designer will have an uphill task if he
wishes to contend that he is free to assign the copyright to
a competitor. This is because, in order to give business efﬁ-
cacy to the contract, it will rarely be enough to imply a
term that the client shall enjoy a mere licence to use the
logo, and nothing more. In most cases it will be obvious,
it will ‘go without saying’, that the client will need further
rights. He will surely need some right to prevent others
from reproducing the logo. . . .

It is true that the client may be able to register the logo
as a trade mark, and stop his competitors from using it in
that way. It is also true that the client may, by starting to
use the logo, cause it to acquire recognition in the market,
and hence be in a position to stop his competitors from
imitating his logo, by means of the law of passing off. But
it takes time to register a trade mark and it takes time to
build up market recognition. Further, almost certainly
there will be foreign territories in which the client does not
yet trade, where he may eventually wish to trade, but
where it may take him some time to get established. In
contrast, copyright in the logo comes into existence as
soon as the logo is created.71

The Court of Appeal did not consider whether an
exclusive
judge,
however, noted that such a licence would create practi-
cal difﬁculties without any corresponding beneﬁts:

licence would sufﬁce. The

trial

I have considered whether what should be implied is, not
a right to the copyright, but only a right to an exclusive
licence,
in accordance with the minimalist approach
called for by the authorities . . . I do not think so. It
would have to be a perpetual exclusive licence, which
anyway is almost the same as a straight copyright. One
difference is that Mr Evans would probably have to be
made a party whenever Griggs brought infringement pro-
ceedings against an usurper of the logo: this could hardly
be to his satisfaction. Further, the owner of an exclusive
licence cannot

asylum seekers, hiring Businesslinx (BL) to develop a
web-based database system tailored to their business
practices. As usual in these cases, there was no express
agreement as to ownership of the software. The posi-
tion was further complicated by the fact that the soft-
ware, developed from pre-existing BL software, also
incorporated conﬁdential
information about CSM’s
operating procedures.

At the time of entering into the contract, the soft-
ware was intended for use internally in CSM’s business,
but CSM later decided to resell (by way of sub-licence)
the software to third parties. After BL objected, the
court was asked to decide the respective rights of the
parties in the software.

It was clear that BL retained copyright in its pre-
existing software—but who owned the modiﬁed
package? CSM stressed that
this was a composite
work which embodied its conﬁdential operating pro-
cedures, suggesting an implied obligation to assign the
copyright or an exclusive licence to use the software,
including the right to distribute and sub-licence it. CSM
also argued that the sum paid—£30,000—showed that
an outright transfer of copyright was intended.

BL accepted that CSM was entitled to a licence to use
the software for its own business and was entitled to
protection for its conﬁdential information, but refused
to accept that CSM should be entitled to an assignment
or an exclusive licence, or to sub-licence the software. In
their opinion, CSM could be protected from the misuse
of their conﬁdential
information by a lesser-implied
term—such as a term restricting BL from disclosing that
information. BL also argued that, were CSM to be given
an assignment or exclusive licence, BL could not then
reuse code from that software for other clients. Finally,
BL submitted that sub-licensing of the software by CSM
was not foreseen at the time of the contract, ruling out
any implied term on this point.

The court76 started with the Ray v Classic FM77
principles but noted that, notwithstanding principle 7,
the existence of a composite work did not necessarily
entail an implied obligation to transfer copyright in
every part of that work:

Where it is the case that there is a distinct contribution to
a joint or composite work and it is clear that the parties
would have intended the contractor to be free to use it,
or that they would have been indifferent to such use, an
assignment is not merely unnecessary but is unworkable.78

Similarly, the fact that the software included some con-
ﬁdential
information from CSM did not mean that
CSM thereby obtained exclusivity in the software as a
whole:

[W]here the work is derivative of an earlier work by the
client, such as a sketch given to the contractor to produce
manufacturing drawings, this may be indicative of exclu-
sivity . . . But it by no means follows that whenever the
client has some right in respect of a contribution of a
different nature to the overall project, that the conclusion
will be that he obtains exclusivity in everything produced
within the project.79

The court was also inﬂuenced by the fact that code
reuse was a common and well-known practice in the
software industry, so that the parties must have under-
stood at the time of the contract that code written for
CSM could be reused by BL:

[U]nless there is such a speciﬁc instruction, it is to be
expected that a software developer will both import pre-
existing code into the code he is writing for the client, as
well as export it for other projects.80

Finally, the sum paid for the software was found to be
inconclusive as there was no evidence showing whether
this was a lot or a little for the work done. Accordingly,
the court found that the implied terms in favour of
CSM were limited to a non-exclusive licence to use the
software for its own business, restricting BL from using
information about CSM’s operating procedures for any
other purpose.

The court accepted that, since sub-licensing by CSM
was not in the contemplation of the parties at the time
of the contract, no such term could be implied. Signiﬁ-
cantly, however, the court held that, even if CSM indi-
cated a desire to sub-licence at the time of the contract,
this would not result in an implied term allowing it to
do so without any further payment:

CSM had no clear plan to sell or license the copyright to
anyone. It cannot be described as one of the purposes of
the contract: it was a future but quite distinct business
opportunity requiring further negotiation . . . The evidence
comes miles short of establishing that the parties knew
that CSM would be selling and licensing the software to
others, so that it would be necessary to imply some term
that would permit them to do so.81

Equitable title and moral rights
Even if a commissioner can establish an implied term
granting ownership of copyright,
the moral rights
limit what may be done
of
with the work. Although jurisdictions such as England
and Wales82 do not recognize moral rights in software,
in Ireland (and other jurisdictions such as Canada,
Australia, and Germany) there is no such exclusion.83
In Ireland, the rights created by Part II, Chapter 7
of the CRRA 2000 (notably the paternity and integrity
rights) apply equally to programmers and may limit
what the copyright holder can do with the software.

Even if a commissioner establishes an implied term
granting ownership of copyright, the author’s
moral rights may still limit what may be done
with it

The paternity right grants the programmer the right
to be identiﬁed as the author of the work or any
adaptation of
for
example,
the copyright owner from rebranding the
work as its own without acknowledging the contri-
bution of the programmer.

the work.84 This may prevent,

The integrity right also limits the freedom of the
copyright holder, by giving the programmer a right to
object to ‘any distortion, mutilation or other modiﬁ-
cation of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the
work which would prejudice his or her reputation’.85
This relatively narrow right does not allow a program-
mer to object to changes generally, being limited to
changes which prejudice his reputation.86 However, the
integrity right may nevertheless present problems for
the copyright holder.

For example, suppose that a programmer is commis-
sioned to write e-commerce software which the copy-
right holder later adapts for online gambling or the sale
of pornography. If the programmer has a moral objec-
tion, he might argue that the modiﬁcation of his work

prejudices his reputation by giving the impression that
he condones these activities. Alternatively, a program-
mer who writes a game might argue that a later change
which undermines the gameplay prejudices his repu-
tation for producing enjoyable games. In such cases,
the copyright holder might have to include a disclaimer
in the software specifying that the modiﬁcations are
not attributable to the programmer.87

Can the copyright holder avoid these difﬁculties?
Moral rights, being personal, cannot be assigned or
alienated.88 They can, however, be waived by the
author, in respect of both existing and future works.89
As with assignments of copyright, such waivers should
be in writing and signed by the author.90

Consequently, when dealing with implied assign-
ments or licences in respect of software, we may also
have to ask whether there has been an implied waiver
of the moral rights. This issue arose in Pasterﬁeld v
Denham91 where the plaintiffs were commissioned by
Plymouth City Council to produce leaﬂets and a bro-
chure for a tourist attraction. Their artwork was later
adapted and updated on behalf of
the Council by
another artist. The plaintiffs alleged that this consti-
tuted both an infringement of copyright (which they
alleged they retained) and a violation of their moral
rights in the work.
Judge Overend found that an
implied term that copyright in the work would vest in
the Council, thus defeating the infringement claim. He
then held that the implied term as to copyright did not
automatically carry with it an implied waiver of moral
rights. Considering whether there had been a breach of
the integrity right, he held that the relatively minor
changes made to the plaintiffs’ work did not amount to
the necessary ‘derogatory treatment’.

develop mobile radio systems, asked the developer to
design a printed circuit board (‘PCB’) for its mobile
radio, and in particular to include within that PCB a

the client was using its

The client argued that it was a joint author. It had
produced a detailed speciﬁcation for the software; it
had extensively beta-tested it in its own test facilities,
going through several cycles of testing and re-testing; it
had reported errors and bugs, making suggestions as to
the causes of bugs, and in some cases it had suggested
modiﬁcations which were implemented by the develo-
per or made changes to the parameters and timing
used within the software. The client therefore relied on
Cala Homes (South) Ltd v Alfred McAlpine Homes East
Ltd93 to argue that its input was that of an author not-
withstanding that
it had not written the software.
Laddie J held, however, that:

In relation to authorship, it seems to me that two matters
have to be addressed. First it is necessary to determine
whether the putative author has contributed the right kind
of skill and labour. If he has then it is necessary to decide
whether his contribution was big enough. The latter issue
in particular is a matter of fact and degree.94

The client failed the ﬁrst test, as it had not contributed
the ‘right kind’ of skill and labour. Although the client
as the commissioning party had made contributions
which were ‘extensive and technically sophisticated’,
those were not authorial contributions. Instead, the
client was ‘specifying what the software was to do,
not how it did it’. Similarly, though the client had
worked extensively on beta-testing, Laddie J held that
‘[a]lthough the beta tester may expend skill, time and
effort on testing the software, it is not authorship skill’,
but more akin to that of a proof reader. Therefore the
claim to joint authorship failed, as did the claim to an
implied licence that

97 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of

11 March 1996 on the Legal Protection of Databases.

This decision has since been relied upon in Cyprotex
Discovery Ltd v University of Shefﬁeld95 where a client
who provided program speciﬁcations and background
information and assisted in testing the software was
held not to be a joint author: its involvement was said
to be ‘the work, not of an author of the software, but
of a client who wanted to ensure that the program
when written provided the desired functionality’.96

Database rights
Ownership problems may also arise in respect of data-
base rights. Commissioned software often has its value
not just in the executable code but also in the database
on which the code operates. For example, satellite navi-
gation software depends as much on a database of
street addresses as on its routing algorithms. Similarly,
pharmacy management software may depend on a
database of drugs, manufacturers,
interactions, side
effects, and so on. Such information may not be pro-
tected by copyright, but may beneﬁt from database
right protection under the Database Directive.97 Conse-
quently, it will be vital that the parties agree who will
own the database right.

Without such an agreement, the database right vests
in the maker of the database98—that is, the person
‘who takes the initiative in obtaining, verifying or pre-
senting the contents of
the database and assumes
the risk of investing in that obtaining, veriﬁcation or
presentation’.99 This is different from the ownership of
copyright—the focus is not on authorship but on
initiative, investment, and risk, reﬂecting the economic
rather than creative basis for the right. For that reason,
the Database Directive explicitly excludes subcontrac-
tors from the deﬁnition of ‘maker’.100

It is not clear, however, whether the database right
in commissioned software will vest in the client or the
developer: this may depend on the circumstances of the
individual case. If, for example, a developer is hired on
a time and materials basis, the client is clearly the party
taking the risk of investing in the database and will
hold the database right. In contrast, a ﬁxed price con-
tract may result in the developer being treated as the
party taking the risk, particularly if it was understood
that it might reuse the work in a different context.101

Without
agree by the parties may leave the database right in
limbo.

It is not clear whether the database right
in commissioned software will vest
in the client or in the developer

A further problem arises where the parties do not agree
as to ownership of the database right. In such a case,
there is a real risk of a clash between copyright owner-
ship and database right ownership. As Chalton observes:

When a database is commissioned, there is a possibility
that the author of the database and the commissioner will
be different persons, and their interests may conﬂict.
A contract may resolve the conﬂict, and where it does not
do so equitable principles may vest beneﬁcial ownership of
the author’s copyright in the commissioner: but where
legal and beneﬁcial ownership of the copyright in a data-
base is vested in the database’s author, and database right
is vested in a distinct and different maker, a conﬂict
between their respective interests may arise. The author
will control the copyright restricted acts over the database,
and the maker will control the rights of extraction and
re-utilisation in the same database. This may enable either
party to prevent the other from making commercial use of
the database, unless either or both can rely on lawful user
rights to disable the other’s controls or on some other legal
principle.102

Avoiding the mines
Commissioning software without clearly specifying
what rights are being purchased creates a mineﬁeld for
both the author and the client. The parties should
agree in advance on the extent of the licence or any
assignment of copyright together with the treatment of
database rights and (in relevant jurisdictions) moral
rights. It may also be important to consider IP rights
in works other than the software itself; for example, if
manuals or other materials are necessary for the use of
the software, the contract should specify what rights
subsist in them. Similar issues will arise where other
commissioned works, such as graphics, are to be incor-
porated into software or web pages.

Where the parties fail to agree on rights in the soft-
ware, the extent of any implied term depends on the
facts of the individual case. However, in general the
approach taken by the courts towards such implied
terms appears to favour the author. Although earlier
cases such as John Richardson103 would readily imply
an assignment of copyright in favour of the client,
it seems that in light of the ‘minimalist approach’ of
Ray v Classic FM104 it is now harder for a client to
establish an implied agreement
to assign copyright
rather than a mere licence, which may be personal and
illustrated by Clearsprings105
non-exclusive. This
where the court recognized an industry norm of code
reuse. In the absence of an agreement to the contrary
‘it is to be expected that a software developer will both
import pre-existing code into the code he is writing for
the client, as well as export it for other projects’.106
Paciﬁc Software107 also recognized the norm of code
reuse, making it unlikely that any implied term will
assign copyright or grant exclusivity in respect of
library code. Consequently, even where a client does
succeed in asserting ownership or an exclusive licence
this may well be limited to portions of the code only
(as happened in Clearsprings).

is

The extent of the fee paid for the software will be
relevant but may not be decisive. Although earlier cases
such as Stovin-Bradford108 and Warner109 placed some
emphasis on the amount paid, those cases proceeded
on evidence that there were clear industry norms as to
the rights acquired by clients and the payments appro-
priate for such rights. Clearsprings shows that it may be
difﬁcult to establish such norms in respect of software.
Similarly, Ray v Classic FM110 shows that even a very
substantial fee does not necessarily import ownership
of the commissioned work if the ultimate level of the
fee was not in the contemplation of the parties when
the contract was entered into.

The provision of source code to clients may lead
to an inference that more extensive rights are being
purchased, in particular rights to modify or improve
the software: Saphena Computing v Allied Collection
Agencies.111 Consequently, developers should be cautious
in supplying source code, proceeding only where express
agreement deﬁnes the use that may be made of it.

‘[t]here is no provision for a database made by an agent concerning
work done for a principal to belong to the principal’.

Most importantly, an implied licence will be limited
in its scope to matters which were in the contemplation
of the parties at the time of the contract. This may
create a difﬁculty where a party wishes to use software
for a different purpose or in a new manner. For
example,
if an implied licence were granted in the
context of an application written for a stand-alone
workstation, the client may ﬁnd that the licence does
not permit networked or multi-user use.112 Or an
implied licence might be limited to one geographic or
product area, preventing the client from using or selling
the software elsewhere (compare Ray v Classic FM113
where the database was restricted to use in the UK).

Finally, the areas of moral rights and database rights
can be expected to cause problems if not dealt with in
advance. From the client’s point of view, there is a risk
that, even if copyright is acquired, a developer’s moral
rights may still
its exploitation. Conversely,
given the different criteria for ownership of copyright
and database rights, a developer may ﬁnd that,
although copyright in software is secured, the database
right is vested in the client, limiting opportunities to
develop the software further.
