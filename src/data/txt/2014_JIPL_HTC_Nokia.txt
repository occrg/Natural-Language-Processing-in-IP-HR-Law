quences which ﬂowed from this decision and, in particular,
whether Nokia could secure an injunction?

To some extent, Virgin were fortunate that, having said
they would withdraw the designation of the UK for the
’908 patent but paying the designation fee, they got away
with ‘double patenting’ (ie, having a national patent and
EP (UK)). Yet it was not infringed, and the defendants
know clearly how to avoid infringement. Virgin may have
got lucky, but it did not do them any good.

B HTC v Nokia: In the United Kingdom will
an injunction be granted following a ﬁnding
of patent infringement?

HTC Corporation v Nokia Corporation [2013] EWHC 3778
(Pat), Patents Court, England and Wales, 3 December 2013
In this action Mr Justice Arnold granted a ﬁnal injunc-
tion restraining HTC from continuing to sell products
which he had previously determined infringed Nokia’s
patent. In doing so, he clariﬁed the test to be applied
when considering whether to grant a ﬁnal injunction in
patent cases.

Legal context
In May 2013 the author co-authored a paper (R Lundie-
Smith and G Moss ‘Bard v Gore: to injunct, or not to
injunct, what is the question? Is it right to reward an infrin-
ger for successfully exploiting a patent?’ (2013) 8(5) JIPLP
359) analysing the differences in approaches of the courts
in the United States and the United Kingdom as to the
grant of ﬁnal injunctions in patent infringement cases. In
particular, we drew attention to the fact that, following the
decision of the US Supreme Court in eBay Inc v MercEx-
change, LLC, 547 US 388 (2006), the US courts had adopted
a ‘balance of harm’ approach, whereas in the UK the ap-
proach still appeared to be that the claimant was entitled to
an injunction unless the harm inﬂicted on the defendant by
the grant of the injunction would be ‘grossly dispropor-
tionate’ to the continuing damage likely to be suffered by
the patentee.

Further opportunity to assess the approach of the UK
courts to this issue arose in HTC v Nokia. This followed the
decision by Arnold J in October 2013 that HTC had
infringed Nokia’s European Patent (UK) No. 0,998,024 (the
‘024 patent) and that the patent was valid. The question
which arose in the subsequent hearing was as to the conse-

Facts
An important aspect of the ‘024 patent was that it had not
been declared essential to any telecoms standard. This
meant that there had not been the usual fair, reasonable,
and non-discriminatory (FRAND) undertaking in respect
of this patent, and HTC could not avail itself of the defence
that Nokia would have been obliged to grant it a licence
under the patent had HTC been a willing licensee.

HTC nevertheless argued that, even though it had been
found to be infringing Nokia’s valid patent, Nokia’s remedy
should lie in damages alone. HTC relied inter alia on the
following factors which, it said were present:

(i) the patented element formed only a small part of the

overall commercial device;

(ii) the royalties were likely to be small;

(iii) Nokia was ‘only interested in money’ since it had
licensed its patents to others and was on the verge of
selling its handset business to Microsoft;

(iv) Nokia had already granted licences to Apple and RIM
and, according to HTC, Google, Samsung and LG
were also infringing, but Nokia had not taken action
to restrain their activities; and

(v) the grant of an injunction would have a dispropor-
tionately adverse impact on HTC given that the in-
junction would apply to its best-selling HTC One
telephone.

All of which cut very little ice with the Arnold J. One
matter which exercised him in particular was that
it
appeared that alternative, non-infringing solutions were
available to HTC, but that HTC had not taken contingency
steps to ensure that such alternatives could be implemented
immediately, notwithstanding the fact that it had known
since 2011 that Nokia was of the view that HTC’s chips
infringed a number of Nokia’s non-standard essential
patents.

Analysis
The UK law on whether an injunction will be granted fol-
lowing a successful ﬁnding of infringement derives from
the decision in Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co
(1895) 1 Ch 287. In that case, A L Smith LJ stated that ‘it
was a good working rule’ that damages could be given in
substitution for an injunction:

1. if the injury to the plaintiff ’s legal rights is small,

2. it is one which is capable of being estimated in money,

3. it is one which can be adequately compensated by a

small money payment, and

4. the case is one in which it would be oppressive to the

defendant to grant an injunction.

show that the injunction would be disproportionate is a
heavy one.

Absent such factors, the claimant was entitled to the
injunction.

In Navitaire Inc v EasyJet Airline Co Ltd (No 2) [2004]
EWHC 2271 (Ch) Pumfrey J said that he understood the
use of the word ‘oppressive’ in A L Smith LJ’s formulation
to mean that the grant of the injunction had to be ‘grossly
disproportionate’ to the right protected. Pumfrey J’s inter-
pretation was cited with approval by Jacob LJ in Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd v Premium Aircraft Interiors UK Ltd
[2011] EWCA Civ 163.

However, commentators have queried how this sits with
Article 3(2) of Directive 2004/48 on the enforcement of
intellectual property rights which provides that remedies
shall be:

. . . effective, proportionate and dissuasive and shall be
applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers
to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against
their abuse.

The question raised was, how does one square the circle
between something which is not ‘grossly disproportionate’
and something which is ‘proportionate’? Theoretically,
each should be the mirror image of the other, but in that
case what does the word ‘grossly’ add?

Arnold J stated that in his view the time had come to rec-
ognize that, in cases concerning infringement of intellectual
property rights, the criteria to be applied when deciding
whether or not to grant an injunction are those laid down
by Article 3(2) of the Enforcement Directive. However, he
also pointed out that the provisions of the Agreement on
Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
dealing with compulsory licences were of relevance in this
context, since the effect of refusing an injunction following a
ﬁnding of infringement was de facto the grant of a compul-
sory licence to the infringer. Article 30 of TRIPS provides
that although Member States can provide limited exceptions
to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, such exceptions
should not unreasonably conﬂict with the normal exploit-
ation of the patent or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate
rights of the patent owner.

Arnold J concluded thus:

I consider that Article 3(2) of the Enforcement Directive
permits and requires the court to refuse to grant an injunc-
tion where it would be disproportionate to grant one even
having regard to the requirements of efﬁcacy and dissuasive-
ness. Where the right sought to be enforced by the injunc-
tion is a patent, however, the court must be very cautious
before making an order which is tantamount to a compul-
sory licence in circumstances where no compulsory licence
would be available. It follows that, where no other counter-
vailing right is in play, the burden on the party seeking to

Arnold J ended by commenting that he suspected that the
practical effect of his conclusion was little different from
the ‘grossly disproportionate’ test of Pumfrey J.

Applying these conclusions to the case before him, he
decided that an injunction should be granted. Nevertheless,
there was some relief for HTC in that, although he granted
the injunction, he also stayed its implementation in respect
of HTC’s main product, the One, pending its appeal
against his substantive ﬁndings on validity and infringe-
ment.

Practical signiﬁcance
This case highlights that in the UK it is still the ‘norm’ that,
following a ﬁnding of patent infringement, the presump-
tion is in favour of the grant of an injunction. This is
primarily due to the very nature of the right granted, ie a
right to exclude all others from working the invention, and
the fact that the injunction is the primary way of enforcing
that right. That is not to say that injunctions follow auto-
matically; each case will turn on its own facts. But, as
Arnold J said, the burden on the party seeking to show that
the grant of the injunction would be disproportionate is a
heavy one.

Contrast this with the position in the USA where, follow-
ing eBay, the question of whether or not a ﬁnal injunction
will be granted now appears to turn on the balance of equi-
ties. Moreover, as highlighted in our earlier paper, the US
courts have not shied away from granting what is tanta-
mount to compulsory licences and awarding ongoing roy-
alties.

In the discussions regarding the Rules of Procedure for
the Uniﬁed Patents Court, some commentators have sug-
gested that when dealing with the power to grant injunc-
tions there should be included so called ‘eBay’ provisions.
By that is meant rules speciﬁcally providing that the
court can only grant an injunction if the case satisﬁes the
proportionality test. However, as this case graphically
demonstrates, the European law on ‘proportionality’ in
this area is signiﬁcantly different from the test laid down
by the US Supreme Court in eBay. To conﬂate the two
approaches
risks weakening the current protections
enjoyed by patent owners in Europe and would be tanta-
mount to enacting a change in the substantive law via the
back door.
