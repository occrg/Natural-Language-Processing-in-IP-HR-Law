Recognizing that section 271(f) does not deﬁne the
word ‘supplied’, the court sought to determine the term’s
‘ordinary, contemporary, common meaning’. The court
concluded that such a meaning cannot be determined
without considering the nature and business practices of
the particular technology involved. The court characterized
copying as ‘part and parcel’ of software distribution/supply
due to the replicable nature of software. Viewed in this
context, all copies of software replicated abroad from a
US version, whether sent on a disk or via electronic trans-
mission, are ‘supplied’ from the United States for purposes
of section 271(f). To accept Microsoft’s suggestion that
section 271(f) liability should extend, at most, to each
disk shipped from the United States for incorporation
into a foreign-assembled computer would be to disregard
the technological realities of the software industry and
render section 271(f) ineffective for this particular ﬁeld of
technology.

‘supplying from the US’, noting that

In dissent, Judge Rader took issue with the majority’s
conclusion that extraterritorial copying constitutes an
act of
foreign
copying of a tangible product supplied from the United
States (eg a key component of a patented lock product)
would not appear to create separate liability for each
copy made and sold abroad. In Judge Rader’s view, the
majority improperly gives extraterritorial effect to US law
by creating liability for the activities of foreign manufac-
turers.

Practical significance
With its recent decisions in AT&T v Microsoft Corp, Eolas
Techs Inc v Microsoft Corp, and Union Carbide Chem &
Plastics Tech Corp v Shell Oil Co Case 04-1475 (Fed Cir
3 October 2005) (holding that exporting a catalyst from
the United States for use abroad in a patented process gives
rise to section 271(f) liability), the Federal Circuit has
taken an expansive view of 35 USC section 271(f). These
decisions, however, should be contrasted with the more
restrained view demonstrated in Pellegrini v Analog
Devices, Inc, 375 F 3d 113 (Fed Cir 2004). In Pellegrini,
the court declined to interpret section 271(f) as covering
acts of providing instructions and oversight
from the
United States for manufacturing integrated circuits com-
ponents abroad because the components in question
(ie the integrated circuits) were never physically present
in the United States.

Numerous industry-speciﬁc business models for inter-
national product development, manufacturing, and supply
exist along the spectrum between Pellegrini (providing
US oversight of foreign integrated circuit manufacturing)
and AT&T (providing software from the United States
for copying abroad). It remains to be seen whether the
‘industry-speciﬁc’ application of section 271(f) expressed

in AT&T v Microsoft Corp will provide extraterritorial
protection for US patentees in other technological ﬁelds
where replication is a common business practice.

& Supplementary protection
certificates: Advocate General’s
opinion on formulations
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s SPC Application
(C-431/04) opinion of AG, 24 November 2005 (unreported)

The opinion of Advocate General Le´ger, published on 24
November 2005 in C-431/04, opens the way for extend-
ing the duration of certain pharmaceutical formulation
patents by means of a supplementary protection certiﬁ-
cate (SPC).

Legal context
Supplementary protection certiﬁcates (SPCs) are intended
to compensate pharmaceutical companies for the loss of
effective patent term caused by the delay in getting regula-
tory approval. With the SPC, the patent owner is able to
enjoy up to 15 years of marketing exclusivity for the drug
substance, from the date of the ﬁrst marketing author-
ization in the European Economic Area (EEA), subject
to a 5 year cap on the duration of the SPC. The SPC
Regulation, 1768/92, also makes it possible to get SPCs
for the combinations of active ingredients. Combinations
that have beneﬁted from SPCs include combinations of
ACE inhibitors and diuretics for the treatment of hyper-
tension and the combination of a bronchodilator and a
steroid for the treatment of asthma. Generally it is under-
stood that the Regulation requires that each component
of the combination is a drug substance.

Facts
The case on which AG Le´ger has given his opinion con-
cerns the medicinal product Gliadel Implant, which con-
sists of a drug substance carmustine and a polymeric
biologically degradable excipient polifeprosan. Gliadel has
been approved for marketing in a number of EU states,
including France, UK, and Germany. However, this was
not the ﬁrst medicinal product to include carmustine,
which was ﬁrst authorized as the active ingredient of a
medicinal product in the EEA in March 1979.

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2006, Vol. 1, No. 4

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is the pro-
prietor of a patent, EP 260 415, which claims this formula-
tion. The earlier authorization of carmustine prevented
MIT from getting an SPC relating to carmustine itself.
In any event, the basic patent for this drug substance
had expired. The normal expiry date of the ‘415 patent’
was
July 2007—an SPC would give protection until
July 2012.

Following the authorization of Gliadel during 1999, MIT
ﬁled SPC applications in France, UK, and Germany, on the
basis that the product represented carmustine in combina-
tion with polifeprosan. This was accepted by both the UK
and French patent ofﬁces. However, the German patent
ofﬁce rejected the application, on the grounds that polife-
prosan is not an active ingredient—it is only an excipient
itself have any therapeutic activity.
which does not
Following an appeal,
the German Bundesgerichtshof
observed that requiring all components to be therapeuti-
cally active ingredients would give the Regulation a limited
applicability and would exclude from SPC protection
new drug formulations that had been the subject of
extensive research. This position appears contrary to the
explanatory memorandum of the European Commission
in support of the Regulation. According to this, all phar-
maceutical research, whether it concerns a new product,
a new process for obtaining a new or known product, a
new application of a product, or a new combination of
substances containing a new or known product, must be
encouraged.

An alternative approach was taken by the UK patent
ofﬁce which took to view that, if the combination results
in a new medicinal product in which the therapeutic
effects of the drug substance are deﬁned and controlled
by the excipient, an SPC should be granted.

In the light of these considerations, the Bundesgericht-
shof decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the
following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:

1. Does the concept of ‘combination of active ingredients
of a medicinal product’ within the meaning of
Article 1(b) of Regulation 1768/92 mean that
the
components of the combination must all be active
ingredients with a therapeutic effect?

2. Is there a ‘combination of active ingredients of a medic-
inal product’ also where a combination of substances
comprises two components of which one component
is a known substance with a therapeutic effect for a spe-
cific indication and the other component renders possi-
ble a pharmaceutical form of the medicinal product that
brings about a changed efficacy of the medicinal prod-
uct for this indication (in vivo implantation with con-
trolled release of the active ingredient to avoid toxic
effects)?

Analysis
By recommending that the concept of combination pro-
ducts should be interpreted so as not to preclude from
SPC protection a combination of two substances, one of
which is a known drug substance and the other is necessary
for the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the drug substance, AG Le´ger
reviewed at length the objectives of the SPC Regulation.

He noted that the broad logic of the SPC Regulation
suggested that a certiﬁcate should be granted for combina-
tions if all the other conditions of application are satisﬁed.
The combination (formulation) at issue had not previously
been granted an SPC and the authorization to place Gliadel
on the market was ﬁrst granted by the German authorities.
As far as the objectives of Regulation were concerned, the
objective of continuing the improvement in public health
requires sufﬁcient legal protection to be granted to innova-
tions that allow therapeutic efﬁcacy of active substances to
be increased.

He considered that research into new applications for
existing active ingredients should be promoted by develop-
ing auxiliary substances enabling their use or enhancement
of their pharmacological properties for a speciﬁc therapeu-
tic indication. This would be of beneﬁt to patients as it
would lead to improved medicines.

He noted that it was clear that an SPC could not be
granted every time that a known drug substance, eg aspirin,
is reformulated. However, SPCs should be available where
the combination at
issue represents a major innova-
tion, resulting from long, costly research which the SPC
Regulation precisely seeks to protect.

Speciﬁcally the Advocate General believed that where
the effective treatment of certain illnesses requires an active
ingredient to be combined with a substance which, while
not having any pharmacological properties of its own,
allows the biologically active substance effectively to release
its therapeutic effects the combination must fall within
the scope of ‘combination of active ingredients of a medic-
inal product’ within the meaning of the Article 1(b) of the
SPC Regulation 1768/92. It is therefore the necessity of the
excipient to ensure the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the active
ingredient that must be the determining factor in ascer-
taining whether a combination of these two substances
is covered by ‘combination of active ingredients of a
medicinal product’.

Although he acknowledged that this might give national
patent ofﬁces some problems of interpretation, he did not
feel
the
situations.

this called into question his analysis of

that

He noted that the grant of an SPC requires an examina-
tion not only of the basic patent, but also of the marketing
authorization. Thus,
the description contained in the
basic patent makes it possible to disclose the invention
claimed and the advantageous effects of the invention

with reference to the background art. The marketing
authorization must contain information with a high level
of precision on the characteristics of the medicinal product
and its constituents, on its pharmaceutical qualities, and
on its therapeutic efﬁcacy.

He added that, although there was a risk that the
national patent ofﬁces might adopt different assessments
in applying the criterion of the ‘necessity of the excipient’,
he considered that the risk was inherent in the procedure
for the grant of the SPC itself.

Practical significance
It remains to be seen whether the ECJ will follow AG’s
Le´ger’s opinion—a decision could be given in the ﬁrst
quarter of this year. If the ECJ follows the opinion, those
active ingredients, reformulated as liposomes, in polymer
matrices or with other excipients which change the way
in which the active substance can be used will in certain
cases be eligible for SPC protection. That result would be
welcomed by the pharmaceutical
industry at the time
when it would seem to be increasingly difﬁcult for compa-
nies to invent new active substances, while attempts to
prolong positions of market exclusivity by regulatory
means would have failed.

The analysis by the Advocate General is consistent with
the approach that used to be taken for such combina-
tions/formulations by the UK patent ofﬁce. Recently it
appeared that they were about to change their approach.
Indeed the UK patent ofﬁce has also referred a similar
matter to the MIT case to the ECJ (C-202/05).

AG Le´ger’s opinion should encourage those with patents
relating to pharmaceutical products which get to the mar-
ket as a result of long and costly research to patent holders
beginning to apply for an SPC, which they must do within
6 months of receiving the marketing authorization.

Trade marks

& OHIM Board of Appeal applies
genuine use criteria to small-scale
usage
Paul Reber GmbH & Co KG v Mars
Incorporated,
AL SULTANA/Sultana, OHIM First Board of Appeal,
R 1101/2004-1, 22 September 2004

This decision illustrates
the
European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling in Ansul v Ajax

consequences of

the

[2003] ETMR 85 that, in establishing whether there has
been genuine use of the mark on the market, the condi-
tions prevalent in the market for which the goods are
registered must be taken into account.

Legal context
Where an application to register a Community trade mark
(CTM) is opposed by the owner of an earlier mark, the
applicant for the CTM can request under Article 43(2) of
Regulation 40/94 that the opponent proves that he has
made genuine use of his mark in the Community in
respect of the goods or services for which it is registered.
If the opponent cannot prove that he has so used his
mark, the opposition is rejected.

The ECJ has ruled on the meaning of genuine use in the
analogous situation of use for the purpose of avoiding
revocation of a trade mark under Article 12(1) of Directive
89/104. In Ansul v Ajax [2003] ETMR 85 the court stated
that genuine use of a trade mark occurs where the mark
is used in accordance with its essential function, which
is to guarantee the identity of the origin of the goods or
services for which it is registered, in order to create or
preserve an outlet for those goods or services.
‘Token
use’ (sham use that takes place merely to preserve the
registration of the trade mark) was judged insufﬁcient to
meet that deﬁnition. However,
in judging whether the
use is genuine, all relevant circumstances must be taken
into account. Such circumstances include the nature of
the goods or services at issue, the characteristics of the
market concerned, and the scale and frequency of use of
the mark. As a result of such considerations, the use of a
mark need not always be quantitatively signiﬁcant for it
to be considered genuine and in markets where a low
turnover is normal, a low level of usage may be considered
to be genuine use. The issue of small-scale use has
subsequently been considered by the England and Wales
Court of Appeal
in Laboratoires Goemar v La Mer
Technology [2005] ETMR 114 (CA), which, in the light of
Ansul v Ajax, rejected the idea of a ﬁxed quantitative or
qualitative measure of genuine use.

Facts
Mars applied to register the word mark AL SULTANA as a
CTM for various goods in Class 30. Reber opposed
the application under Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation 40/94,
citing its earlier German SULTANA trade mark, registered
in Class 30 for biscuits, cake, and confectionery. Mars
required Reber to prove that it had used the mark under
Article 43 CTMR. Reber responded that it owned a confec-
tionery store in the city of Bad Reichenhall, Germany,
where it had sold between 65 and 72 kg of the chocolates
over the counter under the mark each year during the
years 1998–2001. The chocolates were hand-made pralines
which were sold unpackaged on trays for immediate
