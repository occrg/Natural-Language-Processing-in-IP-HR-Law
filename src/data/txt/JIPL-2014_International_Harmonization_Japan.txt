International harmonization of the grace period:
the experience of Japan
Shohei Ishimaru and Yuichiro Nakaya*

Background
The discussion on the harmonization of patent systems
started in 1985 at the World Intellectual Property Organ-
ization (WIPO). Although the discussion on harmoniz-
ing substantive patent law has been stagnant in recent
years, it was revived after the America Invents Act (AIA),
enacted in 2011.

One of the forums for these discussions is the Tegernsee
Group.1 Responding to the results of the third meeting in
October 2012, the Japan Patent Ofﬁce (JPO) hosted sympo-
siums in Tokyo and Osaka,2 and found that harmonization
of the grace period (GP) is the most strongly expected
anticipated outcome on the part of users (see Figure 1).
Further, in such discussions, the grace period attracts a lot
of attention in international user communities.3

A grace period is a period of time before the date of
ﬁling a patent application for an invention during which
certain kinds of disclosure of the invention are deemed
not to destroy the novelty of the invention. Disclosures
of this nature are usually referred to as ‘non-prejudicial
disclosures’. The Cohen-Boyer patents are the best
known case of patents utilizing GP;4 it is said that these
patents have generated about 250 million dollars.

With regard to GP, the Patent Act was revised in 2011
in Japan. This article introduces statistical data relating to
patent applications invoking GP received by the JPO, and
examines the harmonization of GP by presenting the
authors’ experiences. We were able to access a variety of
data from related departments of the JPO when writing
this article, and we would like to express our sincere grati-
tude to all parties that facilitated our research.

systems at WIPO started in 1985, the Prior Meeting on

† With regard to the grace period (GP), the Patent
Act was revised in 2011 in Japan in order to
permit broad invocation of the GP to the disclos-
ure resulting from an act of the person having the
right to obtain a patent (including secondary dis-
closure). The revised Patent Act came into force
in April 2012.

† This article introduces statistical data of patent
applications invoking the GP, received by the
Japan Patent Ofﬁce (JPO) between April and De-
cember 2012, in order to ﬁnd out what changes
are occurring due to the revision of the Patent Act
in Japan in 2011. The data provided here imply
that the revised GP system relieved more appli-
cants than ever by enabling them to ﬁle patent
applications invoking the GP under various situa-
tions, including cases when applicants were not
only universities but also small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and large companies.

† In July 2012 the JPO conducted a questionnaire
survey on the results of the Patent Act revision.
According to the results of this questionnaire
survey, we found out that most of the respondents
approved of the expanded scope of the GP. In
addition, we examine the harmonization of GP by
introducing the roundtables on the harmoniza-
tion of patent systems held in Japan.

made to undertake a detailed study of four issues, and the
study reports were made available on the discussants’ web-
sites. After the third meeting held in Geneva in October
2012, the Tegernsee Group undertook a common question-
naire survey and held roundtables. Currently, the Group is
summarizing the results of the surveys and roundtables.

Differences in grace period systems
Below we outline the differences between the systems of
individual countries and regions. Table 1 does not pre-
cisely reﬂect phrases used in the patent legislation of in-
dividual countries and regions, but has simpliﬁed them.
This allows us to understand in a concise manner the
differences among the different countries and regions.

With regard to the scope of the GP, in Japan, the Re-
public of Korea and the United States, inventors/appli-
cants can invoke the GP regardless of the format in which
they disclose their inventions. In Europe, however, the
disclosure format is very limited. Although the GP in
Europe may be used if inventions are disclosed at inter-
national exhibitions, there are only three exhibitions7 that
have currently been approved. In China, the scope of the
GP is slightly broader than that of Europe, as disclosures
at speciﬁed academic conferences are allowed, in addition
to international exhibitions.

With regard to disclosures by third parties, the GP may
be used for secondary disclosures by third parties origin-
ating from disclosures by inventors/applicants in Japan,
the Republic of Korea and the United States, but not in
China and Europe. Notably the GP may be applied to dis-
closures by third parties in the United States, even in cases
where a third party independently makes and discloses
the invention. This means that if any person discloses an
invention ﬁrst, a patent right will be granted to him/her
no matter who discloses it later (during 12 months).
Therefore, some point out that the United States has actu-
ally changed from the ﬁrst-to-invent system to the ‘ﬁrst-
to-publish system.’ It will be necessary to keep an eye on
how this system, unique to the United States, is enforced
and what impact it will have.

As shown in the Table 1, there is a difference in terms of
the duration of the GP: 12 months in the United States and
the Republic of Korea, but 6 months elsewhere. In terms of
the date from which the GP is calculated, some countries
base it on the ﬁling date, but others (China and the United
States) base it on either the ﬁling date or the priority date.

Figure 1. Importance of harmonization: Answers from Audience
of Symposiums held by JPO in Tokyo and Osaka in March 2013.
Note: Figure 1 shows the number of responses.

Grace Period was held in 1984.5 This indicates that GP
has been recognized as an important item for the process
of harmonization from the very beginning of the discus-
sions on patent harmonization.

Although a diplomatic conference held to adopt the
Patent Harmonization Treaty in 1991 was unsuccessful,
WIPO continued the discussions, and in 2000, enacted the
Patent Law Treaty (PLT) adopted. WIPO then resumed
the discussion of substantive patent harmonization which
was intended to lead to the Substantive Patent Law Treaty,
but which, in 2005, resulted in a stalemate over North–
South issues. In response to this stalemate, the Meeting of
Developed Countries (the so-called ‘Group Bþ’) was set
up to discuss the subject, but faced a conﬂict of opinions
among member countries; there has been no signiﬁcant
progress in its discussions after 2008.

However, the United States’ progress toward the AIA
in 2011 had a signiﬁcant impact on those international
discussions and produced new momentum, one aspect
of which was the onset of discussions in the Meeting of
Five IP Ofﬁces; another was the initiation of discussions
in the Tegernsee Group.

The Meeting of Five IP Ofﬁces is a framework estab-
lished by ﬁve patent ofﬁces6 in 2007. The Five IP Heads
Meeting held in Tokyo in June 2011 resolved to begin
discussing patent harmonization, and since then the
group has made a comparative study of the operation of
patent systems in individual countries and regions.

Just after the start of discussions among the Five IP
Ofﬁces, the Tegernsee Group commenced its own discus-
sion. Its ﬁrst meeting was held in Tegernsee, a suburb of
Munich, in July 2011. At the second Tegernsee Meeting
(Spitzingsee, Germany) held in April 2012, a decision was

Furthermore, some countries require a declaration or
prescribed procedures in order to use the GP at the time
of ﬁling of a patent application. While the United States
does not require any declaration, s 1.77 of the Rules of
Practice (Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 37)) of the
AIA announced on 14 February 2013, stipulates that the
speciﬁcation should include a statement referencing prior
disclosures by the inventor or the joint inventor.

The columns for Europe in Table 1 are based on the
European Patent Convention (EPC). The EPC member
states base their GPs on the provisions of the EPC, except
Portugal (where presentations at academic conferences
are subject to GP). A point of interest is that Germany
still permits GP without any restriction on disclosures by
inventors/applicants in the case of utility models. Indeed,
Germany had GP in its previous patent legislation, as did
Austria, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
However, GP was excluded from each country’s Patent
Act when they joined the EPC.

Lastly, when we will look at other countries:8 Australia
and Canada have generous GPs, as do Brazil and Russia.
In India, the GP can be used for disclosures at academic
conferences and tests at public places other than at exhi-
bitions and fairs.

Revision of Japan’s Patent Act in 2011
In the case of the GP in Japan, there is currently no re-
striction on the formats of disclosures by applicants, as
explained above. This is the same as in the United States.

But it was not always so. According the pre-1959 Patent
Act, the GP could be used only for disclosures made at
tests and at fairs and for exhibitions that had been
approved by the government.

Presentations in printed publications and in writing
at academic conferences designated by the Commission-
er of the Japan Patent Ofﬁce were added to the scope of
the GP when the Patent Act was revised in 1959, in re-
sponse to requests from academic societies. Disclosures
via the internet were added to the scope of the GP in
1999, and the previously limited list of approved disclos-
ure formats was augmented in 2011 when Patent Act
Article 30 was revised.

We would like to describe the 2011 Patent Act Revision
in more detail.9 In the past, the GP could only be used for
a limited number of disclosure formats. However, it was
pointed out that such narrowly delimited scope did not
make the GP very meaningful, particularly since the list
did not include ‘marketing research conducted for busi-
ness purposes’ or ‘sales’. Then there were cases in which
similar types of disclosures were allowed in some cases
but not in others, on account of the different disclosure
formats, methods and media, which created an inconsist-
ent system.

Examples of inconsistency:

† Disclosure of

inventions

through catalogues and
pamphlets displaying one’s own products to unspeci-
ﬁed persons was allowed under the scope of the GP,
while disclosure by selling one’s own products was not.

conferences

Moreover, it was pointed out that there were inconsist-
encies when it came to disclosure through written pre-
sentations
sponsored by
academic societies because the GP did not apply where
an academic society had not been designated by the
Commissioner of the Japan Patent Ofﬁce.10 In contrast,
written proceedings and presentations posted on the
internet may be subject to GP regardless of whether
there is such a designation.

In order to eliminate such inconsistencies in the GP,
its scope was broadened to include any formats chosen
by the applicants to disclose their inventions so they may
become publicly known. This signiﬁcant expansion of
the scope of the GP coincided with the demand from
universities while enhancing the convenience for users
who are not familiar with the patent system, taking into
account the current situation in which research activities
have become increasingly diversiﬁed in line with the pro-
gress of open innovation. This is thought to expand the
base for creating innovation. The list below summarizes
the effect of the 2011 revision:
† A person having the right to obtain a patent either
conducted a test or made a presentation in a printed
publication, in the media or in writing at an academic
conference designated by the Commissioner of the
Japan Patent Ofﬁce.
† A person having the right to obtain a patent has either
disclosed the invention through an exhibition spon-
sored by the government or at an exhibition designated
by the Commissioner of the Japan Patent Ofﬁce.
† The disclosure was made against the will of the

the right to obtain a patent.

The current, post-revision situation
Since the revised GP system came into force in April
2012, the JPO has kept an eye on the situation and has

10 It had been provided that academic societies shall be designated by the
Commissioner of the Japan Patent Ofﬁce. Therefore, the existence of an
application by an organizer affected the approval of whether the provision
of exception to lack of novelty applies. No foreign academic society has

provided us with data in this regard. Here we comment
on that data.

Statistics on the use of the GP
In Japan, any applicant who invokes a GP needs to
submit a document indicating his/her intention at the
moment of ﬁling the patent application, and must
submit necessary information for invoking it (ie indicate
when and where the disclosure was made and what was
disclosed by whom) within 30 days from the ﬁling of the
patent application. Currently, we have data up until
December 2012 because of the delay needed to compile
the data.

Figure 2 shows estimated values for the period from
April 2012 to March 2013 based on data collected
between April and December 2012. According to these
estimated values, the use of GP increased by 66 per cent
after the revised system had gone into effect.

Currently, the JPO receives approximately 340,000
applications per year, with the GP being used in fewer
than 1 per cent of the total ﬁlings.

level

same

The use of the GP decreased by approximately 20 per
cent between 2009 and 2011. There are several reasons
for this decrease. One reason is that the number of
patent applications ﬁled by universities and small-and-
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) had decreased. The
number of patent applications that the JPO received
remained around the
(approximately
340,000) between 2009 and 2011 on a calendar year basis
(in 2009 there were 348,596; in 2010 there were 344,598;
and in 2011 there were 342,610). During those years, the
number of applications ﬁled by universities decreased by
5 per cent on a calendar year basis. The number in 2009
was 7151, while the number in 2011 was 6756. Applica-
tions ﬁled by SMEs decreased 10 per cent from 34,667 in
2009 to 31,068 in 2011. Referring to the data below, we
will explain that more than half of GP users are univer-
sities and SMEs. The decreasing number of patent appli-
cations ﬁled by universities and SMEs is thus considered
to be a factor contributing to the decrease in the number
of GP uses. However, the 20 per cent decrease in the GP
usage cannot be explained by that reason alone.

Another plausible reason is that intellectual property
management has become widely recognized. National
universities, which account for a high percentage of
patent applications ﬁled by universities, were incorpo-
rated in April 2004. Along with this change, the conven-
tional principle, which was that research achievements

made an application, although they could have been designated in terms of
the system. A presentation made by a foreign academic society was not
subject to GP.

products before they ﬁle patent applications for them,
and ﬁle patent applications only after they had come to
know that those products are popular among costumers.
As a result, they cannot take advantage of GP when they
are ﬁling their patent applications.

In many cases, as mentioned above, SMEs, without
sufﬁcient resources to develop intellectual property sec-
tions, realize the necessity of ﬁling patent applications
after it has become too late. The revised patent law can
now eliminate such cases.

The use of GP by large companies has doubled. Gener-
ally, large companies rarely use GP. The rate of GP utiliza-
tion is no more than a few cases per 1000. Although large
companies manage their inventions in a well-organized
manner, they do not always manage them perfectly. In ex-
tremely rare cases, due to an error, they disclose their
inventions before they have ﬁled patent applications, and
this forces them to use the GP. That is to say, the revision
of the Patent Act offers the possibility of relieving such
emergency situations.

On the other hand, with regard to applications ﬁled
by universities and public research institutions, the use
of GP has not increased signiﬁcantly, even in the case of
joint applications. The use has increased by only 18 per
cent, from 590 applications in 2011 to 700 applications
in 2012, and this increase is low compared to the entire
increase.

It seems that the following are the reasons for this. Ap-
proximately 70 per cent of the use of GP by universities
and public research institutions is connected to presenta-
tions at academic conferences hosted by academic soci-
eties. Although only academic societies designated by the
Commissioner of the Japan Patent Ofﬁce were eligible
under the previous Patent Act, the number of societies
designated by the Commissioner exceeded 1000 (all desig-
nated academic societies were Japanese academic soci-
eties).11 It is thus assumed that almost all academic
societies in Japan were designated by the Commissioner of
the Japan Patent Ofﬁce, and that almost all presentations
made at academic conferences held in Japan were eligible
for GP. We can say that the condition of being ‘desig-
nat[ed] by the Commissioner of the Japan Patent Ofﬁce’
was removed by the revision of the Patent Act, but in prac-
tice the scope of GP was not expanded in terms of such
presentations (presentations at overseas academic confer-
ences became eligible for GP). While some applications
ﬁled after April 2012 contained requests for the use of GP
in presentations at overseas academic conferences.

were generally vested in the individual researchers, was
changed so that achievements are now vested in the
organizations themselves. Therefore, given the necessity
to manage intellectual property vested in them, each
university has set up intellectual property headquarters
and has made greater efforts to provide education on in-
tellectual property to the teaching staff. The decrease in
the number of applications using the GP may be partly a
result of these changes. As if testifying to this, a panellist
at the symposium stated: ‘Taking all applications ﬁled in
the past into consideration, 14% of them had used the
GP. However, recently only 5% of applications used the
GP in the past few years.’

Change in breakdown of GP users
Table 2 below compares the breakdown of GP users from
April to December 2011 and the breakdown from April
to December 2012.

Analysis by sector of applicant
We note that the use of GP by SMEs increased approxi-
mately 3.5 times, from 120 to 417 instances. According
to the parties concerned, many applications are ﬁled
because ‘exhibitions/fairs’ no longer need to be approved
by the Commissioner, and ‘the act of selling’ has been
included in the scope of GP under the revised patent
law. A panellist at the symposium held in Tokyo stated:

Currently, we notice that SMEs cannot fully manage intel-
lectual property because they do not have intellectual prop-
erty departments. It is common for companies with 200
employees to have at most one dedicated intellectual prop-
erty staff and two concurrent staff.

Another panellist commented that there have been
cases in which SMEs and venture companies supply

Table 2 Change in the number of applications for exception to lack of novelty (by sector of applicant and type of
disclosure)

Statistical Survey on GP (JPO, March 2013).

In fact, the use of GP for disclosures at exhibitions
and fairs has increased signiﬁcantly, as their designation
by the Commissioner has become unnecessary. To begin
with, it used to be necessary to obtain designation every
time an exhibition or fair was held, even if it was regular-
ly held every year. In addition, only about 120 exhibi-
tions held in 2011 were so designated.12 For example,
nearly 30 fairs were held to exhibit technologies and in-
dustrial products in INTEX OSAKA, an international ex-
hibition hall, during the ﬁscal year 2011. We examined
in detail the list of events and found that only six of
those events received a designation. For example, fairs
for microfabrication technology, high-precision process-
ing technology, high-density processing technology,
waste disposal technology, energy-saving technology,
and R&D support equipment such as analysis/measuring
equipment, were not designated by the Commissioner. It
is thus obvious that the Commissioner’s designation
covered only a part of the fairs held.

The use of the GP for disclosures made through pre-
sentations at academic conferences sponsored by aca-
demic societies has not increased, but the use of GP for
disclosures at exhibitions and fairs has increased. This
phenomenon seems to be attributable to the removal of
the need for designation, as mentioned above. Universities

that do not run their own businesses can present their
research results mainly at academic conferences, but not
at fairs or exhibitions that are designed to enable people
to ﬁnd business partners and develop sales channels. It is
presumed that, in the case of universities that give their
presentations mainly at academic conferences, the num-
ber of applicatiosn where the GP applies has not increased
in tandem with the revision made to the Patent Act, since
these conferences had been designated even prior to the
legal revision.

Analysis by type of disclosure
As mentioned earlier, when we look at the types of dis-
closures, the number of presentations made at academic
conferences has not increased much, while that at fairs
and exhibitions has increased 3.6 times (from 87 to 316).
In addition, the GP was used in 142 cases for ‘the act of
selling’ which became eligible for the GP, with SMEs
accounting for almost 50 per cent of those cases. In total,
‘the act of selling’ accounts for 17 per cent of the GP use
among SMEs, and 7.7 per cent among large companies.

Has the expanded scope of the GP sent a wrong
message to users of the patent system? Concern has been
expressed that the existence of the GP itself sends the
wrong message, meaning that it may be used without

much consideration. This is seen as a negative view of
the GP.

We focus on large companies ﬁrst, in order to verify
this point. Large companies as a whole manage their
intellectual property thoroughly, so it is hard to believe
that their intellectual property management has become
lax in response to the expansion of the GP. Even if the
Patent Act revision sends out the wrong message, it is
difﬁcult to think that large companies would be affected
by this. What, then, is the case of ‘academic conferences’
whose scope of use of the GP has not expanded substan-
tively? The number of cases in which the GP is used for
presentations at academic conferences by large compan-
ies has barely increased (by approximately 2 per cent).
This indicates that large companies carefully manage in-
tellectual property and provide their employees with a
certain level of education on intellectual property.

Compared with this data, the use of GP by universities
(including collaborative research involving universities)
has increased only by 1.3 per cent (from 461 to 467). If
the expansion of
the GP were sending the wrong
message, i.e., that the GP can be evoked for technology
that was disclosed in a presentation before a patent ap-
plication for the technology has been ﬁled, the use of GP
for presentations at academic conferences by universities
should have increased more. However, there was no such
tendency. In recent years, universities have focused on
educating their teaching staff about IP and IP manage-
ment by establishing intellectual property headquarters
and academic-industrial collaboration organizations.
Moreover, a panellist said at the symposium that univer-
sities furnish teaching staff with the smallest amount of
information possible on this revision to the Patent Act
so that the expansion of the GP does not send the wrong
message. Persons who provide education and who
manage intellectual property rights may have prevented
a negative message from being sent.

The question here is why the use of the GP for disclo-
sures through the internet, which was eligible for the GP
in the past, has increased overall 2.5 times (from 128 to
331). In response to this, some may point out that the
expanded scope of the GP did send the wrong message.
However, we should note that the use of the GP for dis-
closures made by large companies through the internet
has increased by 400 per cent (from 34 to 136). We
repeat that large companies exercise thorough IP man-
agement, so it is hard to believe that the expanded scope
of the GP relaxed their IP management. We do not think

that this is because large companies have started to use
GP without giving it any consideration, and thus assume
that there is another reason for the increase in the use of
GP for online disclosures.

One plausible theory is that ‘the act of selling’ is now
eligible for the GP. It is impossible to know the purpose(s)
of disclosing an invention on the internet based on the
data for the convenience of application documents sub-
mitted to the Japan Patent Ofﬁce. However, large com-
panies are considered to use the internet mainly for the
purpose of promoting sales and introducing their pro-
ducts, and not for any academic purpose such as sharing
research results. Since ‘the act of selling’ is eligible for GP,
this facility can now be used for inventions publicized or
disclosed on the internet for promotional purposes. The
fact that online disclosure was not clearly listed may have
made patent applicants hesitant about ﬁling applications
evoking the GP. Now, since ‘the act of selling’ has clearly
become eligible for GP, more large companies may have
started to ﬁle applications for GP when making disclo-
sures on the internet for sales purposes. Still, this is our
assumption, and we will not know the real reason for the
increase unless we interview companies.

Breakdown of use of GP by technical ﬁeld
When comparing applications using the GP for disclo-
sures from April to December 2011 and from April to
December 2012 by technical ﬁeld, the ratios of Section A
‘Human Necessities’, Section E ‘Fixed Constructions’ and
Section F ‘Mechanical Engineering, Lighting, Heating,
Weapons, Blasting’ are increasing in the International
Patent Classiﬁcation (IPC)13 (see Figures 4 and 5).

Although we need to wait for a detailed analysis of
each case, the details of inventions can be easily viewed as
product shapes in the case of these sections (the details of
inventions are not the ratio of components but chemical
formulas).

The use of the GP for disclosures at fairs, etc, has
increased due to this revision of the Patent Act, and inven-
tions are disclosed in the form of actual products dis-
played at those fairs. The changed breakdown by technical
ﬁeld is assumed to have a certain relationship with the in-
creasing use of the GP with respect to disclosures of
inventions at fairs.

Ratio of accelerated examination
What is interesting in the data provided by the JPO is the
ratio of applications requesting accelerated examination.

Table 3 compares the number of applications for which
requests for examination have been ﬁled and applications
for which requests for accelerated examination have been
ﬁled as of 18 March 2013 with all applications and
applications invoking GP with respect to applications
ﬁled from April to December 2012 (excluding PCT appli-
cations that entered the national phase in Japan).

The ratio of requests for accelerated examination in the
case of applications ﬁled by using the GP is higher than
that in the case of applications ﬁled without using GP. Cur-
rently, work-related applications, internationally ﬁled appli-
cations, applications ﬁled by SMEs and venture companies
and applications ﬁled by universities, Technology Licensing
Organizations and public research institutions etc are eli-
gible for accelerated examination in Japan.

The results for some applications requesting acceler-
ated examination have already been released. At this
point, 62 applications have been examined, and 92 per
cent of them have been granted patents. (See Table 4).
Taking into account the fact that the ratio of patent-
granting decisions in the calendar year 2011 was 60.5 per
cent, we see that the ratio of patent-granting decisions in
applications using the GP is higher than that for regular
applications.

The principle of the ﬁrst-to-ﬁle system is that inven-
tions that have been disclosed before the respective patent
applications have been ﬁled may not be patented, as the
very fact of the inventions being disclosed renders them
prior art. However, in spite of this principle, inventions
ﬁled by using the GP as an exception to this rule are con-
sidered to be important for applicants.

When we look at the data, we recall the comment
made by a symposium panellist that there have been cases
in which SMEs and venture companies start to provide
products before ﬁling patent applications for them, and
then ﬁle patent applications after they come to know that
those products are popular. This supports the idea that
some applications that take advantage of the GP are ﬁled
in respect of highly praised high-quality inventions.

Results of questionnaire survey on the
expansion of the scope of the GP
In July 2013, the JPO conducted a survey on the results
of the Patent Act revision. The results of the survey are
included in the report by the Tegernsee Group.14

According to the results of this survey, more than
80 per cent of the respondents approve the expanded
scope of the GP; the said respondents exclude those who
answered that it was premature for them to evaluate (see
Figure 6).

Below are some comments on the advantages of the

GP, based on the responses to the questionnaire survey.
† Our university intends to ﬁle as many patent applica-
tions as possible before making presentations on inven-
tions. However, the GP is helpful, because researchers
in universities tend to make presentations ﬁrst.
† Since researchers in universities have a lower aware-
ness of the importance of ﬁling patent applications
compared to employees at companies, it is preferable
for universities to have the GP system as a safety net.
† In some cases, SMEs that don’t have even one person
in charge of IP do not even recognize the requirement
of ‘novelty.’ The role of the GP is great to protect
newly-born technology.
† There are cases where a person comes to consult his/
her patent application after the disclosure at a fair and
learns novelty for the ﬁrst time due to lack of knowl-
edge of the patent system.

On the other hand, there were some negative comments:
† Because of the GP, there is a tendency for inventors to
present
their inventions at academic conferences
without giving much thought about the consequences
of doing so. There is a concern that this tendency will
become more prevalent.
† Although the scope of the GP was expanded, and this
is beneﬁcial, there is also a risk that an idea might be
stolen by others, on the other hand.

As we have argued earlier, it is difﬁcult to think that this
revision to the Patent Act sends a wrong message at this
moment, with regard to the ﬁrst negative comment
above. With regard to the second negative comment, we
should not blame the GP system itself. It goes without
saying that there is always a risk that an idea can be
stolen by others when an invention is publicized, even
when there is no option of using the GP. Taking into
account the fact that GP is nothing but a relief measure,
it should not be used frequently in the ﬁrst place.

Evaluation of the revision made to
Japanese Patent Act
We next consider whether the revision of Japan’s Patent
Act was positive or negative for system users.

More than 80 per cent of respondents have a positive
opinion of the GP system, according to the question-
naire. Looking at the use of GP and the new modes that
were added following this revision, we note that the GP
is being used increasingly for fairs and sales. This indi-
cates that inventions that had been previously disclosed
can now take advantage of the revised GP, whereas they
could not have before. Moreover, it is worth noting that
the utilization rate of
the accelerated examination
system is high, and the rate to grant patents is also high.
That is to say, this revision of the Patent Act paves the
way for applicants to obtain patent rights for important
inventions, which they were unable to do in the past,
providing them with a more reﬁned safety net.

We should not forget that some individuals made
negative comments about the expanded scope of the GP.
They were concerned that, thanks to the GP, more pre-
sentations would be made without inventors giving
careful thought about the consequences. However, the
use of the GP for presentations at academic conferences
by universities and public research institutions has
not increased signiﬁcantly. We can thus say that the
expanded GP has not had a negative impact on IP man-
agement and IP education. We believe that it is necessary

to inform the public thoroughly that the GP should
serve as nothing more than a safety net.

Another negative view of the GP relates to legal cer-
tainty of patent systems, a point that was also discussed at
the symposiums. In Japan, regardless of whether applica-
tions are sought, the use of the GP is speciﬁed in the pub-
lication of unexamined patent applications when the 18-
month publication is made (see Figure 7). This is one so-
lution to this issue. A panellist commented that this
would contribute to systemic certainty. Professor Straus
added that the Japanese system could be an alternative to
taking legal certainty into consideration (if consideration
of legal certainty were to lead to a compellingly different
result, a system comparable to that applied in Japan and
other States might offer an acceptable alternative).15

As previously discussed, in the USA, the Rules of
Practice of the AIA of February 2013 require ‘an earlier
disclosure by an applicant to be described’ in the speciﬁ-
cation, although this is not obligatory. The Rules explain
that the reason for this is to eliminate unnecessary notiﬁ-
cations of reasons for refusal. This is intended to con-
tribute to the certainty of patent systems to some extent.
In addition to such measure, as far as we know, there is
no speciﬁc individual case in which the use of the GP has
caused any uncertainty as to the patent system in Japan.
No panellist at the symposiums held in Tokyo and Osaka
reported any speciﬁc inconvenience, and we have not
heard that any problem was caused by the expansion of
the GP based on the revision to the Patent Act.

We would like to introduce here the part relating to cer-
tainty from the results of the survey undertaken in Japan in

response to the agreement by the Tegernsee Group. Only
eight (ie 2 per cent) among the 412 respondents answered
that their business activities and research activities were ad-
versely affected because the GP was used by others, and no
one reported that this situation led to a lawsuit.

Moreover, Professor Straus stated in his paper,16 with
regard to Germany and the United Kingdom, two coun-
tries that had the GP in the past, that:

Neither the British or German Patent Ofﬁce, nor British nor
German courts have any particular problems in coping with
the grace period.

The utilization rate of the GP in Japan has always
been relatively low and would not greatly exceed 1 per
cent of all patent applications even if it doubled, al-
though, at this early stage, it is impossible to draw con-
clusions about the effects of the revision of the Patent
Law from the perspective of legal certainty. It may be ne-
cessary to follow up on this decade after decade in order
to obtain results. In any case, it is hard to imagine that
there has been any signiﬁcant negative impact.

Towards harmonization
How can harmonization be achieved? It is clear that Japa-
nese users expect the patent system to be harmonized in
line with the expanded scope of the GP. Japanese users
have a positive opinion of the GP, given their positive
image of the 2011 revision to the Patent Act and the
manner in which it expanded the scope of eligibility for
the GP. This view is also apparent from the results of the
Tegernsee Group survey.

Figure 7. Sample of Publication of unexamined patent applications in Japan. [Note] Please refer to the part pointed by the arrow. This
part tells that the applicant of this application has requested to use the GP. This part, if translated in English, says “Request for applying
the Article 30 of Patent Act has been made. Inventions are published in XXXX dated DD,MM, 2013.”. The article 30 of Japanese Patent
Act provides the GP.

Seventy-ﬁve per cent of the respondents to the ques-
tionnaire supported the GP. Looking at the results per
attribute of the respondents, we can see that large com-
panies have the lowest support rate, but even so, it is still
69 per cent (see Figure 8).

Support for the GP is also evident from the answers
to other questions. Other questions, asking users about
their perception of the GP, had both positive and nega-
tive options, and the respondents were asked to choose
all applicable options (multiple responses possible). The
results in Figure 9 show that the number of positive
options (ie 354) was 2.6 times higher than the number
of negative options (ie 135).

In the symposiums, all the panellists remarked that
‘they were trying to avoid using the GP as much as pos-
sible’. This was true not only for representatives of large
companies but also for SMEs and universities. They all
shared this common view. In addition, it was conﬁrmed
in the symposiums that SMEs and universities use the
GP more frequently than large companies do. This was
also proved by the survey (see Figure 10).

This is considered to be a sufﬁciently convincing result.
It is not easy for SMEs to control the disclosure of new
technologies by setting up IP departments or educating
persons in charge of development on the patent system,
as large companies do. Moreover,
teaching staff at

universities tend to place more importance on presenta-
tions at academic conferences than on patent applica-
tions, and the decision whether to obtain patents lies
within their discretion. Nevertheless, SMEs and univer-
sities in Japan do not necessarily use the GP frequently. It
is certain that they take advantage of the GP, using it only
as a safety net out of necessity. It is not simple to use the
GP in terms of costs and procedures.

The Patent Law Treaty (PLT) provides various means
of assisting users, and this is why it was ratiﬁed as a user-
friendly system by many countries. If the GP is a ‘safety
net’, it should gain more popularity like the PLT. That is,
it will be necessary in the future to have the proper
mind-set on the GP in discussions on patent harmoniza-
tion, such as ‘establishing a user-friendly system’ and
‘developing safety nets’.

Another important issue discussed at the symposiums
was that GP in Europe is very limited in scope as com-
pared to other countries. The limited scope of GP in
Europe leads to a situation where the use of the GP in
Japan, for example, has almost the same meaning as
giving up the acquisition of right in Europe. That is, the
use of the GP in Japan closes the applicants’ way to ac-
quiring rights in Europe, since only Europe applies the
‘principle of patent systems’ of the ﬁrst-to-ﬁle system in
an extremely strict manner. If taking into account the

fact
that patent application activities are becoming
global in line with the advance in economic globalization
now days, it is desirable to eliminate differences between
systems in individual countries and regions as far as pos-
sible in order to avoid the above mentioned problematic
situation.

As explained above, Austria, Italy, Germany, Switzer-
land and the United Kingdom used to have the GP in the
past, but it was abolished in 1973 when the EPC was

adopted. The reason was that ‘where such protection
existed in Europe which did not exist in non-contracting
states, this [generous provision for scope] would give
inventors a false sense of security leading them to lose
their rights if they ﬁled in those countries’.17

The use of the GP when an application is ﬁled in
Japan leads to the loss of opportunity for acquiring a
right in Europe. This is similar to the concern which
was discussed when the EPC was ﬁrst formulated. The

Shohei Ishimaru and Yuichiro Nakaya . International harmonization of the grace period: the experience of Japan ARTICLE

73

Japanese government does not maintain the GP system
to give patent system users a grace period for ﬁling appli-
cations, but provides a safety net in cases where an appli-
cation was publicized due to unavoidable reasons. Users
do not think that there is no problem in delaying the
ﬁling of patent applications simply because of the exist-
ence of the GP that covers a certain period of time. This
is clearly seen in the results of the questionnaire and the
symposium discussions. Moreover, as explained earlier,
applicants continue consider their inventions, with
regard to which the GP was used, as very important:
they still want to acquire patent rights in the ﬁrst place.
Further, it is an indisputable fact that there are countries
and regions where such important inventions are pro-
tected (relieved) and countries and regions where they
are not protected, even if the inventions are publicized at
the same moment all over the world. This is unbelievable
in our age of global economic activity. Unfortunately,
the current safety net is broken in some parts of the
world and users who are not well acquainted with the
differences or pitfalls in the indivual national or regional
systems run great risks.

The European system does clarify legal certainty by
issuing the important message that ‘any disclosure is
not to be made before ﬁling a patent application for
the invention that is to be disclosed’, simplifying the
entire patent system. However, the disclosure of new
technologies is not limited to places such as inter-
national exhibitions. Technological inventions such as
laboratory-level seed technology and software-related
inventions that are not publicized at international exhibi-
tions are forced to be treated discriminatorily, as they
cannot be protected under the safety net of the GP in the
ﬁrst place.

The safety net has a serious problem. In Japanese
users’ opinion, it is broken in some respects. In other

The lack of a ‘grace period’ under the UK patent system means that many
great ideas invented in UK Universities may only be patentable in other
countries such as the USA and Canada. This inevitably means that certain
inventions are more likely to be developed in the USA. The pressure to
publish and to freely disclose ideas to other academics to disseminate
information for the public good is a fundamental right of academics and
should be inviolate. However, the need for a patent system that allows a
short window of opportunity to recover from inadvertent disclosure would
be good for UK inventions and UK competitiveness. We can produce many
examples of inventions that have either been inadvertently disclosed or
have only been commercialised in the USA.

words, in Japan, a country that has a grace period pro-
viding a wide scope of application, we wonder if users in
Europe encounter problems because they do not have
the GP available to them. It seems that this might be the
case. Some universities made comments in support of
creating a GP with broader eligibility, in response to the
review on ‘how the intellectual property framework
supports growth and innovation’18 released by the UK
Intellectual Property Ofﬁce (UKIPO) based on a request
from British Prime Minister Cameron.

A paper written by Professor Straus presents the
Fraunhofer Patent Centre in Germany as follows: ‘At the
Fraunhofer Patent Centre in Germany, annually, for in-
stance for some 650 inventions, patent applications
cannot be ﬁled in Europe due to pre-ﬁling disclosure.’19
We would like to introduce interesting data here,
namely the ranking of universities by number of Patent Co-
operation Treaty (PCT) applications ﬁled. No university in
Europe is listed in the top ﬁfty.20 What does this mean?
Could this data possibly be related to the lack of availability
of the GP in Europe or is there any other reason?

In the GP system in China, where the number of patent
applications is increasing rapidly, the eligibility for the GP
is limited to disclosures at international exhibitions and
presentations at government designated academic confer-
ences. Therefore the scope of eligibility is very narrow
from the users’ points of view, as it is in the case of
Europe. Applicants who accept the European system as a
standard may not ﬁnd any problem. However, if the aim
is to establish a more user-friendly system, it is possible to
achieve a win-win outcome not only for system users but
also for respective governments in the long run.

Fortunately, the current situation is different from
what it was in 1973, when the EPC was adopted. As of
2000, the GP was in place in more than 30 countries.21
A report by the Tegernsee Group shows that users in

The requirement for an invention to be conﬁdential prior to an application
to patent does cause problems in a university context. Academics are keen
to share information as soon as possible. This frequently means that
applications are being rushed through shortly before the publication of an
article or before a presentation. This affects the thought that can be put
into securing the quality of the claims: it also curtails the period for further
research to reﬁne the invention. The 12 month grace period which applies
under the US system would be advantageous in this regard. The University
often has to take very early decisions to patent whereas a later view might
result in no patent being applied for at all. We recognise though that it
raises the potential of subsequent interference proceedings.

France and the United Kingdom are gradually becoming
more willing to discuss the GP.22

As for the direction to take in terms of GP harmoniza-
tion, we hope that the system would be simple and easy
to understand for both users and patent ofﬁces world-
wide, based on the common understanding that the GP
is to be used for nothing more than ‘a safety net’. The GP
system can be based on common procedures and
requirements in individual countries and regions so that
a person who wants to use the GP as a safety net can do
so without fail. There are two basic ideas on this issue:
either (i) to adjust current systems to the existing

system, which seems to be better, in a particular country
or region or (ii) to establish a new, better system aiming
for the best practices. In our personal opinion, the ﬁrst
option is more beneﬁcial to practitioners.

Although the United States has stuck to the ﬁrst-to-
invent system for many years, it has taken a giant step
toward international harmonization by enacting the AIA. In
the same way, we believe that harmonization in a new era
will advance if all countries swiftly move into action without
losing the momentum. We hope that all parties concerned
will have serious discussions and make efforts so that GP
harmonization becomes a reality as soon as possible.
