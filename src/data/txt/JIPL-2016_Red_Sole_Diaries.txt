‘Red Sole Diaries’: a tale on the enforcement
of Louboutin’s position mark
Carina Gommers and Eva De Pauw*

Louboutin and the issue of position
marks

It is unnecessary to introduce Louboutin. The French
‘high fashion’ shoe manufacturer is a celebrities’ darling
and his fame is worldwide. Louboutin’s high-heeled, red-
soled shoes are not only a fashionista’s dream; they have
probably caused sleepless nights to trade mark ofﬁcers and
judges who had to rule on the validity and enforcement of
this ‘position mark’, consisting of the colour red Pantone
18-1663TP applied to the sole of a high-heeled shoe.

‘Position marks’ might be said to be a speciﬁc, uncon-
ventional type of trade mark that has arrived on the
trade mark scene rather recently. The notion of ‘position
marks’ is used in relation to ‘a sign which consists of ele-
ments (ﬁgurative, colour, etc.) positioned on a particular
part of a product and being in a particular proportion to
the size of the product’ (see the Guidelines for Examin-
ation in the Ofﬁce for Harmonisation in the Internal
Market (Trade Marks and Designs) on Community Trade
Marks, Part B Examination, par. 2.2.14).

Below are some examples of position marks that were

rejected:

The trade marks depicted below were, however, accepted:
In addition, a distinct sui generis type of marks, related
to position marks, are what the Ofﬁce for Harmonisation
in the Internal Market (OHIM) calls ‘pattern marks’, ie,
signs consisting of a set of elements which are repeated
regularly and are intended to cover the entire surface of
the goods at issue such as, for example, Louis Vuitton’s
chequerboard pattern which was, however, revoked re-
cently because it was said to lack inherent distinctive
character and acquired distinctiveness could not be
proven for all the EU Member States.2

Other examples of pattern marks include:

This article
† This article intends to provide the reader with a
cross-border overview of decisions handed down in
relation to Louboutin’s struggle to obtain trade
mark registrations for its famous ‘red sole mark’, as
well as to enforce the same in infringement proceed-
ings before the courts.1

† The red sole mark is also an excellent starting point
from which to address the wider issue of so-called
position marks. Whereas the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) and the General Court
have so far refrained from explicitly qualifying pos-
ition marks or pattern marks as belonging to either
of the ‘traditional’ categories of trade marks, several
national courts have taken a position on this issue.
Some have qualiﬁed the red sole position mark as a
colour mark, while others assessed it as a ﬁgurative
mark or a shape mark or something in between. The
consequences of this choice are very important. If,
for instance, the mark is qualiﬁed as a shape mark,
then it risks being excluded from trade mark protec-
tion for giving substantial value to the goods. This
exclusion ground cannot be overcome by the (un-
disputed) acquired distinctiveness and renown of
Louboutin’s mark. At least one judge has recently
considered reaching out to the CJEU for more guid-
ance on this matter.

† Finally, the article discusses the impact that the recently
published new trade mark legislation is likely to have
on this issue.

signs that can constitute a trade mark in Art. 4 CTMR,
this does not prevent them from being accepted for
registration as a trade mark, provided that they meet the
other requirements for registration. The views on what is
a registrable sign have indeed evolved over time and it
is now generally accepted that, for instance, colours,
sounds or even holograms—which are not mentioned in
the non-exhaustive list of Art. 4 CTMR either—can con-
stitute a valid trade mark provided that the general con-
ditions for trade mark protection are met. In addition,
the OHIM requires that ‘(t)he representation of the

mark supplied must be accompanied by a description in-
dicating the exact nature of the right concerned’.3

Without actually qualifying position marks or pattern
marks as belonging to either of the ‘traditional’ categor-
ies of shape marks, colour marks or two-dimensional
ﬁgurative marks, the CJEU and the General Court have
already made it clear—in a series of decisions—that the
criteria for assessing the inherent distinctive character,
and hence the possibility of registration of this type of
marks, are basically the same or very similar to those
applying to shape marks consisting of the appearance of

bodies’ assessment of the registrability of the Louboutin
red sole mark.

Overview of proceedings before
administrative trade mark bodies
(refusals and oppositions)
French trade mark
Louboutin’s very ﬁrst trade mark application was a French
national application (n8 3067674 ﬁled on 29 November
2000) for a combined, semi-ﬁgurative trade mark consist-
ing of a picture of a red sole for ‘shoes’ in Class 25, bearing
the words ‘Christian Louboutin Vero Cuiro made in Italy
38’ without mentioning a Pantone colour code but with
the added (optional) description ‘semelle de chaussure de
couleur rouge’ (in English: ‘shoe sole in the colour red’):

the product itself.4 These criteria are mainly that the sign
must depart signiﬁcantly from the norm or customs of
the sector, and that the relevant consumer must be likely
to perceive the sign as an independent feature being dis-
tinguishable from the product itself. Practice has shown
that position marks are often held not to meet this
threshold once they have to withstand the scrutiny of the
GC or the CJEU,5 and in a number of cases (see below)
this was also a problem for Louboutin. However, a lack
of inherent distinctive character can be overcome by
proving acquired distinctiveness, which we think is not
and should not be a problem for Louboutin.

But the Louboutin case has an additional dimension in
that it also calls to question the applicability of certain of
the exclusion grounds for shape marks, such as the refusal
grounds for shapes that confer substantial value to the
goods at issue, which cannot be remedied or overcome by
showing an acquired distinctiveness. This is crucial in the
Louboutin case since a number of courts have indicated
that they think this absolute ground of refusal applies to
the red sole mark. Whereas this truly crucial question is yet
undecided pending a referral to the CJEU, several courts
have already had their say on certain other aspects, unfor-
tunately resulting in sometimes contradictory decisions.
We will report on these court decisions below, but will ﬁrst
dedicate a few words on the administrative trade mark

This trade mark, which also formed the basis for an
International application (n8 759326 of 23 May 2001,
designating Spain, Italy and Japan (where the mark was
accepted) and the UK (where the mark was refused))
was revoked by the French courts in 2011 (see below),
although previously Louboutin had been able to enforce
it in a number of cases before the French courts (see
below).

Community trade mark
As the OHIM’s practice and guidelines on ‘special trade
marks’ (read: colour marks, shape marks, position
marks) expanded, Louboutin itself also went through a
learning curve in its trade mark ﬁling strategy.

In 2006, Louboutin had another try by ﬁling a Com-
munity trade mark application for a ﬁgurative trade
mark consisting of a red sole, again without specifying
the colour red, amongst others for shoes in Class 25.
This trade mark was registered without objections by the
OHIM (CTM no. 5282322).

However, the company’s later trade mark applications
are no longer conﬁned to a two-dimensional representa-
tion of a shoe sole in an (unspeciﬁed) red colour, but are
much more concise, in line with the OHIM’s current
guidelines on how colour marks and position marks
should be represented and applied for (see above). More
speciﬁcally, Louboutin later applied for the ‘red sole’
mark as a Community trade mark (application n8
8845539 ﬁled on 29 January 2010, claiming seniority
from a 2007 UK registration and a 2009 Benelux regis-
tration with n8 874489) in relation to Class 25 goods (ie,
‘shoes (except orthopaedic footwear)’). The sign applied
for looks as follows:

The accompanying description reads ‘(t)he trade
mark consists of the colour red (Pantone 18.1663TP)
applied to the sole of a shoe as shown (the outline of the
shoe is therefore not part of the trade mark but serves to
show the positioning of the trade mark)’.

The OHIM Board of Appeal accepted the trade mark
for registration, but only after an initial refusal decision.6
The grounds which inspired the OHIM Examiner to
initially refuse the application were as follows. The
Examiner qualiﬁed the sign as a colour mark per se and
ruled, in line with the established case law on colour
marks, that it would be contrary to the public interest to
restrict other shoe manufacturer’s possibility to use the
colour red for shoe soles. The Examiner was of the
opinion that the colour red, applied to a certain shape,
did not have an inherent distinctive character, because
there are many shoes on the market in a multitude of
colours, including the soles. In addition, the Examiner
was of the opinion that Louboutin did not prove that
the sign had acquired distinctiveness through use.

Louboutin ﬁled an appeal against this refusal decision
and the OHIM Board of Appeal, in its decision of 16
June 2011 (Case R 2272/2010-2), overturned the initial
refusal decision. The Board of Appeal conﬁrmed that the
sign at issue was not a mere colour mark in the sense of
the Libertel case law,7 but that it instead related to the
colour red Pantone n8 18.1663TP applied to the sole of a
high-heeled shoe. The Board relied on generally acquired
practical experience that the soles of high-heeled shoes
are generally black, brown or beige, to reach the conclu-
sion that the colour red Pantone n8 18.1663TP, applied
to the sole of a high-heeled shoe, does signiﬁcantly
depart from the norms or customs of the sector, and that
the sign will therefore be perceived as ‘fanciful, surprising

6

Louboutin also had to overcome third-party observations ﬁled against the
registration of the trademark, citing some isolated Internet offers (mainly
on eBay) of other high-heeled shoes with red soles.

7 CJEU, 6 May 2003, Case C-104/01, Libertel Groep BV v Benelux-

Merkenbureau, which—amongst others—stressed the importance of ‘the

general interest in not unduly restricting the availability of colours for the
other traders who offer for sale goods or services of the same type as those
in respect of which registration is sought’.

and unexpected’ and is easy to remember for the
consumer. The Board did not address the issue of
acquired distinctiveness since it ruled that Louboutin’s
mark has an inherent distinctive character and
because Louboutin had not relied on acquired dis-
tinctiveness (the OHIM Examiner had addressed this
of her own motion).

Hence, Louboutin’s Community trade mark applica-
tion was allowed to be published for registration, with a
limitation of the goods to high-heeled shoes only. Lou-
boutin’s Community trade mark application survived an
opposition by the German shoe manufacturer Roland SE
based on an earlier trade mark consisting of the words
‘my SHOES’ depicted in a blue and red rectangle. In all
three instances, ending with a judgment of the General
Court in July 2015,8 the opposition was rejected given
the lack of similarity of the signs.

Louboutin also ﬁled the position mark as a French na-

tional trade mark (n8 3869370) in 2011.

Before that time,

in 2007, Louboutin had already
applied for the same ‘position mark’ representation of
the red sole in the US and this resulted in the grant of a
trade mark in 2008 (Serial Number 77141789). The US
trade mark, however, does not mention a Pantone colour
code but it does contain a description similar to the later
Community trade mark application, ie, ‘the colour(s) red
is/are claimed as a feature of the mark. The mark consists
of a red lacquered outsole on footwear that contrasts
with the colour of the adjoining (“upper”) portion of the
shoe. The dotted lines are not part of the mark but are
intended only to show placement of the mark’.9

Based on its 2007 UK mark, Louboutin also ﬁled an
International trade mark application (n8 1031242 of 3
February 2010) for ‘ladies footwear’ in Class 25, desig-
nating nine countries,10 with a similar description as the
Community trade mark application. In many instances,
the application was refused because of lack of distinctive
character. Seven out of the nine national trade mark
ofﬁces issued a preliminary refusal, in most cases based
on a lack of inherent distinctive character. In four cases,
the preliminary refusal could be overturned and the
mark was ﬁnally accepted, mainly based on acquired dis-
tinctiveness. In Japan, the mark was ﬁnally refused,

8

See OHIM Opposition Division, 21 June 2013, Opposition no. B 1 922 890,
conﬁrmed by the OHIM Board of Appeal, 28 May 2014, Case R 1591/2013-
1, and by the General Court, 16 July 2015, Case T-631/14. In 2013,
Louboutin summoned Roland SE before the Paris First Instance Court to
obtain a declaration that Roland SE committed abuse of law by continuing
to pursue the opposition against Louboutin’s Community trade mark
application, however, the court ruled it had no jurisdiction to hear the case
(Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, 17 July 2014, Case no. 13/15750,
Christian Louboutin v Roland SE, darts-917-377-B-fr). Two other third
parties also ﬁled oppositions against Louboutin’s Community trade mark
application but both oppositions were found inadmissible. The trade mark

seemingly for reasons proper to Japanese trade mark law
excluding the registration of colour marks or position
marks. The ﬁnal decisions of the Chinese PTO and of
the Swiss PTO (which initially ruled that the use of the
red sole is merely decorative) are still pending according
to our latest information.

This overview is not exhaustive. Louboutin has also
ﬁled national trade mark applications in other countries,
which we will not address individually.

Overview of court cases/Infringement
cases
An important aspect in the infringement cases is the
qualiﬁcation of Louboutin’s red sole trade mark. Al-
though this does not matter in the sense of the assess-
ment of the sign’s (inherent or acquired) distinctive
character, a number of court decisions have made it
clear that this can matter a great deal in the assessment
of whether the exclusion grounds for shape marks of
Art. 7(1)(e) CTMR/Art. 3(1)(e) Trade Mark Directive
apply. Indeed, if the red sole is qualiﬁed as a shape mark,
and more speciﬁcally as a shape mark to which one of
the absolute refusal grounds apply, then it can never
acquire distinctiveness through use.

We will start our overview with the decisions of the
French courts, taking into account that France is Lou-
boutin’s home country, and will then move on to the
other jurisdictions.

France
The ﬁrst and most numerous cases were indeed dealt
with in Louboutin’s home country.

Louboutin/Zara France
Relying on its (very ﬁrst) French semi-ﬁgurative trade
mark with registration n8 3067674 (see above), Loubou-
tin in 2006 applied for descriptive seizure, and conse-
quently ﬁled an infringement case on the merits against
Zara who commercialized ladies’ shoes having red soles.

First instance decision : Tribunal de Grande Instance de
Paris (4th Ch.), 4 November 2008, Louboutin/Zara France,
case no. 06/1675011

is nevertheless not yet listed in the Community trade mark register as
having the status ‘registered’ (it still says ‘application opposed’).

9 The part of the description that reads ‘that contrasts with the colour of the

adjoining (“upper”) portion of the shoe’ was added later on, following a
limitation of the trade mark imposed by the US Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in the YSL case (see below).

10 The designated countries are: Australia, Switzerland, China, Japan,

Monaco, Norway, Russian Federation, Singapore and Ukraine.

Zara counterclaimed that Louboutin’s trade mark was
invalid because it did not meet the requirement of graphical
representation, which according to the CJEU’s established
case law (in, amongst others, Libertel (C-104/01)) must be
‘clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible,
durable and objective’. More speciﬁcally, according to Zara,
this condition was not met because it was difﬁcult to pre-
cisely identify the sign for which protection was sought: was
it the shape of a shoe sole or rather the colour red as applied
to a shoe sole? Additionally, Zara also claimed that Loubou-
tin’s trade mark failed to precisely deﬁne the colour red at
issue because it did not refer to an internationally recog-
nized colour code such (eg, RAL or Pantone) as suggested
by CJEU in the Libertel judgment. We note that France is a
bit speciﬁc here in the sense that using such a colour code
has become mandatory since 2008,12 whereas the CJEU case
law does not actually impose this but simply says that it is
an appropriate manner to satisfy the requirements of clear,
precise etc. representation.

The Paris ﬁrst instance court rejected Zara’s invalidity
counterclaim. It ruled that the details available in the French
trade mark register did allow to immediately conclude that
Louboutin’s mark did not simply consist of a picture of a
shoe sole nor of the colour red as such, but of ‘a shoe sole to
which other elements are associated: a red colour and an in-
scription’ (the latter consisting of the name ‘Christian Lou-
boutin’, in addition to the words ‘Vero Cuiro made in Italy
38’ which are, however, non-distinctive because this is lan-
guage that regularly appears on the sole of a shoe). Because
of the presence of these additional elements, there was no
need to specify the colour red by reference to an internation-
ally recognized colour code. Also in the court’s view, the
presence in Louboutin’s trade mark of these additional ele-
ments on top of the (unspeciﬁed) colour red prevented Lou-
boutin from obtaining a monopoly on the colour red as
such.

However, the ﬁrst instance court was of the opinion that
Louboutin’s trade mark was not infringed because there was
no risk of confusion in the case at hand. This decision is
based on the court’s considerations that (i) contrary to Lou-
boutin’s trade mark, the allegedly counterfeiting Zara shoes
did not contain the wording ‘Christian Louboutin’ but the
wording ‘Zara’ on their soles, (ii) the Zara shoes were com-
mercialized through very different distribution channels
(limited production and luxury image of Louboutin vs. the
much larger distribution network of Zara), and (iii) the en-
tirely different price setting.

Nevertheless, unfair competition rules brought relief to
Louboutin who managed to obtain the requested injunction
after all. The court’s reasoning seems a bit artiﬁcial and the
line with the trade mark infringement assessment is thin.
More speciﬁcally, the court ruled that ‘whereas the compari-
son of its trade mark and the soles of the ZARA shoes shows

a sufﬁcient difference so as to avoid counterfeit, by using a
red sole for certain of its shoes, ZARA does voluntarily
create a confusion, not between its sole and the LOUBOU-
TIN trade mark, but between its shoes and the LOUBOU-
TIN shoes, because it allows its clients who buy a red soled
ZARA shoe to make it look as if the shoe is a creation of
Christian Louboutin’.

The reasoning of the Paris ﬁrst instance court in the Zara
case is very similar to the one it applied before in a similar
case initiated by Louboutin against Cesare Paciotti who also
commercialized a line of shoes having a red sole. However,
in that case, the court decided that there was no unfair com-
petition either (see Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris
(3rd Ch.), 5 December 2007, Christian Louboutin/Cesare
Paciotti, case no. 06/0622813) because the prominent use of
the Cesare Paciotti name for the alleged counterfeit shoes
avoided any risk of confusion. Another difference with the
Zara case is that, in the Cesare Paciotti case, the court was
also asked to assess whether the defendant took unfair ad-
vantage of the reputation of Louboutin’s trade mark, but in
the absence of presentation of any consumer surveys by
Louboutin, the court did not consider the reputation of
Louboutin’s mark to be sufﬁciently established.
Appeal decision: Paris Court of Appeal, 22 June 2011, no.
06-1675014

Whereas the ﬁrst instance court conﬁrmed the validity of
Louboutin’s French ﬁgurative trade mark, the Court of
Appeal decided that neither the shape nor the colour of the
sign was determined in a manner that was sufﬁciently clear,
precise and self-contained in order to confer an own dis-
tinctive character to allow identifying the origin of the
shoes.15 More speciﬁcally, with respect to the shape, the
court said that the sole of a shoe cannot be deﬁned by a
two-dimensional form, and that the sign does not allow de-
termining whether it represents the outer view or the inner
view of the sole. In addition, the court ruled that the form
of the sole appears to be imposed by its nature or function
(the ‘upper’ part corresponding to the forefoot and the ‘nar-
rowed’ portion corresponding to the base of the high heel)
and does not have any distinctive character. With respect to
the colour, the Court ruled that the colour red in the trade
mark was not only undeﬁned but was also not uniform (the
ﬁgure contained several colour nuances of red). The Court
also saw the fact that Louboutin had found it necessary to
ﬁle a new trade mark, this time specifying the Pantone code
of the red colour, as an indication that Louboutin was aware
of the questionable character of the mark at issue in the
French proceedings. As a consequence, Louboutin’s French
trade mark was invalidated.

The Court also rejected Louboutin’s claim based on
unfair competition because otherwise, other market partici-
pants would be prohibited from commercializing shoes having
red soles and this would boil down to unduly monopolizing

a concept or an idea. The Court also took into account that
Christian Louboutin and Zara operated in a totally different
market, that Zara did not systematically use red for soles
and that shoes were only accessory business for Zara
anyway, and that there was no proof that Zara’s commercial-
ization of shoes having a red sole would lead to a more
rapid obsolescence of Louboutin’s products.

The supreme court appeal – which is limited to points of
law only – against this decision was rejected (French Supreme
Court, 30 May 2012, no. 11-2072416).

Louboutin/Nanjing
TGI Paris, 17 September 2010, case no 09/0486817. In
this case, Louboutin relied on, amongst others, its French
semi-ﬁgurative trade mark of 2000, the corresponding
international trade mark registration as well as on its later
ﬁled ﬁgurative Community trade mark no. 5282322, to
act against the sale of counterfeit shoes through a website
operated by a Chinese company. Whereas the Paris ﬁrst
instance court rejected Louboutin’s assertions under copy-
right law (for rather formalistic reasons, so it seems18), it
did withhold infringement of Louboutin’s ‘red sole’ ﬁgura-
tive trade marks. The validity of the trade mark was not
challenged in these proceedings, since the judgment was
rendered by default. The court also upheld the unfair
competition claim taking into account the intention to
deliberately create confusion which followed from various
circumstances, such as the unjustiﬁed use of the domain
name ‘christianlouboutinshop.com’ and the overall pres-
entation of the products.

Louboutin/Eden Shoes
TGI Paris, 7 January 2011, case no 09/0906619. In-
fringement proceedings on the merits by Louboutin
against Eden Shoes, after descriptive seizure in Eden
Shoes shops in France at the occasion of which it could
be established that Eden Shoes offered for sale at least
twelve different shoe models having a red sole.

Although the defendants questioned the distinctive
character of Louboutin’s ﬁgurative red sole trade mark,
they did not as such claim that it was invalid. The court
therefore merely ruled that the mark was distinctive
because it was a complex combination of several elements,
in the same way as it did in the Zara (ﬁrst instance) and
Paciotti cases before.

With respect to the assessment of infringement, the
court was of the opinion that there was no risk of confu-
sion because the shoe soles of the defendant’s footwear

17 See darts-345-965-A-fr.
18 Louboutin had omitted to specify in detail, in the writ of summons

introducing the proceedings, what exactly are the characteristics of its shoes
that render them ‘original’ in the sense required by copyright laws.

only used a (moreover darker) colour red and the
wording ‘Made in Italy’ (and not ‘Louboutin’), and the
defendant’s shoes contained a clearly visible mentioning
of the name ‘Eden Shoes’ on the inner sole. In addition,
the court gave weight to the fact that the distribution
networks were different. The court therefore concluded
that the decorative use of a red shoe sole, which existed
before Louboutin’s trade mark application, does not lead
to a risk of confusion in the absence of copying other
characteristic elements.

However, the court did rule that Louboutin’s trade
mark is famous and can therefore beneﬁt from the
enhanced protection for well-known trade marks. Even
though there was no risk of confusion, Eden Shoes’ use
of a red sole did cause the public to associate the sign
with Louboutin’s trade mark. For this reason, the court
imposed an injunction and condemned Eden Shoes to
pay damages, and no longer needed to rule on Loubou-
tin’s claim based on unfair competition.

Louboutin/Laken Ngami
Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, 16 October
2014, Case 13/0830120. In 2013, after having performed
a descriptive seizure, Louboutin summoned Laken
Ngami, an online trader in shoes and clothing, to stop
commercializing counterfeit ‘Louboutin’ shoes. Loubou-
tin relied on its copyright and several Community
design registrations in its shoe designs, and also on
several of its trade marks, including the French national
trade mark corresponding to the Community ‘position’
trade mark discussed above, and a few other (mainly
word) marks.

The defendant claimed that Louboutin’s position
mark was invalid for lack of distinctive character, but the
court rejected this reasoning. The defendant failed to
prove that the use of a red sole for high-heeled shoes was
widespread, whereas the exhibits submitted by Loubou-
tin proved that the use of a particular colour red to the
outer sole of a high-heeled shoe is actually perceived as a
sign that reveals the commercial origin of the Louboutin
shoes. Given the very important visual similarities with
Louboutin’s position mark, the court ruled that there
was a risk of confusion and imposed an injunction and
awarded damages to Louboutin. Louboutin’s copyright
and design rights were also held to be infringed, and the
court withheld acts of unfair competition distinct from
the counterfeit as such.

Louboutin/Mario Rossini Moda
Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, 11 October 2011,
Case 10/04152, Christian Louboutin v Mario Rossini Moda21
A few months after the decision of the Paris Court of
Appeal in the Zara case (see above), Louboutin’s French
ﬁgurative trade mark was again found invalid by the Paris
ﬁrst instance court. Strangely, the judgment does not refer
to the appeal judgment in the Zara case. The reasoning is,
however, similar. The court ruled that the sign did not
have any distinctive character because the shape aspects
were nothing more than an ordinary shoe sole, which
appears to be imposed by its nature or function, and
because the colour red was not precisely identiﬁed. The
court added that proving acquired distinctiveness would
not help Louboutin, because the absolute refusal ground
of shapes imposed by the nature or function of the
product applied. Louboutin’s claims based on unfair com-
petition were also rejected, mainly because the court was
of the opinion that a risk of confusion was excluded given
the difference in price and target public.

Belgium
Louboutin/Van Dalen Footwear
Brussels Commercial Court, 20 March 2014, Loubou-
tin v Van Dalen Footwear22. Based on its Benelux pos-
ition mark Louboutin ﬁled accelerated proceedings on
the merits against the Dutch company Van Dalen Foot-
wear BV before the President of the Brussels Commercial
Court, since Van Dalen commercialized high-heeled
shoes with red soles. Van Dalen ﬁled a counterclaim
seeking revocation of Louboutin’s trade mark.

Louboutin argued that its Benelux trade mark was a
colour mark that was used on a speciﬁc part of the shoes,
ie, positioned on the sole of high-heeled shoes. Although
the President acknowledged that trade mark protection
can be granted for colours per se or for a combination of
colours when those colours are able to distinguish the
goods from a company, she was not convinced that Lou-
boutin’s trade mark qualiﬁed as a colour mark. She con-
sidered that the qualiﬁcation as a colour mark required
that the trade mark application would clearly indicate
that registration of the colour per se is requested and
should not give the impression that it concerns a ﬁgura-
tive mark or a shape mark. The President inferred from
the depicted shoe and description given in the trade mark
register that Louboutin’s mark was in fact not a colour
mark but concerned a shape mark.

that Louboutin’s trade mark consisted of a shape having
the potential to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the consumer’s
behaviour, since the ‘sole of the Louboutin shoe consti-
tutes a very important feature for consumers’.

The President’s qualiﬁcation of Louboutin’s red sole
mark as shape mark is based on the depicted shoe and
the detailed description in the register as to where the
colour trade mark will be applied on the goods.
However, by giving such detailed information, Loubou-
tin effectively put into practice the CJEU’s teaching in
Libertel in showing how, in practice, the colour conveyed
information as to the origin due to the factual use that
had been made of the colour, ie, positioned on the sole
of the shoes. By giving this additional information, as
opposed to solely referring to the applied-for trade mark
as ‘red – Pantone 18-1663 TP’, anyone consulting the
trade mark register can more easily identify what pre-
cisely constitutes the registered trade mark rendering the
graphic representation of the sign more clear, precise,
self-contained and intelligible. It did, therefore, not
come as a surprise that Louboutin ﬁled an appeal against
this judgment.

Brussels Court of Appeal, 18 November 2014, Loubou-
tin v Van Dalen Footwear24. The Brussels Court of
Appeal overturned the ﬁrst instance judgment, conﬁrm-
ing ﬁrst that Louboutin had fulﬁlled the condition of
graphical representation, since it had not only men-
tioned the international colour code but also further
deﬁned the scope of protection very precisely by refer-
ring to the positioning of the colour on the soles of high-
heeled shoes together with an illustration thereof.

The court also clearly ruled out that the disputed trade
mark would be a shape trade mark and qualiﬁed it as a
ﬁgurative trade mark, an element of which was the colour.
The exclusion ground of shapes giving substantial value
to the goods was therefore not applicable. It is on this
point that the ﬁrst instance judgment is overturned.

As to the alleged lack of distinctiveness, the court held
that it was not established that shoes with red soles had
been commercialized in the Benelux countries prior to the
registration date of Louboutin’s trade mark and that in
any event, such shoes were remarkable precisely because
these did not represent the standard and normal appear-
ance of the sole of shoes in the trade, ie, shoes with brown
or black soles. Louboutin’s trade mark indeed identiﬁes
the origin of the shoes at issue, at least through his con-
stant and continuous use thereof.

Referring to the General Court’s decision in the Bang
& Olufsen pencil speakers case,23 the President decided

After having thus conﬁrmed the validity of Loubou-
tin’s trade mark, the court assessed the infringement and

ordered the cease-and-desist thereof, even in cases where
the soles of the Van Dalen shoes would have been col-
oured red only partially. The court ruled that such
partial colouring of the soles did not do away with the
infringement, since this could not be seen during normal
use of the shoes, ie, when a person is wearing the shoes.

Louboutin/Dr. Adams Footwear
Brussels Court of Appeal, 18 November 2014, Loubou-
tin v Dr. Adams Footwear25. In a judgment of the same
day as the Van Dalen judgment, the Brussels Court of
Appeal26 issued an injunction on the merits27 against
Dr. Adams Footwear which distributed red-soled shoes in
Belgium. In this case, Louboutin also relied on its Benelux
trade mark registration with respect to the red sole.

The judgment goes in the same sense as the judgment
in the Van Dalen case. The court did not accept the defen-
dant’s invalidity argumentation (based on the exclusion
ground of
‘shape conferring substantial value to the
product’) and granted the requested injunction based on
Art. 2.20.1.a Benelux Treaty for Intellectual Property (ie,
use of an identical sign for identical goods, affecting the
commercial origin function of the trade mark).

US
The few US decisions that the authors are aware of have
looked at Louboutin’s red sole mark as a colour mark.
This is clear from the considerations of the US courts in
the Yves Saint Laurent case, which is to the authors’
knowledge the only US case dealing with the red sole
mark.

Louboutin/Yves Saint Laurent
In the US, Louboutin was unsuccessful in its attempt to
obtain preliminary injunctive relief against
fashion
house Yves Saint Laurent’s (YSL) commercialization of
shoes that were red all over, ie, sole and upper part.

In particular the appellate court’s reasoning contains
an interesting theoretic discussion of the so-called ‘doc-
trine of functionality’ which serves a similar purpose
and has some overlap with the exclusion grounds for
shape marks as provided for in Art. 7(1)(e) CTMR/Art.
3(1)(e) Trade mark Directive, although its ﬁeld of appli-
cation seems broader and, for instance, also applies to
colour marks. Under this doctrine, a distinction is made
between ‘utilitarian functionality’ and ‘aesthetic func-
tionality’. Product features which are essential to the use

or purpose of the product or which affect the cost or
quality thereof are functional in the ‘utilitarian’ sense,
and cannot beneﬁt from trade mark protection. Orna-
mental features are aesthetically functional and hence
also illegible for trade mark protection if their protection
as a trade mark would hinder competition by limiting
the range of adequate alternative designs.

However, as reminded by the appellate court in the
YSL case, and contrary to the legal construction in Euro-
pean trade mark law, the aesthetic functionality test in
the US is not performed in the context of the assessment
of the validity (read: inherent or acquired distinctive-
ness) of a trade mark, but only at a later stage, in the
framework of a trade mark’s enforceability, hand in hand
with the assessment of the likelihood of consumer con-
fusion. It would have been interesting to see the US
Court of Appeals apply the aesthetic functionality test to
the red sole mark. However, it dismissed Louboutin’s
claim because there was no infringement and hence
there was no need for the court to analyse whether or
not the red sole is ‘functional’ (see below).

US District Court
for the Southern District of
New York, 10 August 201128. The ﬁrst instance judge in
the YSL case did not grant the requested preliminary in-
junction because it found that Louboutin’s red sole trade
mark as registered with the USPTO was likely not en-
forceable.

Relying on the doctrine of ‘aesthetic functionality’,
and (wrongly—in the view of the US Court of Appeals)
interpreting the Supreme Court’s ruling in the landmark
case of Qualitex,29 the District Court ruled that, in the
fashion industry, single-colour marks are inherently
‘functional’. According to the District Court, this analysis
is justiﬁed in light of the speciﬁc concerns of the fashion
industry, such as its dependency on colours, its suscepti-
bility of taste and the fact that it is subject to temporal
change. Comparing Louboutin’s use of the colour red
with a painter’s use of the colour blue for water, the Dis-
trict Court ruled that Louboutin’s claim would ‘cast a
red cloud’ over the entire fashion industry, ‘cramping
what other designers could do, while allowing Louboutin
to paint with a full palette’. The District Court was more-
over of the opinion that an important dimension of un-
certainty was attached to Louboutin’s US red sole trade
mark because this mark, as mentioned above, does not
identify the colour red by referring to the Pantone code.

ARTICLE

267

The District Court rejected Louboutin’s ‘back-up’ pro-
posal to draw a designated ‘forbidden’ range of shades of
red above and under Pantone No. 18-1663 TP because
that ‘would have the effect of appropriating more than a
dozen shades of red - and perhaps other colours as well’.
However, the US Court of Appeals thought differently.

US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 5 Septem-
ber 2012, Case No. 11-3303-cv30. The Court of Appeals
partially reformed the ﬁrst instance decision. The Court
of Appeals ﬁrst of all ruled that the District Court could
not lawfully decide that a single colour can never serve as
a trade mark in the fashion industry. The District Court
was said to have wrongly interpreted the Supreme
Court’s case law on colour marks which precisely forbids
applying a per se rule denying trade mark protection to a
single colour in a particular industrial context.

Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals seems to
qualify the red sole mark as a mere colour mark. The
Court of Appeals ﬁrst of all reminds the established
Supreme Court case law which, quite similar to the
CJEU’s case law on colour marks, says that although a
single colour, standing on its own, almost never is inher-
ently distinctive, it is certainly capable of acquiring ‘sec-
ondary meaning’, which is
for
distinctiveness acquired through use.

the US equivalent

Based on a fact-driven analysis taking into account
Louboutin’s advertising expenditures, the results of con-
sumer surveys and the extensive media coverage (very
similar to the assessment of acquired distinctiveness in
the sense of European trade mark law), the Court of
Appeals coincided with the District Court’s earlier
ﬁnding that Louboutin’s red sole mark had indeed
become a brand with worldwide recognition. However,
the Court of Appeals was of the opinion that this sec-
ondary meaning does not extend to uses of the red sole
where the sole does not contrast with the upper part of
the shoe, ie, when a red sole is used on a monochromatic
red shoe. The Court of Appeals therefore decided that
the protection conferred by Louboutin’s trade mark
should be conﬁned to situations where the red outsole
contrasts with the remainder of the shoe, and ordered
that the trade mark be amended in the trade mark regis-
ter so as to reﬂect this limitation.

This limitation of the scope of Louboutin’s trade
mark lead to a ﬁnding of non-infringement since the
challenged YSL shoes were monochrome red (ie, not
only the outsole but also the remainder of the shoes was

red) and hence did not display the required contrast. As
a consequence, the court did not further engage in asses-
sing the likelihood of confusion and whether or not the
red sole mark (as modiﬁed) is functional.

The Netherlands
The red sole position mark has also been tested in the
Netherlands,31 where the courts had to rule on Loubou-
tin’s request for a preliminary injunction and relief on
the merits against the Dutch shoe manufacturer Van
Haren, which commercialized pumps with a red sole
through a network of shops in the Netherlands as well as
online.

By judgment of 18 April 2013,32 the judge in The
Hague granted the preliminary injunction, but only in
relation to the Van Haren shoes having a black and blue
upper part. Probably in light of the US appellate court’s
decision in the YSL case, Louboutin wisely did not insist
obtaining an injunction against the Van Haren pumps
that were red all over.

The court ﬁrst addressed the prima facie validity of
Louboutin’s trade mark. Whereas the parties differed on
whether the red sole mark should be qualiﬁed as a mere
colour mark (position of Van Haren, which speculated
on the application on the strict criteria developed in the
Libertel case33) or as a ﬁgurative mark (position of Lou-
boutin), the judge emphasized (after having said that it
saw the red sole mark as a sign having aspects of a colour
mark and of a shape mark)—in line with the CJEU’s
ruling in X Technology Swiss34—that the qualiﬁcation of
the mark as belonging to either category of trade marks
does not matter in the assessment of the mark’s distinct-
ive character. What is relevant is whether the mark is in-
dependent of
it
designates. If this is not the case (ie, when the mark coin-
cides with (a part of) the product), then the criteria for
shape marks should apply, meaning that the sign only
has an inherent distinctive character when it signiﬁcantly
departs from the norms or customs in the sector. In the
case at hand, the court did not actually apply this test
because Louboutin had made it sufﬁciently plausible
that the red sole mark could beneﬁt from acquired dis-
tinctiveness. Because Louboutin’s use of the red sole is so
consistent throughout its entire collection, the court
rejected Van Haren’s argument that Louboutin’s use of
the red sole was a merely decorative use and that consu-
mers would not recognize it as an indication of origin.

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 4

Turning to the issue of infringement, the court subse-
quently held that Van Haren had prima facie infringed
Louboutin’s red sole mark in the sense of Art. 2.20, par.
1 b of the Benelux Treaty for Intellectual Property
(which is the Benelux provision corresponding to Art.
5.1(b) Trade mark Directive), given Van Haren’s nearly
identical application of a red sole for identical goods and
the risk of confusion resulting therefrom. The court
ruled that it is irrelevant that potential buyers will prob-
ably not be mistaken due to the different sales channels
and the different pricing (Louboutin shoes being much
more expensive and available only in a small number of
exclusive shops) because in any event there is a risk of
post-sale confusion.

Louboutin subsequently ﬁled proceedings aimed at
obtaining a permanent injunction and an order to com-
municate accounting information in order to calculate
the damages to be paid by Van Haren. These measures
were granted by the The Hague District Court in a judg-
ment of 17 July 2013, rendered by default against Van
Haren.35

Van Haren ﬁled an opposition against this default
judgment, arguing that Louboutin’s red sole mark is
invalid on several grounds, ﬁrst of all because it would
not meet the strict requirements applying to either
colour marks or shape marks and hence is devoid of dis-
tinctive character. Van Haren also argued that the red
sole mark is also devoid of distinctive character because
the use of a red sole is generally known in the fashion in-
dustry. Finally, obviously inspired by the judgment of
the Brussels Commercial Court of 20 March 2014 (see
above), Van Haren argued that Louboutin’s mark is
invalid because it confers substantial value to the
product in the sense of Art. 2.1 par. 1 of the Benelux
Treaty for Intellectual Property (the Benelux provision
corresponding to Art. 3.1(e)(iii) Trade mark Directive).

The court took note of the Belgian ﬁrst instance judg-
ment (later overturned in appeal) declaring Louboutin’s
trade mark invalid, but did not (and, given the appeal,
did not have to) recognize this judgment,
instead
making its own assessment on the validity of Loubou-
tin’s red sole mark.

In its judgment of 1 April 2014,36 the District Court
of The Hague ﬁrst of all rejected Van Haren’s argumenta-
tion that the red sole mark is a mere ﬁgurative mark con-
sisting of a red surface. Van Haren also argued that the
red sole mark is devoid of distinctive character and,
more speciﬁcally, that it does not meet the stringent

37 Crucial for the outcome of the litigation against Van Haren (since the

District Court already announced that Van Haren is guilty of infringement

requirements for colour marks and shape marks to have
an inherent distinctive character. However, the court did
not address the red sole mark’s inherent distinctive char-
acter because it was of the opinion that the mark has in
any event acquired distinctiveness through use. But the
question was whether this acquired distinctiveness could
‘save’ Louboutin’s red sole position mark because the
court agreed with Van Haren that the red sole of the Lou-
boutin shoes gives substantial value to the shoes. The
court decided so based on consumer surveys showing that
over half of the respondents who would consider buying
the shoe, would do so because of its appearance, which is
perceived as attractive. The court ruled that these con-
sumer surveys moreover allowed making a distinction
between the value of the product which is attached to the
red sole and the attractiveness of the product that follows
from the goodwill attached to Louboutin’s Benelux trade
mark. The authors ﬁnd it hard to understand how such a
distinction can be made, even though they are not privy
to the exhibits that were ﬁled in relation thereto.

In any event, having said that the red sole gives sub-
stantial value to the product, the court then addressed
the crucial37 issue of whether this brings into play the
relevant exclusion ground for shape marks. Van Haren
argued that it does because the trade mark coincides
with the shape of the product. Louboutin argued that it
does not because the trade mark does not exclusively
consist of a shape but also consists of a colour. Absent
clear guidance in the case law of the CJEU, the District
Court deemed it necessary to refer a preliminary ques-
tion to the CJEU. According to the District Court, in the
current state of play it is unclear ‘whether the notion
‘shape’ in the sense of Art. 3.1(e)(iii) Trade mark Direct-
ive is limited to three-dimensional characteristics of
(parts of) the product like the contours, sizes and
volume thereof (which can be expressed in three dimen-
sions), or whether it also covers other (non-three-di-
mensional) characteristics of the product such as colour’.
The text of the question is not yet ﬁnal since the parties
still have the opportunity to exchange trial briefs on the
exact formulation of the question. The formulation pro-
posed by the court is as follows: ‘Is the notion “shape” in
the sense of Art. 3.1.e.iii of the Trade mark Directive
limited to the three-dimensional properties of
the
product such as the contours, sizes and volume (which
can be expressed in three dimensions), or does it also
relate to other (not three-dimensional) characteristics of
the product such as colour)?’

Louboutin’s trade mark throughout Europe.

Carina Gommers and Eva De Pauw . ‘Red Sole Diaries’

ARTICLE

269

The reply to this question seems very important for the
fate of Louboutin’s trade mark in Europe. If the CJEU
were to rule that the exclusion ground applies to the red
sole mark, then it’s ‘red alert’ for Louboutin because the
application of this absolute refusal ground cannot be
avoided by proving acquired distinctiveness.

Although the District Court has indicated that applying
the exclusion ground to Louboutin’s mark seems to be in
line with the rationale underlying the exclusion ground,
the authors are of the opinion that this would seem unjust.
A pointer to the answer may already be included in
the new trade mark legislation, also referred to as the
‘Trade mark Package’. The new legal provisions38 extend
the traditional exclusion grounds for shape marks so as
to read as follows:

signs which consist exclusively of:
(i) the shape, or another characteristic, which results from the
nature of the goods themselves,
(ii) the shape, or another characteristic, of goods which is
necessary to obtain a technical result,
(iii) the shape, or another characteristic, which gives substan-
tial value to the goods.

Concluding remarks
If, as some courts have already suggested, the absolute
refusal ground of substantial value applies to the Lou-
boutin red sole trade mark, then Louboutin may not be
in a good position. The pending preliminary referral to
the CJEU seems almost decided beforehand taking into
account
the Trade mark
Package. In this worst-case scenario for Louboutin, the
acquired distinctiveness of its red sole mark (which we
think is undisputed) will not be able to bring any relief.

the legislative changes of

However, this result would in our opinion seem
unfair, since red shoe soles per se did in our opinion

originally not give substantial value to the shoes. It is in
our opinion only now, as an indication of origin and
due to the well-known character of Louboutin’s red
soles, that it gives substantial value to the shoes. One can
question whether this exclusion ground for shape marks
should not be simply abolished, or alternatively, whether
a distinction should be made between ‘inherent substan-
tial value’ and ‘acquired substantial value’. In cases where
the shape ‘or other characteristics’ give substantial value
to the goods from the very outset, it would seem reason-
able to apply the exclusion ground. In cases where the
shape ‘or other characteristics’ have gradually started to
confer substantial value to the goods as the products
became famous and gained a reputation, it would seem
unfair to deny trade mark protection.

Similar ideas can be found in the US case law cited by
the Court of Appeals in the YSL case, according to which
the application of the US doctrine of aesthetic function-
ality cannot lead to a situation where ‘the mark’s very
success in denoting (and promoting) its source (would)
itself defeat the markholder’s right to protect that mark’.
As recognized by the Court of Appeals, the problem is
that ‘aesthetic function and branding success can some-
times be difﬁcult to distinguish’. It is indeed a bit of a cir-
cular reasoning and, in line with the US Court in the
YSL case, the authors submit that European courts
should also be wary of an improvident application of the
exclusion ground of substantial value, and should ‘avoid
jumping to the conclusion that an aesthetic feature is
functional [authors’ note: in “Community legislation
wording”: that a shape confers substantial value to the
product] merely because it denotes the product’s desir-
able source’. The legal rationale of avoiding hindrances
to legitimate competition underlying the exclusion
grounds should indeed always be kept in mind.
