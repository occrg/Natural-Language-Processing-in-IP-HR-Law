‚ÄòTurn and face the strange‚Äô*‚Äîhow changes in
commercial circumstances determined the
outcomes in Scandecor and Starbucks (HK)
Neil Wilkof and Eleanor G. Wilson**

Introduction

‚ÄòWhen the facts change, I change my mind . . . What do
you do, sir?‚Äô

Whether uttered by John Maynard Keynes, Paul
Samuelson or another,2 the phrase has become part of
contemporary culture as a means for expressing that
when circumstances change, policy should take notice
and respond accordingly. But responding to such
changes is not simply the purview of economics; the
law and legal decision-making are also called upon to
confront them, be they commercial, technological or
otherwise. The challenge before the legislator or the
court is, however, somewhat different from that of the
social scientist, who constantly seeks to improve her
theory as an accurate explanation of the underlying
circumstances.

For the law, the importance of predictability is cen-
tral to the system. Not every change in the underlying
circumstances merits a corresponding modiÔ¨Åcation in
the law; neither, however, can they be simply ignored.
How the law deals with changing circumstances re-
quires a balance between stability and continuing
relevance.3

Intellectual property is not immune from this dy-
namic. The most salient example is copyright, which
emerged as a form of legal protection in response to the
development of technologies that enabled the mechani-
cal reproduction of contents, which in turn brought

 Scant attention has been given to how the law of trade marks

and other signs has responded to changing circumstances in
commerce and trade. For the law, the importance of predictabil-
ity is central to the system. The manner by which the law deals
with changing circumstances requires a balance between stability
and continuing relevance.

 It is recognized that changes in commerce are multi-faceted and of-

ten indirect, making it more difÔ¨Åcult to consider how these devel-
opments impact on the law of trade marks and passing off. Not
every change in underlying commercial circumstances merits a cor-
responding modiÔ¨Åcation in the law; neither, however, can they be
ignored. Notably, the House of Lords (as it then was) and later the
Supreme Court was twice called upon since the year 2000 to ad-
dress the issue of changing circumstances as a central consideration
in their rendering judgment, namely, the Scandecor case in 2001
and the Starbucks (HK) case in 2015, but it reached signiÔ¨Åcantly dif-
ferent outcomes. We argue that this divergence in outcome can be
explained by the fact that, in Scandecor, at issue was the interpreta-
tion of a newly enacted trade mark law, while in Starbucks (HK),
the case addressed a long-standing element of passing-off law.

 An understanding of the role of changing commercial circum-

stances discloses a hitherto underappreciated aspect of how basic
developments in the law of trade marks and commercial signs
depend upon the underlying legal framework.

about a fundamental change in the incentives for crea-
tion and the manner by which such contents could be
distributed commercially to the public.4 Such interac-
tion between changing circumstances and response by
the legal system continues to the present day. One need
only recall the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT), con-
cluded in 1996 and entered into force in 2002, a special
agreement under the Berne Convention that covers the
protection of works and the rights of their authors in
the digital environment.5

Patent law also witnessed the move from the grant of
letters patent, being merely a royal monopoly to engage
in a speciÔ¨Åc activity deemed desirable by the crown, to
a system that sought to incentivize inventors and pro-
vide a grant of right that was good against the world for
a Ô¨Åxed period of time.6 The very subject matter of in-
vention has required the law to address changes in tech-
nology and decide whether or not to confer patent
protection for a given type of invention.7

The use of trade marks over time also reÔ¨Çects changes
in the underlying commercial and technological circum-
stances. Both trade mark (and passing off) protection fo-
cuses on the manner by which marks are used in
commerce, but these dynamics are multi-faceted and of-
ten less direct, making it more difÔ¨Åcult to point to a sim-
ple cause and effect relationship. Commerce becomes
increasingly international and supply chains become ever
more elaborate, all this within the context of ever-
expanding digital connectivity. Accordingly, while it is
well-nigh impossible to point to a single factor that ac-
counts for fundamental changes in the way that com-
merce takes place,
it cannot be gainsaid that such
changes, over time, are palpable and substantial.

In contrast with other intellectual property rights,
however, scant attention has been given to how the law
governing trade marks and other commercial signs has
responded to such changing circumstances in trade and
commerce. This article seeks to address this lacuna by
considering two judgments, Scandecor Developments AB
v Scandecor Marketing AV (2001),8 by the United
Kingdom House of Lords, as it was then known, and

Starbucks (HK) Limited v British Sky Broadcasting
Group PLC, by the Supreme Court of
the United
Kingdom (2015).9 In both judgments, changes in the
manner of the use of marks in commerce were central,
but the respective courts, House of Lords (as it then
was) and the Supreme Court, each treated the impact
of such changes differently. Notably, the legal protec-
tion of marks and signs is characterized in common law
systems by the fact that there are both registration and
use-based rights, which allows us to compare and con-
trast how these two systems address the issue of chang-
ing circumstances.

In the Scandecor judgment, the House of Lords, in
the face of a new statutory scheme for trade marks, was
retrospectively seen as having treated changing com-
mercial circumstances as the foundation for following
the ‚Äòdirection of travel‚Äô10 to materially alter the law of
trade mark licensing, at least for the treatment of a bare
exclusive trade mark license. In the Starbucks (HK)
judgment, by contrast, while the Supreme Court gave
recognition to the changes wrought by global travel and
digital communication, it declined to take them into
account so as to amend the common law test for prov-
ing goodwill under the law of passing off

the

issue

in the

context of

We will argue that these differing results can be ex-
plained by the fact that the Scandecor decision consid-
ered the
statutory
construction of the (then) recent enactment of the
Trade Marks Act 1994, which conferred upon the court
greater Ô¨Çexibility to discard judicial principles regarding
trade mark licensing that had been developed under
previous statutory schemes. By contrast, the Starbucks
(HK) court evinced a demonstrable reluctance to alter a
basic legal principle that had long been in effect at com-
mon law, even in light of changing circumstances, de-
spite the fact that the court had within its power to
refashion the law should it see Ô¨Åt.

To circle back to the original question: ‚ÄòWhen the
facts change, I change my mind . . . What do you do,
sir?‚Äô It would seem that for judges, unlike economists,
the answer is, ‚Äòit depends‚Äô.

produce multiple copies of contents was more than a century of regal
regulation and even censorship, together with internal regulation by the
printing guild. Statutory protection came only later, at the beginning of
the eighteenth century. See Bracha, Owning Ideas: The Intellectual Origins

The Scandecor case‚Äînew statute,
new law
The hyper-complicated factual background to the dis-
pute can be summarized thusly. The founders had
jointly founded a company in Sweden in the 1960s for
the sale of art posters and related products. Each of
them assumed sales responsibility for distinct national
territories. Inter alia, local subsidiaries had been estab-
lished to serve as distributors. Two trade marks had
been registered in the UK, each in the name of a differ-
ent corporate entity. Thereafter, one of the marks was
assigned, without goodwill, to the other company. After
a tortured series of transactions, one of the surviving
parties sued the other for trade mark infringement; the
defendant in turn counterclaimed for revocation, on
the ground that the sued-upon mark was no longer
distinctive.

The question at issue was the legal status of the quality
control requirement with respect to a trade mark license.
Under the previous law (the Trade Mark Acts 1938), a
recordal system for trade mark licenses had been in place,
but under the new act, registration of a license is only for
purposes of notice and right of suit. At issue was the sta-
tus of (at least) a ‚Äòbare license‚Äô, that is, a license where no
quality control of the licensee‚Äôs use of the mark, was in
place, namely whether a mark under such circumstances
could still serve as an indication of source.11

To answer this question, the House of Lords centred
on the meaning of ‚Äòorigin‚Äô in the context of a trade
mark license. A bedrock principle underlying trade
mark law is that a trade mark is a badge of origin; if use
of a mark does not serve to indicate origin, the mark is
no longer distinctive of the goods or services to which
it is being applied.12 As applied to a trade mark license,
the question was whether, ‚Äò. . .if a mark belongs to X
but with X‚Äôs consent it is used in relations to the goods
of Y, over which X has no quality control, the mark
ceased to be distinctive‚Äô
for the
Respondent described] ‚Äòas the ‚Äúgolden thread‚Äù running
through the law relating to registered trade marks‚Äô).13
To decide this question, the court sought to determine
whether the ‚Äògolden thread‚Äô was still applicable under
the Trade Marks Act 1994. The approach applied by the
House of Lords was to trace the historical development

. . . [what counsel

of trade mark law, with particular attention to the treat-
ment of the legal position of licensing, against the back-
drop of changes
that
licensing has been carried out.14

in the commercial manner

Changing circumstances and the early
common law judgments

The starting point of the judgment is the role of marks
in the context of the changing manner of commerce.
Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead writes that:

. . . the manner in which business activities are carried on
today is vastly different from what it was in the early 19th
century when the law relating to trade marks was Ô¨Årst de-
veloped. Labour is more mobile, business enterprises are
larger and less personal, businesses and parts of businesses
change hands more often. With the growth of mass mar-
kets and intensive advertising many brand names have be-
come very valuable. In this image-conscious age trade
marks are an important marketing tool. Licensing has be-
come commonplace.15

The court then states that: ‚Äò[t]he law relating to trade
marks has responded to these changing conditions‚Äô16
and that ‚Äòthese changes‚Äô17 lie at the heart of the legal is-
sue on appeal.

Thus, according to the court, until the beginning of
the nineteenth century, the right enjoyed by the propri-
etor of a mark was personal in nature, conferring pro-
tection under the common law doctrine of passing off
against deception as the origin of the goods. Over time,
however, traders were not content simply to enjoy legal
protection against deception as to the source of their
goods; they also sought to explore the possibility of sell-
ing their marks. By the end of the nineteenth century,
courts at common law came to accept this form of
transaction by giving recognition to a mark as a form
of property, whereby sale of the mark was permitted,
subject to various legal restrictions to prevent deception
as to origin. It was no longer required that the precise
identity of the origin of the mark be known. All that
the mark needed to represent was ‚Äòthat the goods were
manufactured in the course of the business using the
mark. . .. .‚Äô18

Accordingly, the right to transfer the mark was rec-
ognized, provided that the transfer was accompanied by

the sale of the business in respect of which the mark
was used.19

history in this way within the context of judicial deci-
sion making?

The court states that a similar approach was taken
regarding licenses. Referring to the judgment given in
1894 in the case of Thorneloe v Hill,20 the court noted
that:

Romer J had no difÔ¨Åculty in deciding that, consistently
with the prohibition on the assignment of a mark sepa-
rately from the business in which the mark was used, there
could be no grant of a licence to use a mark separately
from the licensor‚Äôs business. . . .. When the licence expired
the licensors had lost any right they previously had to say
that any person marketing ‚ÄòJohn Forrest‚Äô watches thereby
referred to watches manufactured by them.21

The court observed that the legal recognition of the
transfer of trade marks as a form of property took place
in lock-step with commercial changes regarding trans-
actions in trade marks, stating that:

[t]his approach accords with business reality and cus-
tomers‚Äô everyday expectations. Customers realise there is
always the prospect that, unbeknown to them, the manage-
ment of a business may change. To conÔ¨Åne the use of a
trade mark to the original owner of a business would be to
give the concept of a business origin or business source an
unrealistically narrow and impractical meaning.22

All of the foregoing judicial pronouncements took place
within the framework of the common law, where the
resolution of private disputes gives rise to judicially cre-
ated legal principles. With respect the development of
legal protection of marks from a private to a personal
right, the court does not suggest that the common law
had engaged in reconceptualizing the legal position, but
rather recognized that commercial circumstances had
changed, warranting a corresponding change in the le-
gal position. Indeed, the failure to do so would have re-
sulted, as stated,23 in an ‚Äòunrealistically narrow and
impractical meaning‚Äô for trade mark rights.

A word about the nature of the court‚Äôs approach
with respect to these changing commercial circum-
stances. The court does not offer a sustained historical
narrative; no sources or other authority (other than,
presumably, the fact situations at issue before the courts
in the various judgments) are given in support of the
court‚Äôs assertions about changing commercial circum-
stances in their historical context. Still, it can be asked:
what is the nature of the court‚Äôs competency to treat

One might be tempted to describe its broad-stroke
historical characterizations as a form of judicial notice,
which has been deÔ¨Åned as follows:

A court will take judicial notice of facts that are of such
common knowledge that to require proof of them would
be absurd, such as the meaning of ordinary words. Unless
an Act expressly provides otherwise, the court takes judicial
notice of Acts of Parliament.24

Given the contentious nature of historical analysis,
however, with agreement seldom reached, reliance on
‚Äòjudicial notice‚Äô within the meaning set forth above
seems misplaced. Having regard to what appears to
have been consensus among the Law Lords on this his-
torical narrative,
it is perhaps possible to place the
court‚Äôs historical gloss within a rhetorical, rather than a
historiographic, context. As observed by Lepore herself
an historian,
‚ÄòHistory written to win a legal argument
has a different claim to authority than history written
to Ô¨Ånd out what happened.‚Äô25

Here, the competency upon which the historical
gloss rests is in the realm of persuasion rather than any
inquiry into the historical facts qua facts. Query, how-
ever, what might be the impact if a counter-consensus
is one day reached about these historical facts or, at the
least, a substantial challenge is mounted to this histori-
cal narrative? At what point might the rhetorical use of
history in such circumstances be forced to give way to
the revisionist view of the underlying historiography?
No ready answer suggests itself. Be that as it may, for
purposes of considering the judgment, the facts and cir-
cumstances discussed are accepted.

The early Trade Marks Acts

In a roughly parallel fashion to these common law de-
velopments, beginning in 1875, Parliament enacted a
series of
laws for the statutory protection of trade
marks, with no attention paid to licenses as part of
these enactments. Thus, neither
the Trade Marks
Registration Act 1875 nor the Patents, Designs and
Trade Marks Act 1883 addressed the issue. Moving for-
ward, not only did the Trade Marks Act 1905 make no
mention of licensing, but the deÔ¨Ånition of a ‚Äòtrade
mark‚Äô under the Act ‚Äòeffectively negatived the possibility
of licensing.‚Äô26 This was because a mark as deÔ¨Åned had

to ‚Äòindicat[e] that they are goods of the proprietor of
the mark. . ..‚Äô,27 which was incompatible with trade
mark licensing, where the goods came from the licensee
and not the proprietor. In the context of these early
statutes, the court does not point to any attention
drawn by Parliament to the commercial practice of li-
censing of the time. These statutes contain nary a word
about
licensing, whatever commercial practice may
have been in place at that time.

The Trade Marks Act 193828 worked a major change
in the legislative treatment of licensing in light of a rec-
ognition of changing commercial circumstances. In the
words of the court, ‚Äò[c]ontemporary commercial devel-
opments had made some legal recognition of the prac-
tice of licensing trade marks desirable.‚Äô29 There were
two major components to the statutory treatment ac-
corded trade mark licensing.

First, ‚Äòtrade mark‚Äô was deÔ¨Åned to mean a mark used
with respect to goods that ‚Äòindicat[ed] a connection in
the course of trade‚Äô between the goods and a person
having a right of use, either the proprietor or the so-
called registered user.30 The notion of ‚Äòa connection in
the course of trade‚Äô was construed to mean that the
licensor had to exercise quality control over the licen-
see31 (para 30] and ‚Äòsource‚Äô did not necessarily mean
the licensor/proprietor.32 Second, to give effect to this
understanding of ‚Äòsource‚Äô within the context of licens-
ing, a recordal system was put into place, whereby the
degree of control over the licensee‚Äôs use of the mark
constituted one factor to be taken into account.33 Thus,
the explicit treatment of licenses in the 1938 Act could
be seen as moving in lock-step with changes that had
taken place in commercial practice with respect to the
use of marks.

However, the lock-step between statutory develop-
ments and continuing commercial developments with
respect to the use of marks stalled. Most notably, the
court brieÔ¨Çy mentions34 the 1984 decision of the House
of Lords in the so-called Holly Hobbie35 case to point to
the disjunction between the legal position under the

licensing practice, namely character merchandising. The
court upheld the refusal to register a mark, in the form
of the name and likeness of an imaginary young girl, in
multiple classes for a wide variety of goods, that is, the
merchandising of the mark. The court in Holly Hobbie
held that the applications fell afoul of section 28(6) of
the 1938 Trade Marks Act, which prevented ‚ÄòtrafÔ¨Åcking‚Äô
of marks.36 It did not matter that the applicant had es-
tablished some quality control provisions (described by
the court as ‚Äòslight‚Äô) to try to overcome the prohibition
against trafÔ¨Åcking. This decision put into bas relief the
tension deriving from the adherence by the House of
Lords to the express provisions of the 1938 Trade
Marks Act, despite the court‚Äôs understanding of prevail-
ing commercial practice. On the one hand, with respect
to the proper construction of what constitutes trafÔ¨Åck-
ing, Lord Brightman stated as follows: ‚Äò[I]f a commer-
cial activity such as that falling to be considered by
your Lordships in the instant case is not trafÔ¨Åcking in a
trade mark, what is?‚Äô37

Lord Bridge, however, while concurring with the re-
sult, observed that the result reached was a ‚Äòcomplete
anachronism . . . [c]haracter merchandising deceives
nobody.‚Äô38 Lord Bridge recommended parliamentary
repeal of this provision. The upshot is that by the
1980s, the House of Lords had expressed a recognition
that the trade mark legislation in place was not sufÔ¨Å-
ciently aligned with changing commercial practice, but
the House of Lords did not Ô¨Ånd authority in the 1938
Act to enable it to give legal effect to these changes.

It was against this background that the House of
Lords in the Scandecor case considered whether, under
the 1994 Trade Mark Act,39 a bare exclusive license fell
afoul of the requirement that a trade mark as being de-
ceptive as an indication of the source of the goods. In
ruling that the answer is that a bare exclusive license
was not deceptive, the court relied on two principal fac-
tors: (i) the meaning of ‚Äòtrade mark‚Äô under the 1994
Act and (ii) the changing commercial circumstances in
which trade mark licensing is now taking place. These
two considerations are complementary.

36 Notably, no single understanding of ‚ÄòtrafÔ¨Åcking‚Äô was reached, and three
different deÔ¨Ånitions were offered during the course of the proceedings.

As for the meaning of a ‚Äòtrade mark‚Äô, the deÔ¨Ånition
under section 1(1) the 1994 Act covers ‚Äò. . . any sign ca-
pable of being represented graphically which is capable
of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking
from those of other undertakings.‚Äô In the words of the
court, ‚Äò[i]nherent in this deÔ¨Ånition is the notion that
distinctiveness as to business source (the ‚Äúgoods of one
undertaking‚Äù) is the essential function of a trade mark
today.‚Äô40 The court asks whether the proper meaning of
‚Äòbusiness source‚Äô is the proprietor of the mark or the
party entitled to use the mark, whether it may be the
proprietor or the licensee. The court preferred the un-
derstanding whereby business source means the party
entitled to use the mark at any particular moment of
time.41

Integral to the court‚Äôs result is its understanding of
the current commercial circumstances characterizing
the practice of trade mark licensing.

First, considering the deÔ¨Ånition of ‚Äòtrade mark‚Äô, the

court asks:

‚Äò[w]hat is the message which a trade mark conveys today?
What does a trade mark denote? It denotes that goods
bearing the mark come from one business source . . ..‚Äô42

Second, the court supports its conclusion that ‚Äòbusiness
source‚Äô may either be the proprietor of the mark, or the
exclusive licensee, as follows:

Customers are well used to the practice of licensing of trade
marks. When they see goods to which a mark has been af-
Ô¨Åxed, they understand that the goods have been produced
either by the owner of the mark or by someone else acting
with his consent.43

Third, the court explains how its understanding is con-
sistent with the protection that a trade mark is meant
to accord consumers. The court states:

For quality assurance customers rely on the self-interest of
the owner. They assume that if a license has been granted
the owner can be expected to have chosen a suitable license
and imposed suitable terms. They also assume that during
the currency of any license the licensee, as well as the

tation from the paper, ‚ÄòReform of Trade Marks Law‚Äô, issued by the
Department of Trade and Industry, September 1990 (Cm 1203), para
4.36:
Whatever may have been the position in 1938, the public is now accus-
tomed to goods or services being supplied under licence from the trade
mark owner. For example there has been the growth of franchise opera-
tions. The potential for deception is therefore less. Moreover the stron-
gest guarantee that a proprietor will maintain control over the way in
which his trade mark is used is that it is in his own interest to do so. A
trade mark is a valuable piece of property, in terms both of its power to

owner, is likely to have an interest in maintaining the value
of the brand name.44

The court thereby joins these statutory and commercial
considerations in rejecting the continuing validity of
the golden thread, concluding as follows:

Some of those who have spent their entire lives under the
regime of the 1938 Act, may consider that this view of the
matter is distressingly heretical. They would be mistaken. It
is no more than a consequence Ô¨Çowing from the 1994 Act
having freed the law of registered trade marks from the
straightjacket imposed by the statutory deÔ¨Ånitions of a
trade mark in the 1905 Act and then the 1938 Act. Freed
from that constraint, the law can now catch up with busi-
ness practice.45

The upshot is that the changes to the trade mark law
under the 1994 Trade Mark Act had managed to bring
the treatment of (at least) a bare exclusive license into
alignment with changes in commercial practice. The
treatment of other forms of trade mark license were left
unaddressed and questions were raised to what extent
the decision applied more generally.46 In any event, the
House of Lords referred a series of questions to the

The role of changing circumstances

The message conveyed by the Scandecor court regarding
the role of changing commercial circumstances and the
development of trade mark law, and, in particular, the
law of licensing, is unequivocal. Being a creature of
commerce, the law must follow the commercial path(s)
taken. Changes in the latter warrant modiÔ¨Åcations to
the former. The result is a unique legal mixture of
time-honoured basic principles, such as the source
identiÔ¨Åcation function of a trade mark, on the one
hand, and relentless modiÔ¨Åcations in to speciÔ¨Åc aspects
of the trade mark law system in response to changing
commercial circumstances, on the other.

attract customers and of the royalties which can be demanded from li-
censees. Its value is however ultimately dependent on its reputation with
the public. If the proprietor tolerates uncontrolled use of his trade mark
the value of this property will be diminished. In an extreme case the reg-
istration of the mark may become liable to be revoked if it has become
deceptive or generic through such use. It is however the responsibility of
the proprietor, not the Registrar, to prevent the devaluation of his own
property.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2018, Vol. 13, No. 1

Against this broad-brush background, certain factors
speciÔ¨Åc to the Scandecor case also helped to fashion the
court‚Äôs approach to changing commercial circum-
stances. First, perhaps paradoxically, the fact that the
court was confronted with a new statute, dealing with a
statutory subject matter reaching back more than one
hundred years, provided the court with greater freedom
in its statutory construction. This is especially so, be-
cause the new statute had not yet been the subject of
substantial judicial construction.

Indeed, the enactment of the new Trade Marks Act
created not only the opportunity, but the obligation to
construe the new statute in order to reÔ¨Çect the updated
legislative intention which underpinned it.49 Moreover,
the new law created a framework which could be used
by the court to justify an interpretation of the Act,
which reÔ¨Çected the commercial sophistication of the
parties and the agreements they had in place. Against
this backdrop, changing commercial circumstances was
clearly a driver of this interpretation.50

As well, the court beneÔ¨Åted from being able to com-
pare and contrast related provisions in previous statutes
and judgments, without however being bound by them.
As such, together with its showing that changed com-
mercial circumstances has been a long-serving element
in law-making in this area, enabled the court to success-
fully parry a challenge that its decision would under-
mine legal predictability and stability. Further, the local
nature of a statute, which has no precise analog in any
other jurisdiction, eases the burden of the court to con-
sider the legal position elsewhere.

Having regard to the multi-layered provenance of the
law regarding trade mark licensing, Bennison‚Äôs metaphor
of the ‚ÄòÔ¨Çoor and rug‚Äô for understanding the nature of the
current law, is apt. The Ô¨Çoor is the unwritten law, pri-
marily the common law, while the rug is the current stat-
utory enactment, which conceals (at least in part) this

unwritten law.51 More speciÔ¨Åcally, the court‚Äôs interpreta-
tion of the relevant sections of the 1994 Act is grounded
on both judge-made and statutory enactments spanning
several centuries. Several rules of legal interpretation are
noteworthy in this regard.

Concerning the relationship between the common
law position and its later effect in a statutory enact-
ment, the basic principle is as follows:

Acts may abolish unwritten rules, or may amend them. Or
an Act may take over from the previous unwritten law and
provide instead an enacted version of the old rule, with or
without amendment.52

Concerning successive revisions of the trade mark law,
most notably for our purposes the 1938 Act and the
1994 Act, the rule of interpretation is as follows:

An operative Act, as the expression of the will of the sover-
eign legislature, overrides inconsistent provisions of pre-
existing law (whether statutory or not) and is itself overrid-
den by any inconsistent subsequent Act.53

As for implied amendments:

Where a later enactment does not expressly amend
(whether textually or indirectly) an earlier enactment
which it has power to override, but the provisions of the
later enactment are inconsistent with those of the earlier,
the later by implication amends the earlier so far as is nec-
essary to remove the inconsistency between them.54

Seen in this way, one can make two observations. First,
judgments of the Law Lords make full use of these rules
in reaching their decision. Second, there is nothing in
the judgment of the Law Lords that can be said to devi-
ate from these rules. The developments in the applica-
ble

49 The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Technology (Mr. Patrick

McLoughlin) expressed this as follows:
the Bill deregulates in a number of ways. In particular, the procedures for
the registration of assignments and licences of trade marks, which are
also dealt with in part I, will be much simpliÔ¨Åed. The current law requires
the registrar to fulÔ¨Ål a kind of consumer protection role. That is an old-
fashioned notion. Other bodies and modern legislation can do that job
far more effectively. Customers are far more sophisticated than they were
in 1938, when the current trade mark law was enacted. HC Deb 18 April

51 The full expression of Bennion‚Äôs Ô¨Çoor and rug metaphor is as follows:

To describe the way Acts operate on existing law one can use the image
of a Ô¨Çoor upon which rugs are spread. The Ô¨Çoor consists of unwritten
law or lex non scripta, in other words common law, rules of equity, and

customary rules. An Act is like a rug laid down on this Ô¨Çoor. The Act
conceals, for the area it covers, the texture underneath. That texture be-
comes visible again if the rug is later removed, that is the Act is repealed.
This is the position at common law. It is by statute considerably modi-
Ô¨Åed, so that repeal does not revive a common law rule. An Act lying as it
were on the Ô¨Çoor of unwritten law may in time itself be overlaid. When
later on another rug is put down (that is a further Act on the subject is
passed), any portion of existing law it covers is pro tanto blocked out. In
ordinary language, a later Act overrides inconsistent earlier Acts. So far as
it is not tailored to repeal or amend these expressly, the later Act does so
by implication.

The decision in Starbucks (HK) v British
Sky Broadcasting Group

As set out above, the House of Lords in the Scandecor
case were prepared to view the relevant provisions of
the Trade Marks 1994 in a way that was expressly alive
to the dynamic commercial environment and changing
circumstances surrounding the disputed use of
the
marks. In the case of Starbucks (HK) v British Sky
Broadcasting Group,55 however the Supreme Court de-
clined to develop the law in the manner urged by one

The case of Starbucks (HK) v BSB

The claimants, Starbucks (HK) and PCCW Media Ltd
(together a group referred to as PCCM), operated an
internet protocol television (IPTV) service in Hong
Kong with over one million subscribers, with the name
‚ÄòNOW TV‚Äô. They were seeking to prevent British Sky
Broadcasting Group (Sky) from launching their own
IPTV network within the UK under the same name, al-
leging passing off. PCCM had been considering expan-
sion to the UK and taken various steps to deliver
channels outside of Hong Kong. In particular, since
2007, the Chinese content was available free of charge
on PCCM‚Äôs website, via YouTube, and on-demand on
international airlines, and a NOW TV app was
launched in 2012 in the UK.

The question before the court was whether it is pos-
sible for the claimant to bring a passing off action based
on a reputation among a signiÔ¨Åcant section of the pub-
lic, or whether it is still necessary to demonstrate actual
business and customers within the jurisdiction. As Lord
Neuberger observed, introducing the judgment, ‚Äò[i]t is

for the modern incarnation of the passing off claim

they can be summarized as goodwill plus misrepresen-
tation plus damage equals passing off. It is the meaning

In a

Saint
Augustine‚Äôs difÔ¨Åculty with ‚Äòtime‚Äô,59 Lord Macnaghten
said, ‚ÄòWhat is goodwill? It is a thing very easy to de-
scribe, very difÔ¨Åcult to deÔ¨Åne. It is the beneÔ¨Åt and ad-
vantage of the good name, reputation and connection
of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in
custom.‚Äô60 It was goodwill and in particular the territo-
rial character of goodwill which was the determinative
and most difÔ¨Åcult factor in the Starbucks case.

reminiscent of

judgment

almost

In the High Court, Arnold J had said ‚Äòthe key ques-
tion is whether the viewers of PCCM‚Äôs programmes in
the UK were customers for its service so as to give rise
to a protectable goodwill in the UK.‚Äô61 In the Supreme
Court, emphasis was placed on the international repu-
tational element of the claimed goodwill and its salience
in this age of international e-commerce. In terms of
what customers understand, customers and confusion
are central to a passing off action; it is they who create
the value in goodwill, to them the misrepresentation is
addressed and by their behaviour commercial damage
can be caused.

The Supreme Court judgment
When the case reached the Supreme Court, PCCM ar-
gued that:

[P]articularly in an age of global electronic communication
and relatively quick and cheap travel, it is inconsistent with
commercial reality and unrealistic in terms of practicality
to treat the ‚Äòreputation or goodwill‚Äô associated with a mark
for a particular product or service as limited to jurisdic-
tions in which there is a business with customers for the
product or service, and incapable of extending to jurisdic-
tions in which the mark is simply associated with the par-
ticular product or service as a matter of reputation.62

The challenge mounted against the prevailing common
law test was based on two interrelated grounds. First,
PCCM contended that reliance on a bright-line legal
test was inappropriate, because ‚Äòthe question of where

the claimant had goodwill was a matter of fact and evi-
dence, not a matter of law.‚Äô63 In support of this posi-
tion, PCCM pointed to the nature of modern travel
and communications, stating that in our present age of:

. . . international trade and the presence of the internet . . .
it would be anachronistic and unjust if there was no right
to bring passing off proceedings, particularly in relation to
an electronically communicated service, in a jurisdiction
where, as a matter of law, the plaintiff‚Äôs mark had acquired
a reputation.64

PCCM elaborated on the importance of the changed
circumstances as a central ground to alter the alleged
common law test as follows:

. . . [P]articularly in an age of global electronic communica-
tion and relatively quick and cheap travel, it is consistent
with commercial reality and unrealistic in terms of practi-
cality to treat the reputation or goodwill‚Äù associated with a
mark for a particular product or service as limited to juris-
dictions in which there is a business with customers for the
product or service, and incapable of extending to jurisdic-
tions in which the mark is simply associated with a particu-
lar product or service as a matter of reputation.65

On that basis, the appellants relied on a three-prong at-
tack to the alleged common law test for goodwill: reli-
ance on certain judgments of English courts; reliance
on certain judgments by courts in other common law
jurisdictions, ‚Äòand the economic and practical realities
of the early 21st century‚Äô.66

The Supreme Court disposed of the question of the
legal position under UK case law without attributing to
the issue of changing commercial circumstances special
signiÔ¨Åcance in reaching the result. Describing the UK
position as the ‚Äòhardline approach‚Äô, the court stated that:

. . . it does appear that the courts in the United Kingdom
have consistently held that for a claimant to have goodwill,
in the sense of a customer basis, in this jurisdiction . . .
[T]his has been the consistent theme in the cases. . .67

The treatment of selected judgments from other com-
mon law jurisdictions (Ireland, Canada, New Zealand,
Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore) by contrast, was
less single-minded. The justiÔ¨Åcation given by the court
to consider judgments from these non-UK jurisdictions
was expressed as follows:

In addition to domestic cases, it is both important and
helpful to consider how the law has developed in other

common law jurisdictions‚Äîimportant because it is desir-
able that the common law jurisdictions have a consistent
approach, and helpful because every national common law
judiciary can beneÔ¨Åt from the experiences and thoughts of
other common law judges.68

As for whether or not these judgments pointed to a sin-
gle position, the court‚Äôs view was that it did not. As
Justice Neuberger observed, ‚Äò. . . it does not appear to
me that there is anything like a clear trend in the
common law courts outside the UK away from the
‚Äòhardline‚Äô approach manifested in the UK cases dis-
cussed . . .. Above.‚Äô69 Perhaps the diversity of results in
these various judgments was sufÔ¨Åcient to conclude that,
taken together, they did not support a change in the le-
gal position. But having regard to the fact that the court
itself stated that there was potential value in considering
‚Äòthe experiences and thoughts of other common law
judges‚Äô, attention to the reasoning of these judgments
was also warranted.

The most notable challenge to the UK ‚Äòhardline ap-
proach‚Äô was found in the Australian case, ConAgra Inc v
McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd.70 In surveying the posi-
tion under common law authorities, the court in that
case concluded that it was:

‚Äòno longer valid, if it ever was, to speak of a business
having goodwill or reputation only where the business
is carried on‚Äô, relying on ‚Äò[m]odern mass advertising
. . . [which] reaches people in many countries of the
world‚Äô, ‚Äò[t]he international mobility of the world popu-
lation‚Äô and the fact that ‚Äò[t]his is an age of enormous
commercial enterprises.‚Äô71

The ConAgra court was of the view that ‚Äòthe ‚Äúhard
line‚Äù cases in England conÔ¨Çict with the needs of con-
temporary business and international commerce.‚Äô The
court went on to state that ‚Äòit is not necessary . . . that a
plaintiff, in order to maintain a passing off action, must
have a place of business or a business presence in
Australia; nor is it necessary that his goods are sold
here.‚Äô72 Indeed, the court speciÔ¨Åcally referred to televi-
sion as a persuasive factor undermining the traditional
view that goodwill should be localized. The court stated
that it would be ‚ÄòsufÔ¨Åcient if his goods have a reputa-
tion in this country among persons here, whether resi-
dents or otherwise.‚Äô73

communication, would seem to have posed a direct
challenge to the UK common law rule. But it was not
enough to convince the Supreme Court to alter it. At a
technical level, the court could point to the fact that the
ConAgra case ultimately failed, because the plaintiff did
not succeed in proving reputation in Australia and that
the legal question raised has not been considered by the
High Court of Australia.

But what about the reasoning of the ConAgra court
itself, resting squarely on changed commercial circum-
stances? In a word, it was good enough to convince the
ConAgra court to jettison the then common law rule in
Australia regarding the test for proving goodwill, but
not sufÔ¨Åcient to convince the Supreme Court. Why?
The court laid out the countervailing legal forces push-
ing ‚Äòfor‚Äô and ‚Äòagainst‚Äô changing the existing common
law rule as follows:

It is of course open to this court to develop or even to
change the law in relation to a common law principle,
when it has become archaic or unsuited to current prac-
tices or beliefs. Indeed it is one of the great virtues of the
common law that it can adapt itself to practical and com-
mercial realities, which is particularly important in a world
which is fast changing in terms of electronic processes,
travel and societal values. Nonetheless, we should bear in
mind that changing the common law sometimes risks
undermining legal certainty, both because a change in itself
can sometimes generate uncertainty and because change
can sometimes lead to other actual or suggested conse-
quential changes.74

The court provides limited reasons why the ‚Äòrisks‚Äô to
‚Äòlegal certainty‚Äô,
leading to ‚Äòuncertainty‚Äô and ‚Äòconse-
quential changes‚Äô, outweigh demonstrably accepted
changes in commercial practices resulting from various
technological and social factors.

First, on factual grounds, the appellant could not es-
tablish that it had acquired reputation in the UK.75
Second, even if proof of mere reputation in the UK
could be shown, to hold that it would be sufÔ¨Åcient un-
der the UK law of passing off would tip the balance be-
tween protection of free competition, on the one hand,
and the prevention of unfair competition, on the other,
too much in favour of the latter.76 The reason is that

Starbucks (HK), supra, n. 56, at para 49. The observation that legal
change may lead to uncertainty and further change would seem to set an
extremely high bar, bordering on jurisprudential paralysis, to support
changes to common law rules, since seldom are certainty and statis the
likely result of a change to a law or legal rule. In any event and not unlike
the decision in the Scandecor case, the court (UKSC) here, as well, pro-
vides no evidentiary support for its characterization of changing ‚Äòcom-
mercial realities‚Äô.

without any customers, business or building a local
market, would provide the foundation for preventing
other traders from a legitimate right to use the mark in
the UK.77

In other words, changing the common law on the
basis of changing circumstances would contribute to a
set of undesirable outcomes. On that basis, such chang-
ing circumstances cannot serve as the basis for altering
the existing common law rule. This balancing best be-
tween free competition and unfair competition is not
part of the test for determining whether passing off has
occurred. However, it appears to have become part of
the analysis ‚Äòfor‚Äô and ‚Äòagainst‚Äô a change to the common
law rule as the court‚Äôs way of considering the conse-
quences of such a change.

Changing circumstances, differing results: further
thoughts on Starbucks (HK)
It is noteworthy to consider more generally the result in
the Starbucks (HK) case in light of what we have termed
‚Äòchanged commercial circumstances‚Äô.

The challenge is to interpret precedent set by distin-
guishing those facts against the backdrop of the gener-
ally applicable common law. By generating new fact-
speciÔ¨Åc precedents in tension with one another, judges
add information to precedent, which ultimately should
improve the precision of common law rules. Yet, this
increased precision is unattainable without the degree
of uncertainty and perhaps even unfairness that led to
the law being distinguished in the Ô¨Årst place.

For those who value free-market law-making, com-
mon law is adaptable and allows for Ô¨Çexibility; from the
legal realist perspective, that judges make laws based on
their own political beliefs, it is still seen as beneÔ¨Åcial for
the law to be developed in this way; from an economic
perspective, it is generally believed and assumed that
the common law is efÔ¨Åcient.78

This is, however, not always entirely apparent. A the-
oretical study found that the conditions allowing for ac-
tual efÔ¨Åciency within judge-made law were ‚Äòimplausibly
stringent‚Äô. The authors suggested that ‚Äò[t]he law better
adapts to the underlying transactions‚Äô‚Äîand, by exten-
sion, to new circumstances‚Äî‚Äòwhen activist judges dis-
tinguish cases‚Äô,79 or deliberately deviate from existing

common law by identifying properties of the case be-
fore them that justify not following the precedent. This
is subject to the ‚Äòright‚Äô set of facts coming along; it can-
not be conducted in a vacuum.80

In Starbucks (HK), the Supreme Court did not see Ô¨Åt
to interpret the common law in a novel way, even in re-
sponse to the changing commercial circumstances that
itself clearly acknowledged, nor even to amend the
common law at the same behest. Perhaps consideration
of judicial decision-making and the inÔ¨Çuence of foreign
case law will help illuminate the court‚Äôs reasoning.

Judicial decision-making in the Supreme Court
In the months before the Starbucks (HK) decision, Lord
Neuberger gave a lecture on the subject of judicial deci-
sion-making.81 Comparing it to starting from the centre
of a maze, he said: ‚Äòhaving got what you think is the
most satisfying result intellectually, you may then have
to ask yourself whether it is the commercially sensible,
practical, and morally sensible result.‚Äô Lord Neuberger‚Äôs
comment echoes Lord Reid in ‚ÄòThe Judge as Law
Maker‚Äô, when he suggested that the factors to be taken
into account were common sense, legal principle and
public policy‚Äîin that order.82

Lord Neuberger‚Äôs comments reinforce the notion
that the Starbucks (HK) court was cognizant of the
challenge posed by changing commercial circumstances,
but reached the conclusion that a change to the com-
mon law rule did not meet this standard. Starbucks
(HK) was and is the only passing off case to have been
considered by the Supreme Court to date.

Lord Neuberger went on to note that:

[E]ven 150 years ago, and maybe more recently, more
English laws were made by judges than by legislators. The
balance of the functions, a practical matter, may have
changed, but the nature of the functions, a matter of fun-
damental principle, has not.83

Nevertheless, Paterson‚Äôs study of decision-making in
the Supreme Court indicates that it is characterized by

reluctance to be creative with the common law and de-
part from precedents. He describes a ‚Äòretreat towards
formalism and a down-playing of the creative role of
the court‚Äô.84 The decision in Starbucks (HK) can be
seen as following this tendency, since the option of ex-
tending the common law was roundly declined in an
overwrought homage to formalism.

Formalism is not just about stickling for the rules,
but upholding the rule of law itself and inspiring conÔ¨Å-
dence in the common law as a positive source of law. It
is a necessary counterweight to judicial creativity when
it comes to balancing certainty with having a common
law which is sufÔ¨Åciently responsive to its dynamic com-
mercial and political environment. In this case, one can
argue, it seems to have outweighed the impetus for the
law to take a step forward with commercial changes.85

After all, the existence of a power to make dramatic in-
dependent changes to the law hardly behoves the person
wielding that power to use it. As Lord Reid observed:

Of course we must have a general doctrine of precedent‚Äî
otherwise we can have no certainty. But we must Ô¨Ånd a
middle way which prevents precedent from being our mas-
ter. That would be necessary even if the law were to remain
static: it is still more necessary if the law is to develop as
the needs of the time require.86

Still, disruptive change necessarily comes at the cost of
certainty, and but for the judicial interference the fore-
seeable outcome would have been the opposite. Studies
suggest that divergence from precedent can be person-
ally costly.87 The way Lord Neuberger put it was, ‚Äò[o]ne
judicial tactic to head off criticism is to hide behind the
law‚Äô.88 If your hands are tied by a binding precedent,
you need not stick their head above the parapet.

Passing off is an archetypal common law action that
feels akin to statute. A passage from Lord Oliver‚Äôs judg-
ment Reckitt & Colman is treated as the deÔ¨Ånitive for-
mula of the action, yet problems with interpretation
and deÔ¨Ånition persist. The need for clariÔ¨Åcation of
qualifying goodwill
in current commercial circum-
stances has been roundly demonstrated by the Starbucks

80 The problem of whether the ‚Äòright‚Äô case comes along is not limited to the
development of passing-off law. Discussing judicial developments under
the Lanham Act in the United States, Lunney argues that ‚Äòwrong‚Äô cases
are often brought before the court, resulting in distortions in trade mark
law. Glynn S. Lunney, Jr., ‚ÄòTrademark‚Äôs De-Evolution: Why Courts Get
Trademark Cases Wrong Repeatedly‚Äô, 106 Calif. L. Rev. [] (forthcoming
2018).

81 Lord Neuberger, ‚Äò‚ÄúJudge not, that ye be judged‚Äù: judging judicial decision

making‚Äô, F.A. Mann Lecture, 2015. Whether the talk was on his mind
when preparing the Starbucks (HK) judgment (or indeed vice versa) is a
matter of pure speculation.

It is noteworthy to consider the following characterization, albeit in the
US context, offered by a commentator in connection with a judgment

(HK) case. Jurisprudentially, without the systematic
beneÔ¨Åts of precedent in reducing litigation and promot-
ing certainty, the existence of decisions by an earlier
court would add no substantive reason to decide a case
a certain way, and the later decision would be no better
for it.

Foreign precedent
As noted, Lord Neuberger turns to precedent from
other jurisdictions, both in the name of consistency in
the common law and as a means to beneÔ¨Åt from their
learning, but without any real explanation why either of
these two considerations should ultimately matter. The
international subject matter in Starbucks (HK)‚Äîcom-
bining internet and television‚ÄîreÔ¨Çects the utility of
foreign precedent; the question of recognition of for-
eign goodwill is ripe for review from an international
perspective and has extra-jurisdictional implications. It
is natural to refer to comparative law as part of the
decision-making process in relation to international is-
sues. There is also more than a modest impetus to
match international trends rather than create inconsis-
tencies or gaps in legal protection between jurisdictions,
as well as signiÔ¨Åcant value to certainty in common law
internationally, since it by proxy promotes commercial
investment.89

Domestic precedents are legally binding, and foreign
precedents are not. Still, there is scope to take foreign
decisions into account as relevant considerations, albeit
at most on an instructive basis. It may be pragmatic to
learn,
from the experience of other legal systems,
whether they have dealt with comparable issues, which
is true to the extent that the other legal systems are
viewed as legitimately persuasive by English courts.

The Montesquian notion that the laws of one nation
would rarely, if ever, be suitable for another90 has aged
very badly and been superseded by an age of quasi-
international law-making, on the one hand, and cross-
fertilization of common law, on the other. Seen in this
way, the attention paid by the Supreme Court for for-
eign judgments is better appreciated, even if the manner

89

Indeed, one of the authors was present at a conference at which the for-
mer Chief Judge of the United States Federal Court of Appeal for the
Federal Circuit stated that he had been in contact with counterpart
judges in other countries regarding a certain case. The goal, it seemed,
was to the extent possible to reach a uniform result so that patent law
would be better able to serve as an international commercial lubricant
rather than as a series of diverse national barriers. See also, ‚ÄòCan Patent
Judges ‚ÄúColloquy‚Äù Themselves to Greater Uniformity?‚Äô IPKat, 30 August
2013, http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.il/2013/08/can-patent-judges-colloquy-
themselves.html (last accessed 2 May 2017); and F. Coelho, ‚ÄòLegal

by which these judgments were ultimately utilized, es-
pecially the ConAgra decision, can be questioned.

In particular, by the time of the Starbucks (HK) deci-
sion, the ConAgra decision was over 12 years old and
had been followed in South Africa, Singapore and con-
sistently in Australia. As Lord Neuberger noted, while it
was approved in theory that international reputation
could be a protectable form of goodwill, this had not
actually swung it for any of the cases cited, since they
also had failed to establish sufÔ¨Åcient reputation.

The pertinence of this for PCCM is that, at Ô¨Årst in-
stance, Arnold J had already accepted that if there were
a protectable goodwill in reputation, a substantial num-
ber of UK viewers would misapprehend that Sky‚Äôs now
emanated from the same or a connected source.91 This
was contested by Sky but not deeply reconsidered by ei-
ther the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. It is
not at all clear that Lord Neuberger was satisÔ¨Åed with
the evidence of PCCM‚Äôs UK reputation, since recogniz-
ing reputation outside the jurisdiction was dismissed in
principle.

Having considered a selection of cases, many treating
reputation or preparatory advertising as sufÔ¨Åcient bases
for establishing goodwill‚Äîat least in principle‚ÄîLord
Neuberger concluded, as noted, that there is no ‚Äòclear
trend‚Äô away from the current position.92 The inference
possibly being that if there were, that itself could be a
persuasive reason to follow suit. While there is no for-
mal obligation to ‚Äòresort‚Äô to foreign law, there may be
softer forces which may lead to a judge feeling com-
pelled to do so, whether to address points raised in ar-
gument, to demonstrate thorough analysis, or because
it may be somewhat remiss not to take foreign law into
account.93

There is intrinsic rationality in relying on past argu-
ments and decisions which deal with present issues, in-
sofar as they apply to the case at hand. As such, the
same can be contended in favour of using foreign prec-
edent; the difference is that they are not meaningfully
binding. To borrow the phrase from HHJ Hacon dis-
cussing Scandecor, it is about following ‚Äòthe direction of
travel‚Äô94 of

changing commercial circumstances. What was re-
quired to show such a trend, that is, ConAgra and its
progeny, with respect to the test for proving goodwill,
ultimately remains uncertain.

In sum, the Supreme Court was not persuaded that
the law was ripe for a change. A slightly different set of
facts may have led to them taking the path of protecting
goodwill based on pre-launch advertising and ‚Äòpriming
the market‚Äô as its direction of travel. It is conceivable to

imagine the balance tipping with regard to goodwill
outside the jurisdiction, notwithstanding that argu-
ments around the changing global market did not win
the court over this time. For the moment, however, the
Supreme Court has shored up certainty about the cur-
rent legal common law position and it will seemingly
take an even more powerful change in commercial
practice to sweep it away.
