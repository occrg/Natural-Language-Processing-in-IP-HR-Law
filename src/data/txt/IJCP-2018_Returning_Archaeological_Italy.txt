Returning Archaeological Objects to Italy
David W. J. Gill*

 

Abstract: It has been more than 20 years since the raids on the premises at the 
Geneva Freeport were linked to Giacomo Medici. The seizure of photographic 
records led to a major investigation of acquisitions by museums and private 
collectors. This was expanded following the confiscation of archives from Robin 
Symes and Gianfranco Becchina. Over 350 items have been returned to Italy 
from North American public and private collections as well as auction houses 
and galleries. This article reviews the returns and identifies some of the major 
themes. It also notes some of the unresolved cases both in North America and in 
Europe and Japan.

Keywords: Repatriation, photographic archives, forensic archaeology, art market, 
auction houses, antiquities market

The last two decades have seen a major shift in attitudes toward “looted” antiquities. 
Up to this point, concerns had been raised, but there was rarely substantial and 
compelling proof that would persuade a museum to hand over its valuable and 
valued  acquisitions.  In  1997,  Peter  Watson  exposed  the  scandal  surrounding 
the selling of recently surfaced antiquities through Sotheby’s in London based 
on  the  release  of  documentary  evidence  held  by  an  employee  of  the  auction 
house. This led to a decision by the auction house to stop selling “ancient art” 
through its London premises.1 In 1995, raids on the Geneva Freeport premises 
linked  to  Giacomo  Medici  brought  about  the  confiscation  of  large  numbers 
of  antiquities  as  well  as  a  photographic  archive  of  material  handled  by  this

individual and his associates.2 This seizure led directly to the return of material 
from North American collections.3

This study primarily provides an overview of the objects that have been returned 
to Italy from North American public museums, private collectors, and dealers. 
Second, it highlights some of the material that continues to be a matter of concern 
and  that  has  been  mentioned  in  earlier  discussions.  Third,  it  discusses  some  of 
the information that has started to emerge from the returns about the routes by 
which objects moved from Italy to North America. Fourth, it considers some of the 
broader categories of material.

PUBLIC COLLECTIONS

North American museums have long been seen as acquirers of material derived from 
archaeological  sites  in  Italy.  In  1972,  New  York’s  Metropolitan  Museum  of  Art 
(MMA), under the directorship of Thomas Hoving, acquired the Attic red-figured 
calyx-krater that showed the death of Sarpedon before Troy (the “Euphronios 
krater”).4 This was hailed as a major acquisition but soon attracted considerable 
attention. Philippe de Montebello, the director of the MMA had been a major critic 
of attempts by Italy and other countries to regain cultural property.5 In 1993, the 
museum agreed to return the so-called Lydian hoard of silver plate to Turkey that 
had been acquired over a number of years in the late 1960s.6 In February 2006, the 
museum announced that it would be returning the Sarpedon krater as well as the 15 
pieces of silver plate associated with the archaeological site of Morgantina in Sicily, an 
Attic amphora, and an Apulian dinos. In 2017 a Paestan krater attributed to Python 
was handed back after it had been identified from images in the Medici dossier.7

In September 2006, Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts announced that it had come 
to an agreement with Italy.8 A year earlier, it had rejected the concerns of Italy, but 
it quickly announced that it would be returning 13 items ranging from a major 
portrait of Sabina, the consort of Hadrian, to Attic and southern Italian pottery. 
Full  histories  were  provided  for  each  of  the  returned  objects  and  placed  on  the 
museum’s website.

The J. Paul Getty Museum has made several returns to Italy. In 1999, it handed 
back the Euphronios/Onesimos cup and, in 2005, the Asteas krater, made in Paestum, 
as well as an Etruscan candelabrum and a Greek inscription.9 In 2001, the museum 
returned approximately 3,500 fragments of Corinthian and Italo-Corinthian pottery

that appear to have been derived from a site at Francavilla Marittima. More recently, 
the museum made a major announcement timed to coincide with Thanksgiving 
Day 2006.10 A second statement covering additional material was issued in August 
2007.  The  overall  returns  include  the  Morgantina  statue  of  “Aphrodite,”  painted 
marble sculptures from southern Italy, wall painting fragments from Campania, as 
well as Attic and southern Italian pottery.11 Although the press release only listed the 
objects that were due to be returned, the museum staff helpfully supplied further 
details that made it possible to reconstruct part of the histories. One of the other 
wall-painting fragments, formerly part of the Lawrence and Barbara Fleischman 
collection, was returned in 2009. Marble fragments acquired from Robin Symes 
in 1988 was returned in the spring of 2012. A further piece—a terracotta head of 
Hades—was handed over in 2013. The head’s full collecting history appeared to have 
come to light as the museum prepared for a major loan exhibition on “Sicily.”12 In 
2017, a seated marble Zeus, formerly part of the Fleischman collection, was handed 
over to the Italian authorities after a fragment was identified from near Naples. 
Many of the returned objects were acquired by Marion True, a curator who was 
simultaneously trying to make the Getty’s acquisition process more rigorous.13

In  2007,  two  acrolithic  sculptures  on  loan  to  the  University  of  Virginia  Art 
Museum  in  Charlottesville  (Virginia)  were  returned  to  Sicily.  They  were  clearly 
related to the “Aphrodite” returned from the Getty. These acrolithic statues appear 
to have been looted from Morgantina around 1979 and were then handled by Robin 
Symes who sold them, in 1980, to Maurice Tempelsman for some US $1 million.

The  Princeton  University  Art  Museum  came  to  an  agreement  with  Italy  in 
October 2007. Some material would be returned to Italy, but seven items retained 
in Princeton were legally transferred to Italy. The returned items included an Attic 
red-figured psykter that was featured in the Memoirs of Robert Hecht. Subsequent 
to  this  announcement,  in  December  2011,  Princeton  agreed  to  return  a  further 
batch of material to Italy, including large numbers of Etruscan terracotta archi-
tectural fragments that had been acquired over several years.14 Some of the second 
group of objects were linked to the dealer Edoardo Almagià. They included the 
157 Etruscan architectural fragments that had been presented to the museum in 
1996. Part of the same series, a fragment given to the museum by the Aboutaam 
brothers of Switzerland, had been returned in the first batch of returns. The Ny 
Carlsberg in Copenhagen has returned some 500 antiquities to Italy, including a 
large number of fragmentary Etruscan architectural terracottas.15

The Cleveland Museum of Art agreed to return 14 objects in November 2008. 
The items included Apulian pottery and silver Etruscan jewelry. Few details were 
provided about the histories.16 However, it was possible to provide additional 
information,  such  as  for  the  two  Etruscan  bracelets  given  to  the  museum  by 
Almagià and Courtney Keep in honor of the former curator Arielle Kozloff. The 
majority of the Cleveland material included southern Italian pottery, several pieces 
of which were the gift of Jonathan P. Rosen. A further returned piece was a marble 
portrait head of Drusus Minor that was acquired in 2012.17 This had been acquired 
with the suggestion that it had come from an old Algerian collection, but research 
by Italian academics demonstrated that it had been excavated at Sessa Aurunca in 
Italy and placed in an archaeological store.

The Minneapolis Institute of Art was a reluctant participant in the negotiations. 
There was a single disputed Attic red-figured krater that was identified from both 
the Medici dossier and the Schinousa archive.18 The public account was that it 
had  formed  part  of  private  collections  in  England  and  Switzerland.  The  iden-
tification  had  been  made  public  in  November  2005,  but  the  institute  had  not 
opened  negotiations  with  the  Italian  authorities.  However,  after  the  director, 
Kaywin Feldman, issued a carelessly worded public statement in defense of the 
acquisition of an Egyptian mummy mask by the St Louis Art Museum, pressure 
was applied to the institute to return the krater.19 This took place in 2012.

One of the earliest reports of potentially looted material in North American 
museums  had  included  the  mention  of  an  Etruscan  hydria  attributed  to  the 
Michali painter in the Toledo Museum of Art. The museum agreed to return this 
in 2012, and it was handed over to Italian authorities in January 2013. The hydria 
had  been  acquired  from  Becchina  in  1982.  One  less  well-publicized  transfer  of 
ownership related to a Villanovan impasto hut acquired by the Fordham Univer-
sity Art Museum.20 This collection had been formed by William D. and Jane Walsh 
from the mid 1970s and had been given by them to Fordham in 2006. Few of the 
pieces had histories that could be traced back to the period before 1970. The collec-
tion also includes Roman imperial bronzes that appear to belong to the Sebasteion 
at Bubon in Turkey.

The  highly  publicized  scandal  relating  to  the  Almagià  material  returned  by 
Princeton to Italy prompted the director of the Dallas Museum of Art, Maxwell 
Anderson, to identify material that came from the same source in his collection.21 
This formed part of a voluntary return to Italy; in addition, a Roman mosaic was 

16I use the term “histories” to refer to the way that an object moves from collection to collection after 
it has been removed from the ground. I choose not to use the term “provenance,” which I consider to 
be misleading in terms of archaeological material.

handed  over  to  Turkey.  Anderson  has  had  a  well-established  and  nuanced  
approach to the issue of recently surfaced antiquities. At Emory University, he had 
established the Emory University Museum International Loan Project scheme that 
had encouraged the loans of major archaeological material from Italy such as one 
exhibition on Roman funerary portraits, another on archaeological material from 
Syracuse, and a third on Roman colored marbles.22 The unprompted investigation 
by Dallas appears to have allowed the objects to remain in the museum as loans 
from the Republic of Italy.

PUBLIC COLLECTIONS: UNRESOLVED CASES

Although  significant  returns  have  been  made  from  public  museums,  additional 
archaeological material in other collections has been identified from the Polaroid 
images. While some of these acquisition habits can be traced back to the period 
before the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970 UNESCO 
Convention), some of the more recently surfaced and disputed pieces are in North 
American  collections.23  For  example,  the  marble  statue  of  a  boy  acquired  by  
Virginia  in  1989  from  Galerie  Nefer  appears  to  have  featured  in  a  transaction 
between  Mario  Bruno  and  Becchina  in  1987.24  The  same  museum  also  has  a 
Gnathian askos that it acquired in 1980 from Fritz Bürki.25 Toledo has an Attic 
red-figured skyphos attributed to the Kleophon painter that has been identified in 
the Medici dossier.26

There  continue  to  be  unresolved  disputes  with  museums  outside  North 
America. The Miho Museum in Japan has often been cited in media reports and 
reportedly contains some 50 disputed objects.27 One of the objects that has been 
cited is a Roman marble oscillum.28 European museums have been notably absent 
from  the  instances  of  significant  returns.  The  Italians  took  legal  action  against 
Leiden’s Rijksmuseum van Oudheden for the return of a cuirass from Greek cav-
alry armor, acquired in 1998, but the Dutch courts rejected the claim in 2004. Some 
15 objects acquired by the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam had been han-
dled by dealers and auction houses such as Elie Borowski, Palladion Antike Kunst, 
Robin  Symes,  and  Sotheby’s  in  London.  The  Museo  Archaeológico  Nacional  in

Madrid  acquired  the  collection  of  Greek  pottery  formed  by  Várez  Pisa.29  Some 
22 pieces from this collection are reported to be featured in the seized dossiers of 
photographs from Medici, Becchina, and Symes. All of these examples suggest that 
the issue of acquiring recently surfaced archaeological material derived from Italy 
has not been confined to museums in North America but that it has been a global 
phenomenon.

PRIVATE COLLECTORS

In 2000, classical material in private collections that had been placed in a series 
of public exhibitions in North America and Europe formed the basis of a major 
study.30 One of the striking things to emerge from this piece of research was that 
a high percentage of the objects had no stated histories that could be traced back 
to the period before 1973 (the date of the adoption by the Archaeological Institute 
of America of their statement relating to illicit antiquities) and the 1970 UNESCO 
Convention. Two of the collections had been formed by Shelby White and Leon 
Levy and displayed at New York’s MMA as “Glories of the Past” and by Barbara 
and Laurence Fleischman in an exhibition displayed in the Getty and at Cleveland 
as “A Passion for Antiquities.”31 The collection of George Ortiz had been displayed 
in the Royal Academy of the Arts in London as “In Pursuit of the Absolute.”32

These collections were formed, no doubt, by a genuine interest in the past. The 
exhibition titles indicate the way that these objects were viewed: “In Pursuit of the 
Absolute” suggests the hunter, the chase, and the capture; “A Passion for Antiq-
uities” again evokes the idea of the search; and “Glories of the Past” suggests that 
these  objects  were  the  pinnacles  of  ancient  art  that  have  been  received  into  this 
newly formed collection. The thinking behind this last title evokes the exhibition 
of the Hunt brothers, “Wealth of the Ancient World,” suggesting that the objects 
within the show were somehow valued and valuable in antiquity.33 Such a position 
is clearly in tension with the ancient values.34

One  of  the  issues  that  has  been  overlooked  by  these  collectors  is  that  the 
real  “treasures”  and  valuable  objects  have  rarely  survived  from  antiquity.  
Chryselephantine statues on the scale of Pheidias’ mid-fifth century bc Olympian 
Zeus or Athena Parthenos have not survived the destruction of pagan temples in 
Late Antiquity. An exception would be the Roman ivory mask that was returned

to  Italy  after  being seized in London.35 Gold plate that features so prominently 
in  temple  inventories  and  classical  texts  rarely  survives,  though  exceptions  may 
include the Panagyurishte treasure from Thrace or the gold phiale returned to Italy 
from the collection of Michael Steinhardt.36 The same is also true for silver plate, 
though some stunning examples have survived such as the gold-figured silver plate 
from the burials at Duvanli, the royal burials at Vergina, or the Berthouville trea-
sure from northern France. Such material is largely absent from these private col-
lections of “Wealth” and “Glories.” Instead, there is an emphasis on objects such 
as  figure-decorated  pottery  made  in  Athens  and  southern  Italy.  It  is  clear  from 
ancient commercial trademarks scratched on the base of Athenian pottery that this 
category of ancient “art” was relatively cheap.37 For example, an Attic red-figured 
pelike may be priced in obols, whereas a silver phiale could be worth 1 mina (the 
equivalent of 100 drachmas or 600 obols) in bullion value alone. Yet Athenian and 
southern Italian pottery has been privileged by the attribution of the pots to largely 
anonymous  artists  creating  workshops,  groups,  and  spheres  of  influence.  The 
implications of this research into ancient values and the tension with the commer-
cial value placed on modern collections of antiquities have been realized by those 
involved in the market.38

Research on these private collections has suggested that many of the objects did 
not have established and extensive histories. Simon Mackenzie, a criminologist, has 
been critical of this approach, suggesting that it would be inappropriate to suspect 
objects of being “looted” just on the grounds of an absence of a full collecting  
history.39 However, the emergence of the Medici dossier has identified objects from 
two of these private collections: Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman and Leon Levy and 
Shelby White. A substantial number of the returns from the Getty included objects 
that had either been purchased or been received as a gift from the Fleischmans. Two 
of the items were fragments of a Roman wall painting that seemed to come from 
the same composition as a fragment in the Shelby White and Leon Levy collection. 
One wonders how these fragments were separated as they passed through the market 
and  ended  up  in  separate  collections.  The  Fleischman  returns  included  Attic  and 
southern  Italian  pottery.  Additionally,  the  couple  had  also  donated  a  Campanian 
bird askos to the Cleveland that has separately been returned to Italy.40

The Fleischman material was returned to Italy once it had been acquired by the 
Getty. However, Shelby White still retained the objects that had been formed with 
her husband. In January 2008, she finally came to an agreement with the Italian 
authorities to return 10 items, although the Kyknos krater attributed to Euphronios

was not returned until 2010.41 Two further objects were handed over to Greece in 
July 2008, and a disputed statue of the weary Herakles, which had also once formed 
part of their collection, was returned to Turkey from Boston.42 Several, though not 
all, of the items had appeared in “Glories of the Past” exhibit.43

These  two  prominent  New  York  couples,  with  strong  links  to  major  North 
American public museums, feature prominently in the returns, but they are not 
the only North American collectors who owned material that has been returned 
to Italy. The Hunt Brothers had endeavored to corner the world silver market, but 
when their efforts were curtailed, they were encouraged to turn their attention to 
antiquities  under  the  guiding  curatorial  hand  of  some  individuals  who  perhaps 
hoped the collection would one day be passed to their museums.44 Due to financial 
difficulties, the collection was dispersed and passed into other private collections. 
The Kyknos krater attributed to Euphronios passed into the Leon Levy and Shelby 
White  collection,  and  the  Etruscan  antefix  representing  a  satyr  and  a  maenad 
entered the Fleischman collection, appearing on the cover of the catalogue of their 
collection; it subsequently formed part of the Getty’s collection. The Athenian red-
figured cup attributed to Euphronios had a complex history passing through the 
hands of Giacomo Medici and returning to Italy.45

The Getty material also included a group of objects that had been derived from 
the jeweler Maurice Tempelsman.46 The stunning painted marble griffins killing 
a doe had formed part of his collection; a picture from the Medici dossier shows 
Medici posing in front of the group in the Getty. Other items from Tempelsman 
include  a  marble  Apollo.  He  also  owned  the  two  acrolithic  statues  that  were 
returned from Virginia to Sicily.

Another  group  of  antiquities  formed  part  of  the  Kluge  collection,  owned  by 
financier John Kluge and Patricia Kluge.47 Returned material include bronze 
figures of an athlete and a Nike, both stolen from museums in Italy, an Attic black-
figured krater attributed to the Bucci painter, an Attic lekythos attributed to the 
group of Palermo 16, and a Paestan lekythos acquired from a Swiss private collec-
tion. In addition, nine former pieces from the Kluge collection are reported to be 
in Madrid and form part of the Italian investigation.

Dietrich von Bothmer had curated the Greek and Roman collection at the MMA 
for several decades until he was succeeded by Carlos Picon in 1990. He was well 
known as a collector of pottery fragments, and some of these had been featured in 
the returns from the Getty, notably the red-figured krater attributed to the Berlin 
painter and the Onesimos cup. It is reported that Bothmer donated over 100 such

fragments to the Getty, although their histories remain unclear. In January 2012, a 
carefully worded notice that omitted to name the owner announced that 40 frag-
ments had been returned to Italy.48 It appeared that some of them fitted pots that 
had already been returned to Italy such as the Onesimos cup returned from the 
Getty. The Italian press subsequently revealed that they had belonged to Bothmer. 
The MMA eventually published a token number of images on the Association of 
Art Museum Directors’s (AAMD) Object Registry, and one image showed the frag-
ments for an Attic red-figured cup that was in the Villa Giulia in Rome.49 These 
specific fragments have now been returned.

Another  collector  of  pottery  fragments  was  Robert  Guy,  one-time  curator  at 
Princeton. He donated fragments for the Attic amphora attributed to the Berlin 
painter  that  was  acquired  by  the  MMA  and  returned  to  Italy  alongside  the 
Sarpedon krater. Yet the photographs from the Medici dossier indicate that the 
amphora passed through Medici. It remains unclear how fragments of it came into 
Guy’s possession. Guy himself was the source of the large group of pottery frag-
ments that were purchased by Harvard University Art Museum.50 This collection 
of potsherds was defended by James Cuno, a former director at Harvard, who con-
sidered them to be insignificant.51 Yet it is now clear from both raids in Rome and 
a study of the returned finds that near complete pots could be broken up as they 
passed through the market, and the pot restored by the final destination museum.
Among  the  private  collectors  represented  in  the  returns  was  Jonathan  Rosen. 
Five of the Cleveland objects had been donated by him. He had also contributed to 
the purchase of the Attic red-figured psykter that had been acquired by Princeton. 
He was also closely associated with the loan exhibition of Italian material in private 
collections that was displayed in Switzerland.52 Rosen himself has been associated 
with the 10,000 cuneiform tablets returned from Cornell University in 2013.53

Some  of  the  private  collectors  are  little  known.  For  example,  among  the  returns 
was a Roman marble head from the collection of Mr and Mrs Charles W. Newhall III. 
This had been purchased through the Montreal market. The head was identified 
from the Becchina photographic archive. Other private individuals listed as former 
owners from among the Getty material may have formed part of the complex 
acquisition plans of dealers outlined by Bruce McNall, owner of Summa Galleries. 
In his autobiography, he explains how he worked with Jiri Frel to acquire objects 
that  the  Getty’s  board  would  otherwise  be  unwilling  to  acquire.54  It  seems  that 
potential objects for purchase were identified, and private individuals would then 
be invited to acquire and donate them with tax benefits.

CORPORATE OWNERS

Some  individuals  may  have  acquired  objects  as  an  investment  that  could  be  
realized in their future sale. This is reflected in the formation of the Athena Funds 
where objects were laid down and then sold at a major sale. Thus, for example, the 
Roman silver “Swiss army penknife” (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, University 
of Cambridge) was sold through this fund even though its only previous history 
was its viewing in a Soho safe.55

Classical  sculptures  are  seen  as  appropriate  backdrops  for  private  houses  and 
living spaces, but they have also been used by corporations. In 2011, two Roman 
statues—one  representing  Fortuna—were  returned  from  Humana,  a  healthcare 
company.56 One had been acquired from the Merrin Gallery in New York in 1984. 
The Fortuna had been stolen in Rome in October 1986.

DEALERS AND GALLERIES

The last 20 years have been dominated by a series of high-profile seizures from 
dealers in Switzerland. The journalistic investigation into the operation of the 
antiquities  department  at  Sotheby’s  in  London  has  established  the  supply  of 
classical  objects  from  Italy  via  middlemen  in  Switzerland.57  Sotheby’s  subse-
quently took the decision to cease selling antiquities in London and transferred 
the activity to New York. It has also encouraged a more rigorous due diligence 
search for antiquities appearing in their sales that has led to a significant decrease 
in toxic lots.

When  archaeological  items  stolen  from  the  home  of  Marchesa  Alessandra  de 
Marchi  in the Torre Paola at San Felice Circeo in April 1986 surfaced at Sotheby’s 
in London in May 1987, Italian investigators pursued the leads.58 It was revealed that 
Editions Services S.A had consigned the items. The prosecutor in Latina sent a for-
mal request for further information to their colleagues in Switzerland in April 1995, 
and this allowed Giacomo Medici to be identified as the owner of the company. The 
investigation led the Italian authorities to Medici’s warehouse facilities in the Geneva 
Freeport. The raid in September 1995 revealed a significant number of objects 
(approximately 3,800) as well as a major dossier of Polaroid photographs docu-
menting the pieces that had been handled by the dealer. It is this dossier that helped 
to make positive identifications with objects in various international collections.59

Yet Medici was not the only dealer operating out of Switzerland. Raids in Basel 
recovered  a  significant  number  of  objects  from  the  premises  associated  with

Gianfranco Becchina. Alongside them were photographs and other documentary 
evidence  that  has  helped  to  identify  other  material.  The  objects  associated  with 
Italy—some 4,400 items—were returned in three trucks in November 2008. These 
items were finally displayed to the public in a major press event at the Terme di 
Diocleziano del Museo Nazionale Romano in January 2015. This attracted major 
public attention not least because the haul was valued at over €50 million.

In  2009,  Operation  Phoenix  returned  251  antiquities  worth  around  €2.7  million 
from  Phoenix  Ancient  Art  based  in  Geneva.  Many  objects  seem  to  have  been 
derived from Etruria and southern Italy. The raid on this gallery was significant 
as this business has also handled such high-profile objects as the Ka-Nefer-Nefer 
Egyptian mummy mask acquired by the St Louis Art Museum and the Leutwitz 
bronze Apollo acquired by Cleveland.60

In  June  2010,  Operation  Andromeda  contributed  to  the  return  of  some  337 
antiquities worth €15 million to Italy. They had formed part of the stock of the 
Japanese dealer Noryioshi Horiuchi, who was based in Switzerland. Horiuchi was 
associated with the supply of objects to the newly established Miho Museum in 
Japan and was known to have business connections with Becchina.

Not all of the raids have taken place in Switzerland. The British authorities seized 
some 27,000 objects worth US $250 million from 29 warehouses across London.61 
These were associated with the London-based dealer Robin Symes.62 In addition, 
raids on Symes’s villa on the Greek island of Schinoussa allowed the authorities to 
gain access to a third major archive of photographs and documents. The Italian 
authorities have requested the return of the seized objects from the government of 
the United Kingdom, but there has been no satisfactory resolution to date.

These major, high-profile raids have provided a snapshot of the workings of the 
networks of antiquity dealers. The seizure of documentary evidence and photo-
graphs of items that have passed through these same dealers in previous years has 
allowed further identifications to be made. In November 2007, the Royal-Athena 
Galleries (RAG) in New York agreed to hand over eight items. Three of the pieces 
had been stolen from Italian collections between 1970 and 1975, and two of them had 
resided in the Morven (i.e., Kluge) collection. In spite of this claim, RAG contin-
ued to handle material that could be identified from the photographic archives. In 
2010, Christos Tsirogiannis was able to identify 15 items on sale by RAG that could 
be identified from the Medici, Becchina, and related photographic archives. RAG 
has also been associated with the inadvertent handling of material stolen from the 
archaeological museum in Corinth in 1998. It should be noted that, in June 2012, 
Dr Jerome Eisenberg, the proprietor of RAG, was awarded the Order of the Star of 
Italy by the Italian authorities for his cooperation with the investigations into the 
illicit market.

Other  Manhattan  galleries  have  been  linked  to  returned  material.  In  2011,  a 
bronze Zeus was returned to Italy. It was recognized that this figure had been sto-
len  from  Muzeo  Nazionale  Romano  in  1980.  The  statue  had  surfaced  in  North 
American exhibitions in 1982 and 1983 with the (clearly false) claim that it had 
formed part of a Swiss private collection in the 1960s. In 1984, the statue was iden-
tified as the property of Edward H. Merrin of New York (hence, the Merrin Zeus). 
By 1988, it formed part of the Fleischman collection and appeared in the exhibition 
“The Gods Delight: The Human Figure in Classical Bronze.”63 It was subsequently 
sold at Sotheby’s New York in December 2004. The Zeus was returned to Italy with 
a marble female torso that had been stolen from the museum in Terracina in 1988. 
It had been spotted in a New York gallery by a member of the Italian Carabinieri 
who had been on holiday in New York.

A  Roman  wall  painting  from  Boscoreale  was  seized  from  an  unspecified  Man-
hattan gallery in 2009.64 It had been stolen from the archaeological store at Pompeii 
around 1997. Five other fragments stolen from the same store at the same time had 
previously been returned to Italy. Another unnamed Manhattan gallery returned six 
antiquities to Italy in April 2017.

Several pieces have been returned from Christie’s in New York. One of the most 
important  seizures  was  associated  with  the  June  2009  sale.  Prior  to  the  sale,  a 
Corinthian krater was seized. This had first surfaced in an auction at Sotheby’s in 
1985. After the sale had taken place, two further items were seized and subsequently 
returned: an Attic pelike attributed to the Aegisthus painter and an Apulian situla. 
Both  of  these  pieces  had  passed  through  Bruce  McNall’s  Summa  Galleries  in  Los 
Angeles,  surfacing  in  1977  and  in  the  mid-1980s.  Christie’s  again  do  not  seem  to 
have strengthened its due diligence process, and material identified from the seized 
photographic  archives  has  continued  to  appear  in  its  auctions.65  Interestingly  
Christie’s has tended to reject the identifications and press ahead with the sale of 
the lots, although this has sometimes meant that their value has been diminished 
or that lots have been left unsold. Three pieces were identified in the June 2010 sale, 
including a youth with a cockerel, the property of a Massachusetts private collector, 
which had surfaced at a Christie’s auction in London in 1997, although the cata-
logues failed to note that it had originally surfaced at Sotheby’s in London in July 
1992. The Apulian rhyton had surfaced through Sotheby’s in New York in June 1994. 
A Canosan terracotta had surfaced in London in July 1984 and had passed into an 
English private collection. Concerns were raised in the press, but Christie’s contin-
ued with the sale. Paolo Ferri commented on the action, suggesting that Christie’s 
was acting unethically.66 Two of the pieces were sold, and one was unsold.

More  recently,  a  Sardinian  figure,  owned  by  Michael  Steinhardt,  was  offered 
at  auction  at  Christie’s.  An  outcry  by  politicians  in  Sardinia  led  to  diplomatic 
approaches  to  the  US  authorities.  The  figure  was  withdrawn  from  the  auction. 
Steinhardt is not without interest as he is also a member of the American Advi-
sory Board of Christie’s. Bruce McNall has been discussed as the person behind 
some of the returned material such as the collection formed by the Hunt Brothers 
or  the  items  acquired  by  the  Getty.  Another  dealer  who  has  been  linked  to  the 
returns is Edoardo Almagià. His name was associated with Etruscan silver bracelets 
that were returned from Cleveland; the items had been given by Courtney Keep in 
honor of the museum’s curator Arielle Kozloff. Revelations in the June 2010 New 
York  Times  led  to  a  further  investigation  into  material  acquired  by  Princeton.67 
In  December  2011,  the  museum  claimed  that  six  items  had  been  transferred  to 
the Italians. They included an Attic red-figured calyx-krater that had been attrib-
uted  to  Euphronios.  However,  one  of  the  “items”  consisted  of  157  terracotta 
architectural fragments from an Etruscan temple, and a further item consisted of 
five architectural fragments. Interestingly, these Etruscan objects were linked to an 
architectural fragment already returned by Princeton that had been provided by 
the Aboutaam brothers. The revelation meant that Maxwell Anderson conducted 
an urgent review of any material in Dallas that had been acquired from Almagià, 
and after a posting on the AAMD’s Object Registry, they were returned to Italy.68 
Other museums have also been identified as acquiring objects from Almagià, and 
it is unclear the state of their internal enquiries into the objects.

The seizures have not all taken place in New York. In October 2010, a statue 
of  Zeus  stolen  from  the  Norwegian  Institute  in  Rome  was  returned  from  an 
unspecified London dealer. A Roman marble sarcophagus stolen from the Chiesa 
della Modonna della Libera di Aquino in 1991 was recovered in London as part of 
Operation Giovenale. In 2008, the sale of the antiquities collection formed by the 
Australian dealer Graham Geddes at Bonham’s in London was disrupted when 
the Italian authorities asked for a number of lots to be withdrawn, including the 
Athenian krater that had featured on the front of the auction house’s magazine 
that was advertising the sale.69 In the end, 10 lots were withdrawn from the sale, of 
which seven had surfaced at Sotheby’s in London between 1984 and 1989. Geddes’s 
name had already been associated with a Lucanian nestoris returned from Boston, 
and his name appeared against a Lucanian krater that was linked to Medici.

COMMON PATHWAYS

One of the common routes for this archaeological material to enter the market is 
through Switzerland. Objects have been identified from the Medici and Becchina

photographic archives suggesting that they formed the stock in Italy. Several pieces 
in Boston were sold by the restorer Fritz Bürki. They include the statue of Sabina. 
The Fleischman collection included a Pontic amphora and an Apulian bell-krater 
that had been handled by Bürki. At least one object in Madrid appears in a photo-
graph of a group of objects that appear to have been in Bürki’s bathroom studio. 
It  was  reported  that  some  of  the  Cleveland  material  was  derived  from  Bürki.  It 
appears that some 350 pieces handled by Bürki appear in a series of photographs 
that are in the possession of the Italian police.

Peter  Watson’s  investigation  into  the  paperwork  relating  to  the  department  of 
antiquities at Sotheby’s demonstrates a link between Medici, his Swiss agents, and 
Sotheby’s.70 Consignment lists to Sotheby’s contain material that can be identified. 
So far, at least seven objects that have been returned to Italy could be demonstrated 
to have passed through Sotheby’s in London. This “toxic” route also caused prob-
lems for the sale of the Geddes collection at Bonham’s in London when several pieces 
had to be withdrawn.

One  of  the  areas  that  has  not  yet  been  investigated  is  whether  or  not  Medici 
made consignments to Sotheby’s in New York. However, it is clear that a handful 
of pieces identified from the dossier did enter the market via that route, including 
an  Apulian  rhyton  that  surfaced  in  1994  and  a  Peucetian  clay  stamnos  in  1995. 
These examples raise the specter that there could be further disruptions to unsettle 
the market, museums, and collectors.

The  Attic  krater  returned  from  Minneapolis  had  been  recorded  as  forming 
part of a Swiss private collection.71 However, it appears in a Polaroid within the 
Medici dossier. It seems that the krater had been passed from Medici to Symes 
who  had  sold  the  piece  to  Minneapolis.  This  relationship  means  that  the  his-
tories  of  material  handled  by  Symes  need  to  be  investigated.72  His  connection 
with objects has caused disruption at a number of sales including Bonham’s in 
London and Christie’s in the Rockefeller Centre. Bonham’s has been linked to 
other items that have been withdrawn from sales or left unsold at auction. Apart 
from the Geddes sale, these items include a Roman marble statue of a youth that 
had surfaced through Sotheby’s in London but was identified from the Medici 
dossier.73

In terms of fragments, there is concern that complete pots may have been delib-
erately broken and their fragments passed to individual collectors or dealers who 
then  sold  or  donated  the  objects  so  that  they  could  be  reunited  in  the  target 
museum. An area that has not been explored is the attribution of Athenian and 
southern Italian pottery to named, largely anonymous, pot painters. It is unclear 
when scholars were shown the pots or fragments for attribution or if they were

unaware that they were commenting on recently surfaced material. It would be of 
some concern if any of them received payments in kind.

THEMES OF MATERIAL

What sort of archaeological material from Italy was being acquired by North 
American  museums  and  private  collectors?  Pottery  dominates  the  returns. 
Many of the items are complete pieces that are likely to have been removed from 
graves where they had been protected (with their funerary assemblages) for some 
2,500  years.  The  pottery  falls  into  two  main  groups:  Athenian  and  southern  
Italian.

The  Athenian  pottery  is  dominated  by  the  Sarpedon  krater  returned  by  the 
MMA. The association with Euphronios leads to further companion pieces.74 One 
is  the  Kyknos  krater  returned  by  Shelby  White,  and  another  is  the  fragmentary 
calyx-krater (consisting of four pieces) in Princeton. Linked to these pieces is the 
cup that had formed part of the Hunt collection and had passed into the holdings 
of Medici.

Three  pots  attributed  to  the  Berlin  painter  have  been  returned.  Among  them 
is a fragmentary krater that had been acquired by the Getty from 1977 to 1990.75 
Among  the  donors  or  vendors  of  the  fragments  were  Dietrich  von  Bothmer, 
Herbert Lucas, Vasek Polak, Frederick H. Schultz, Jr, and Robin Symes. A further 
set of 35 fragments were loaned in 1989 reportedly from Medici. An amphora 
attributed  to  the  same  painter  was  returned  from  New  York’s  MMA.76  Robert 
Guy supplied some 15 additional fragments. The amphora was identified from the 
Medici dossier when it was in “the early stages of restoration.” Finally, a hydria was 
returned from Boston.77 This had been acquired from Bürki.

Southern Italian pottery is well represented among the returns.78 Apulian pot-
tery forms a major component. One of the best represented painters is the Darius 
painter: a volute-krater from Cleveland, an amphora from Boston, a loutropho-
ros  from  Princeton,  a  pelike  from  the  Getty,  and  a  dinos  from  New  York.  A  pot 
attributed to the Darius painter was returned as part of Operation Andromeda. The 
Madrid  collection  also  contains  a  work  attributed  to  the  Darius  painter.  Works 
attributed to the Darius painter also feature prominently in a supposed tomb group 
acquired by Berlin.79

Etruscan material features regularly in the returns. The largest group con-
sists  of  a  series  of  architectural  fragments  from  a  temple  that  was  returned

by  Princeton.  Other  terracotta  architectural  fragments  include  the  satyr  and 
Maenad or the two separate groups of fragments from the Getty. Princeton’s 
return included an Etruscan tufa lion. Other returned pieces include Etruscan 
bronzes and sculptures.

Roman material is less visible in the returns. One of the reasons may be that 
it is harder to associate material culture with a specific modern nation-state as 
such items can be found across the lands formally occupied by the Roman Empire. 
Among these pieces of sculpture are the Roman portrait of Sabina, the marble 
Fortuna, and the series of sculptures returned from the Getty that may be associ-
ated with a villa complex in southern Italy. Three fragments of Roman wall painting 
from  the  same  composition  were  returned  from  the  Getty  (that  had  formerly 
formed part of the Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman collection) and the Shelby 
White and Leon Levy collection. Other wall-painting fragments were returned as 
part of Operation Andromeda.

MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND RECIPROCAL LOANS

One of the ways that the US and Italian authorities have worked together to try 
and reduce the amount of looting of archaeological sites in Italy has been through 
a  bilateral  agreement  first  made  in  2001,  amended  and  extended  in  2006  and 
2011, and amended and extended in 2016.80 This agreement has sought to identify 
cultural property that is specifically linked to Italy that would encourage a more 
thorough investigation when imported to the United States. Controversially, the 
agreement has been expanded to include certain categories of ancient coins.81 This 
has been opposed rigorously by lobbying groups representing numismatic dealers 
not just in North America but also in Europe who are concerned that part of their 
potential market could be restricted.

Part of the bilateral agreement encourages the Italian authorities to protect 
archaeological  sites  and  their  heritage.  The  level  of  looting  can  be  measured 
in part by the apparent decrease in seizures by the Carabinieri. Concerns have 
been raised about the deterioration of some complex archaeological sites such 
as  Pompeii  as  evidence  that  the  Italian  authorities  are  not  concerned  about 
their cultural heritage. However, all national governments have been facing fiscal 
pressures during the present economic crisis, and the preservation, protection, 
and  conservation  of  extensive  long-excavated  remains  that  are  open  to  the  ele-
ments is an issue that remains a long-term problem. It is also a reminder that 
the excavation of archaeological remains needs to include a long-term plan for

the display, interpretation, and protection of remains that are deemed worthy 
of public display.

The bilateral agreement has also made provision for the loan of archaeolog-
ical remains from the major holdings of museums in Italy. These loans have 
included the bronze chimaera in Florence that was placed on loan to the Getty 
and Attic pottery that was loaned to the MMA. In addition, the Italians have 
co-curated  a  major  loan  exhibition  on  Sicily  that  was  displayed  in  the  Getty 
and  in  Cleveland.82  University  and  civic  museums  such  as  Dallas,  Fordham, 
and Princeton have been allowed to retain some of the objects that they have 
acquired, although the legal title has been transferred to the Italian authorities. 
This  reflects  the  Italian  authorities’  willingness  to  avoid  unnecessary  disrup-
tion  to  public  displays  while  asserting  their  legal  rights  over  looted  cultural 
property.

CONCLUSION

The returns from North American museums, private collectors, and galleries have 
been highly damaging for the reputations of institutions, businesses, and private 
individuals (Table 1). Some of the reputational damage could have been avoided 
by the application of more developed ethical standards over acquisitions and the 
handling  of  recently  surfaced  material.  The  debate  about  returning  antiquities 
has focused somewhat on why North American museums should be forced to 
return material to Italy when its museums and archaeological stores are already 
full of material that cannot be placed on public display. Indeed, there has been a 
public suggestion by Anna Somers Cocks that the Italian authorities should sell 
off  part  of  their  rich  collections  to  create  an  income  to  protect  archaeological 
remains.83 One of the key issues is that looting of archaeological sites has mate-
rial consequences. Cemeteries are disturbed, grave groups are broken up, asso-
ciations are lost, and even general information about general find-spots are left 
unrecorded. The sum total is that very specific information is lost and can never 
be recovered, even by informed stylistic studies of the material. Thus, the uncon-
trolled acquisition of newly surfaced archaeological material by public museums 
and private collectors in North America (and elsewhere) was unsustainable for 
the archaeological record. The negative publicity for museums, private individ-
uals, and galleries has discouraged the trade and thereby decreased the demand 
for material with a linked decrease in looting.

Collectors may be seen to be exempt from these concerns. However, there are 
issues about what happens to the collection when collectors die or no longer wish 
to own it. Curators in North America will be reluctant to acquire recently surfaced

Notes: a This does not include the 3,500 Corinthian and Italo-Corinthian fragments returned to Italy in 2001.

material from collectors unless there is authenticated documentation demon-
strating that the objects have not been looted. After all, would a museum wish to 
acquire material from a private collection only to have to go through a damaging 
return process if the objects were identified from a known or some other pho-
tographic archive that will be revealed in the future? But, if the objects are sold 
through a gallery or auction house, the same concerns are there. It is clear from 
the sale of the Steinhardt Sardinian figure that once an object is identified from 
one of the photographic archives, an object has either to be withdrawn from sale 
or it runs the risk of being left unsold. An object that may have been acquired as 
an investment could end up as a worthless item—worthless in terms of monetary 
value and worthless in scientific value as it has been stripped of its archaeological 
information.

The spate of returns as a result of the recovery of the Becchina, Medici, and 
Schinoussa documentary and photographic archives have been the result not of 
complex  legal  cases  but,  rather,  of  negotiated  returns.  Museums  and  the  Italian  
authorities have been saved the complexity of legal cases that could have cost more 
than the value of the objects that the Italians were seeking to have returned. And 
museums have avoided having to release information about acquisition policies 
and decision-making that could have led to significant embarrassment for direc-
tors, trustees, and curatorial staff and implications when staff have moved to 
other institutions.

RETURNING ARCHAEOLOGICAL OBJECTS TO ITALY 

301

The returns have influenced institutional changes in North American museums.84 
The newly formulated guidelines for acquiring antiquities and ancient art that 
have  been  issued  by  the  AAMD  reflect  a  desire  to  move  in  the  direction  of  
responsible collecting. Indeed, the creation of the AAMD’s Object Registry shows 
a desire for museums to adopt a level of transparency. The system, of course, 
is not perfect. The unwillingness of the MMA to place online even a significant 
proportion  of  the  Bothmer  collection  of  pottery  sherds  could  be  interpreted 
as  protecting  the  collector’s  memory.85  Given  that  part  of  the  collection  has 
already been returned to Italy, there are genuine concerns that the potsherds 
include associations that have yet to be made, perhaps with fragmentary pots that 
have already been returned to Italy. But it takes time to photograph and digi-
tize the records, and so we look forward to this task to be completed to allow 
public scrutiny.

More disturbing is the provocative acquisition of apparently newly surfaced 
antiquities by major museums that could be seen as a challenge to the AAMD’s 
guidelines.  For  example,  Cleveland  acquired  the  portrait  statue  of  Drusus 
Minor that it claimed had been acquired from an old Algerian collection. The 
secure collecting history can only be traced back to 2004, whereas the oral his-
tory, unsupported by documented and authenticated paperwork, attempts to 
place it in the late nineteenth century.86 The return of the portrait to Italy in 
2017 is a reminder that the museum had been unwise to pursue the acquisition. 
In addition, the acquisition of the Leutwitz Apollo by the same museum (and 
from the same Swiss dealer) has raised concerns about the veracity of part of the 
collecting history.87 The alleged emergence of the fragmentary statue in a private 
house in eastern Germany has raised serious questions about the authenticity of 
the account.

This discussion has focused on material derived from Italy, but it is only the 
tip of the iceberg. Material such as a gold wreath, a marble kore,88 an inscription 
from  Thorikos,  and  a  funerary  stele  have  been  returned  from  the  Getty,  and 
Shelby White has returned the upper part of a funerary stele that fits the lower 
part excavated in a rural cemetery in southern Attica.89 Boston has returned the 
upper part of the Weary Herakles that fitted the lower part of the statue that 
had  been  excavated  in  Pamphylia  in  southern  Turkey.  Dallas  has  voluntarily 
returned a Late Roman mosaic to Turkey. Shelby White has agreed to return a 
set of Roman bronze statues from Icklingham, Suffolk, to the United Kingdom 
after her death.90

The returns have demonstrated the power of media, and, increasingly, social 
media, to influence public opinion and to encourage museum teams to return 
improperly  acquired  objects.91  It  is  unlikely  that  the  Italian  authorities  would 
have achieved the same result if they had approached each museum, collector, 
and gallery through a court case. The costs are also likely to have been prohibi-
tive. In the long term, what is needed is a more rigorous due diligence process put 
in place by the market and a more cautious and ethically responsible approach by 
museums and other acquirers of such archaeological material.
