Mash-Up Songs: Are There Any Exceptions to the
Exclusive Rights in the Light of the Jordanian
Copyright Protection and Related Rights Law?

This article focuses on the phenomenon of mash-up songs. The paper highlights the exclusive rights of authors and
audio recordings producers under the Jordanian Copyright Protection and Related Rights Law (No. 22 of 1992) and its
latest amendments in 2014. I will refer to UK, US, Australian and Canadian laws and case laws because there is no
judicial precedent in Jordan relating to mash-up songs, and Jordan as a developing country shall beneﬁt from the
experience of other jurisdictions, in this ﬁeld. One of the exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights, that is, fair use
defence was developed in England in the eighteenth century and the United States in the nineteenth century in Folsom
v Marsh case. Moreover, the Canadian Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42) has recently added a “mash-up
exception”, therefore, it would be interesting to refer in brief, to the above exception. I will distinguish between the
exclusive rights of authors and audio recordings producers that are applicable to mash-ups. My aim in this paper is to
determine whether there are any exceptions and limitations to these exclusive rights. This article concludes by
recommending the inclusion of mash-up exceptions to the Jordanian law.

Keywords Copyright; mash-ups; songs; exclusive rights

Introduction and Background
The ﬁrst Jordanian Copyright Protection Law was enacted in 1992, and it is based on “author's right”
system—“droit d'auteur” in French. The Law of 1992 cancelled the Ottoman Authors Rights Act of 19101
which was applicable in Jordan and other Arab countries under the Ottoman rule. The Jordanian Copyright
Protection Law has been amended several times,2 the latest amendments taking effect in 2014, which
revised the title of the Law to “Copyright Protection and Related Rights Law”.

Jordan joined WIPO in 1972, and is party to the Berne Convention, since 28 July 1999.3 Moreover,
Jordan became the 136th member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 April, 2000, a party to the
WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT),4 since 27 January 2004, and a party to the WIPO Performances and
Phonograms Treaty (WPPT),5 since 24 February 2004.

Defining the Mash-Up
Mash-up6 songs depend on two or more existing pieces of songs (Power, 2007, p. 579); they are often
created with computer software extracting the vocals from one song and the instrumentals track from
another, and combining them to create something recognizable and new at
the same time.
(Barbagallo, 2010).7 Mash-ups in general are not limited to audios; they could be videos created by
using different scenes from different ﬁlms; texts made by integrating, for example, a zombie story into the
text of a famous novel, or images produced by adding, for example, one's own text to someone else's
photograph (Australian Copyright Council, 2013, p. 1). Moreover, the term may also refer to “web mash-
ups” (Reyes, 2011, p. 476) which means “fusing data from two or more Web applications to create an
integrated experience informed by the original data sources” (Palfrey and Gasser, 2007, p. 2).8 However, I
will focus only on mash-up songs in this article, and the term “mash-up” will refer to “mash-up song”.
