Summary judgment in intellectual property
litigationâ€”the three of Harts
Jeremy Phillips*

1. Summarizing the summary
Litigation may be likened to a stream that flows
from the upper reaches of legal dispute, along the
course of the river of pre-trial management and pre-
paration, through the broad estuary of
litigation,
and out to the open sea of fair resolution. A good sys-
tem for conducting litigation will enable a dispute to
reach the courts and flow through them with little
blockage or hindrance, whereas a poor system will
produce floods, turbulence, and the risk of great
destruction.

Intellectual property is just one such stream; there
are many others, such as real estate, negligence,
defamation, company law. Each stream has its own
defining characteristics that mark it out clearly from
the others; indeed, specialist channels for litigation
exist in the form of, for example, the Patents Court
in intellectual property law and the Construction
and Technology Court for a variety of commercial
disputes. However,
in most respects these streams
behave in more or less the same way. In such cases
the law makes general provision for rules of litigation
that apply equally to each one of them. One such pro-
vision is the law relating to summary judgment.

The idea behind summary judgment is simple and
brilliant. The courts must be available to hear all claims
and all defences, regardless of their legal strength. Yet
some claims and defences are so manifestly incapable
of being sustained that it would be wrong to commit
the courtsâ€™ resources to resolving them. These include
claims that, even if fully proven, disclose no cause of
action, as well as defences that are not relevant to the
action because they do not rebut the basis of the clai-
mantâ€™s case and defences that cannot be realistically
substantiated. If a summary procedure can be initiated
with a view to testing the immediate ability of a party

judgment and the striking out of untenable
claims and defences enable the courts to process
disputed cases more efficiently.

 In most intellectual property litigation, disputes
are heard by a specialist judge: this is, however,
often not the case with applications for summary
judgment and striking out.

 The consideration of three applications heard
by the same non-specialist judge raises issues as
to whether specialist and non-specialist judges
might reach different decisions on the same facts.

comparing the performance of specialist intel-

and non-specialist
judges in summary cases.

the more cases that are disposed of upstream of the

deal with the other cases on their lists;

false hopes and unrealistic expectations of parties

allowed to persist;

the less time, effort, and money will be expended by
the litigant who is in the right (legally speaking) in

the sooner is removed the degree of uncertainty
attached to such important items as (i) the viability
of a business plan, (ii) the validity of an intellectual
property right, (iii) the safeguarding of know-how,
and (iv) the safeguarding of the ability to commun-
icate unprotected information;

the fewer cases that go to a full trial, the lower is the
demand for the recruitment of members of the
legal profession to enter the judiciary or for the
conscription of deputy judges to absorb the excess
volume of disputes that cannot be settled before
trial.

So long as the law is properly applied, upstream
resolution of disputes has no serious disadvantages,
at least so far as the courts and litigants are con-
cerned. Net
losers include lawyers who lose the
opportunity to bill clients for time unnecessarily
expended in court and those who object
that
upstream dispute resolution diminishes the stock of
judgments that are potentially reportable and thus
useful as precedents. Where summary judgment is
available but is not sought, and where it is sought
but not granted, the parties will be little or no worse
off than if that relief were not available in the first
place. Only where summary judgment is ordered
when it should not be or refused when it should be
granted will the system inflict any detriment, to the
extent that (i) the cost of seeking summary judgment
will have been expended in vain or (ii) further
litigation-prolonging applications and appeal proce-
dures may be invoked in order to rectify errors in
the operation of a summary judgment-based system.

2. Rules and expectations
Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) lays down
the rules that enable the courts to give summary judg-
ment. These rules are striking in their simplicity and
economy of expression. They establish a small num-
ber of conditions that must be observed if a court is
to give judgment where the claimant â€˜has no real pro-
spect of succeeding on the claim or issueâ€™ or where
the defendant â€˜has no real prospect of defending the
claim or issueâ€™, so long as there is â€˜no other com-
pelling reason why the case or issue should be dis-
posed of at trialâ€™.1 The application of the CPR is
itself governed by what is termed â€˜the overriding

objectiveâ€™, that is, the objective of â€˜enabling the court
to deal with cases justlyâ€™.2 We can thus postulate the
following propositions:

(i) Where there is a prospect of a party succeeding
on a claim or issue, there is no power to order
summary judgment.

(ii) Where there is no prospect of a party succeeding,
the power to order summary judgment exists,
subject to there being no other compelling reason
why the case should be disposed of at trial.

(iii)Again, where there is no prospect of a party suc-
ceeding, the power to order summary judgment
will not be exercised if to do so would be contrary
to the overriding objective.

From this it appears that a party who seeks to resist
an application for summary judgment has three
routes from which to choose: (i) he can establish
that he has a chance of success; (ii) he can establish
a compelling reason why,
irrespective of success,
summary judgment should not be given; or (iii) he
can establish that summary judgment would be con-
trary to the overriding objective.

At least three factors militate against the litigation
of vacuous and unsustainable issues in intellectual
property disputes. They are the deterrent effect of
the expense and effort
involved in bringing (or
defending) an action in the first place, the equally
deterrent effect of the risk of having to bear a large
order for costs, and the increasing use of case man-
agement as a means of enabling the parties to focus
on the most decisive issues in the most effective man-
ner. These factors are not unique to intellectual prop-
erty law but may be accentuated in certain areas
within that field. They include

the ability of specialist intellectual property lawyers
to command high fees;

scope of both this and indeed any other review of the topic.

the frequency with which, in infringement litiga-
tion, complex issues unrelated to the proof of
allegedly infringing acts may legitimately be raised
(eg the validity of the claimantâ€™s registered right,
the scope of applicability of defences that are
couched in imprecise terms, and the potential
liability of the claimant or any other party for

the technological basis of proceedings, which may
lie well outside the experience of even specialist
professional representatives and which will require
the court
to receive instruction in technically
advanced areas of science.

Bearing in mind these three factors, resistance to
well-founded applications for summary judgment
should usually be hopeless. Applications are, how-
ever, made with very much more frequency than
they are granted. This may be for tactical reasons
(where either party may seek to reduce the number
of issues being raised in complex proceedings or to
seek to force the pace in determining which issues
should be regarded as they key ones) or for psycho-
logical ones (where one party seeks to depress an
adversary who may be in some doubt as to the
strength of his or her own case or who may be waver-
ing as to whether it is worth committing resources to
a full hearing on the merits).

3. In pursuit of the Hart
Over a period of four weeks in early 2005, three
applications for summary judgment in intellectual
property disputes came before Mr Justice Hart. This
article proposes to examine them as a microcosm of
summary judgment litigation as a whole and then to
consider their significance to the small but intimate
world of intellectual property law.

fact

that

Before considering the three cases,

it is worth
considering the
they were heard by
Mr Justice Hart. The overwhelmingly preponderant
majority of disputes concerning intellectual property
in the United Kingdom are adjudicated in specialist
tribunals:
these are the Patents Court and the
Patents County Court, the Comptroller of Patents,
the Trade Mark Registry, the Design Registry, the
Lord Chancellorâ€™s Appointed Person,
and the
Copyright Tribunal.3 Additionally, clients are gener-
ally representedâ€”particularly in legally complex or
commercially valuable casesâ€”by specialized profes-
sions (patent agents, trade mark attorneys), by spe-
cialized members of the legal profession at large
(solicitors, barristers), or by both.4 The concentration
of dispute resolution within these bodies and the
experiences gained by those involved might reason-
ably be expected to inculcate in the minds of all con-
cerned a shared expectation as to which sorts of
claims or issues are inherently viable, which may
with effort be given sustenance, which are raised
by way of ritual and without any sense of sincere
to their being argued,5 and which,
commitment
however one views them, have no plausible chance
of success.

Mr Justice Hart, as the arbiter of the three recent
applications discussed here, is something of an out-
sider in this close and intimate world of shared
vocabulary, conceptual toolkit, and expectation of
probabilities, although he is certainly not a complete
stranger to it. Empirical evidence suggests that some-
thing like 5 per cent of his case load over the past
seven years has at least some degree of intellectual
property content.6 Although he is not one of the
five judges currently designated as members of the
Patents Court, he is a relatively senior Chancery Divi-
sion judge and has sat on occasion as a member of
the Court of Appeal.

3 While there is no specialist tribunal for litigation of trade mark infringe-
ment claims, the Patents Court judges within the High courtâ€™s Chancery
Division are generally seized of such cases. Community trade mark cases
are heard in the United Kingdom by the Chancery Division (where they
normally come before the same specialist judges that comprise the Patents
Court) and by the Patents County Court.

4 Hearings before the Design Registry are exceptional, in that about 70% of

applicants are unrepresented.

5 A perfect example of ritual claims may be found in trade mark opposition
proceedings before the Trade Mark Registry, where until the turn of the
century a plea based on the trade mark applicantâ€™s bad faith was routinely
raised but rarely substantiated by the opponent or considered by the hear-
ing officer.

6 Of 141 cases noted on the Lawtel subscription-based legal information ser-
vice as having been before Hart J as a High Court or make-weight Court of
Appeal judge between May 1998 and 20 April 2005, just 7 involved intellec-
tual property issues. In contrast, the senior Patents Court judge Laddie J
heard 110 cases designated as involving â€˜intellectual propertyâ€™, out of a
total of 201 cases (55 per cent). These figures may be artificially low, since
cases involving intellectual property may also be concealed under rubrics
such as â€˜information technologyâ€™, â€˜competition lawâ€™, and â€˜civil procedureâ€™.
Other Patents Court judges may hear a lower proportion of intellectual
property cases, though. Between May 2003 and April 2005 Pumfrey J heard
86 cases, of which 42 were in the field of intellectual property (just under
49 per cent). From his appointment in May 2003 to April 2005 Lewison J
heard just 15 intellectual property cases out of 60 (25 per cent).

Jeremy Phillips Â· Summary judgment in intellectual property litigationâ€”The three of Harts

ARTICLE

4. The three of Harts
The three cases that form the basis of this analysis are
as follows.

(i) Lâ€™Oreal SA and others v Ballure NV and others.7
This trade mark infringement and passing-off
action was commenced by the owner of a number
of perfume trade marks, who sought to prevent the
distribution and sale of â€˜smell-alikeâ€™ products that
bore some superficial similarity to its own prod-
ucts. The defendants applied to have it struck
out on the basis that there was no apparent simi-
larity between the partiesâ€™ respective trade marks.
Hart J refused to strike out the claims despite his
admission that he could see no similarity at all
between various of the trade marks and signs in
dispute.

(ii) Experience Hendrix LLC v Purple Haze Records Ltd
and another.8 The defendant raised a complex edi-
fice of legal arguments and attempted to maintain
both on the law and on the facts that its commercial
exploitation of a sound recording of an old Jimi
Hendrix performance
that had been made
abroad did not infringe copyright in that sound
recording. The claimant sought and was granted
summary judgment. The arguments that, Hart J
concluded, could not be sustained included sub-
missions based on business efficacy and on the
construction of a contract upon which the defen-
dants sought to rely, as well as upon intellectual
property law.

(iii)IPC Media Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd.9
This application arose from the reproduction, in
the pages of The Sun newspaper, of the entire
front page of IPCâ€™s TV listings magazine. This
reproduction, as well as that of another title,
was within part of an advertisement for a compet-
ing title published by The Sunâ€™s owners. In an
action for copyright infringement, Hart J gave
summary judgment, notwithstanding The Sunâ€™s
argument that the reproduction of the coverâ€™s art-
work and logo was a fair dealing for the purpose
of criticism or review.

Each of these decisions will now be critically exam-
ined in the context of the terms of the CPR, the over-
riding objective, and the commercial realities that
underlay the disputes. The object of the exercise is

not to attack the judge, nor is it to criticize the legal
provisions that he was invited to apply. Rather, it
is to pose two questions and offer answers to them:
(i) how effective are the rules relating to summary
judgment
in intellectual property disputes and
(ii) could we have expected the application of those
rules to be different if the role of applying them had
fallen to a trial judge who was a member of the intel-
lectual property tribe rather than a relative outsider?

Lâ€™Oreal SA and others v Ballure NV and
others

justly,

If the overriding objective is that of dealing with
cases
this decision is hard to justify in
terms of its inter partes content. It may, however, be
viewed, from a utilitarian perspective, as sacrificing
the need to deal justly in this instance in order to
create a platform upon which a higher quality of just-
ice may be achieved between other disputants in the
future.

The problem in this case was that the claimant
commenced proceedings for trade mark infringement
and passing off in respect of acts of the defendant
that were more properly categorized as acts of unfair
competition. Actions may be brought in the United
Kingdom for trade mark infringement and for pass-
ing off, but unfair competition is not recognized as
a cause of action10. In a recent obiter comment, a
Court of Appeal judge suggested that the time has
come for English passing-off law to be more appro-
priately categorized as a tort of unfair competition,11

and there seems no doubt but that it was the inten-
tion of the claimant to found its action upon that
suggestion and to take it to an appellate court for
that purpose.

themselves developed by case law,

By refusing to strike out an apparently untenable
action in order that
the claimant be given the
opportunity to create new law, Hart J has struck a
bold blow on behalf of those who support the prin-
ciple of judicial creativity and who wish to see the
judiciary given the opportunity to modify flexible
principles,
in
accordance with current commercial needs and con-
temporary standards of fairness. Yet the defendant
might understandably complain â€˜Why me?â€™ when
forced to defend an action that, on the law as it
stands, has no chance of succeeding in order that it
be given the opportunity to be the unsuccessful
party in appellate proceedings if the claimant per-
suades the courts to make new law. The overriding
principle does not appear to support the sacrifice
of even the most morally unworthy of defendants
for this purpose.

Experience Hendrix LLC v Purple Haze
Records Ltd and another

In this instance the claimant was the assignee of the
estate of the late musician Jimi Hendrix. Its action
for infringement of performersâ€™ rights was met by
defences based both on legal submissions and on con-
siderations of
fact. The claimantâ€™s application for
summary judgment succeeded.
In dismissing the
defendantâ€™s legal submissions that (i) the claimant
companyâ€™s performances did not qualify for legal
protection and that (ii) an individual who partici-
pated in a groupâ€™s performance did not enjoy an indi-
vidual right in his performance, Hart J acted in a bold
and decisive manner since those submissions, which
were of no genuine substance, were couched in terms
that might have led him to conclude that they were at
least arguable.

In contrast, the courtâ€™s treatment of the defences
based on factual submissions might seem surprising.
Hart J concluded that on its true construction an
agreement between Hendrix and a third party, upon
which the defendant sought to rely, contained no
assignment or agreement to assign the relevant rights
that it allegedly infringed. Nor, the judge held, was
it necessary to imply into that contract a term to

that effect in order to give the agreement business
efficacy.

By the time a judge, on an application for sum-
mary judgment, is contemplating issues such as the
need to imply a term into a side contract for the
sake of business efficacy, it would appear that he is
delving into issues of relative detail almost to the
point at which the application for summary judgment
has become a replacement for the trial itself. Strictly
speaking, there is no reason why this should not be
done if the result of this operation is to determine
that the defence has no â€˜real prospect of succeeding

property infringements have recently appeared to
take the line that summary judgment will not be
ordered where the defence, though weak and unlikely
to succeed at trial,12 is at least arguable even when it

thought that the defence in this case would belong
in that same category.

arguableâ€™17 but nonetheless considered that there was
no prospect of it succeeding. Counsel for the defendant
further argued that facts might emerge at trial that
would â€˜assist the right balance that might be struckâ€™
and that this might be a reason for deferring a decision
on the fair dealing issue, but the judge was unper-
suaded that this might be the case since the defendant
had hitherto failed to produce any comparable exam-
ple of the usage that, it claimed, was fair and since the
defendantâ€™s use of the claimantâ€™s magazine cover was
not so much a use for the purposes of criticism or
review as a taking advantage of the fact that the claim-
ant had created a visual identity for its product.18

5. What do these decisions tell us
about the effectiveness of
summary orders?
In this admittedly far-from-representative sample of
cases, two involved the grant of summary judgment
in favour of a claimant intellectual property owner
and in the third an application to strike out claims
made by an intellectual property owner was dis-
missed. This looks like good news for the intellectual
property owners, but
is for further empirical
research to establish whether the operation of the
laws relating to summary orders and striking out gen-
erally works in favour of intellectual property owners.
There is certainly no explicit requirement that those
rules should do so.

As a side note, the European Court of Justice has
mentioned that
is preferable for trade mark-
granting authorities to take a strict view of the applica-
tion of absolute grounds for the refusal of a trade mark
application rather than allow the grant of weak or

currently generous

doubtful trade marks and leave it to third parties to
rely upon the
selection of
defences if they should be faced with an action for
infringement.19 The reason for this is that powerful
commercial entities with weak trade marks should
not be able to bully smaller commercial entities by
commencing unmeritorious litigation against them.
Where a court is swift to enter summary judgment
on behalf of a claimant but reluctant to strike out a
probably unmeritorious claim, the wisdom of the
European Court of
Justiceâ€™s position must be
recognized.

6. What do these decisions tell
us about the effectiveness of
non-specialist judges?
It is apparent from the transcripts of the three deci-
sions that Hart J is an attentive, intelligent, rational,
and conscientious judge. In these particular cases he
has also received the benefit of clearly articulated sub-
missions by counsel, which have left no doubt as to
the issues to be resolved. On the evidence the only
virtue that he can be said to lack is the sort of famil-
iarity with intellectual property law that is acquired
only by regular exposure to it. Without wishing to
draw the conclusion that his conclusions in the three
cases under review are incorrect, it is submitted that
each is a conclusion that lies contrary to what a regu-
lar specialist intellectual property judge would have
been expected to reach.

for summary judgment should be heard by specialist
judges. For example,

 From a psychological point of view it may be imag-
ined that both litigants and professional representa-
tives will feel more at home before a judge who
has practised or who has had extensive judicial
experience of the area from which the dispute has
arisen.

 Specialist judges may be expected to require a lower
degree of instruction by counsel, thus reducing the
time spent hearing and determining applications.

There may be a greater disincentive to appeal against
a decision of a specialist judge than against that of a
relative stranger to the field of law.

7. Conclusions
At a time when there is a strong demand for the
administration of justice to be both effective and
swift, the twin facility of entering summary judgment
and striking out is likely to remain attractive and
popular with intellectual property litigants. However,
it is a facility that should not be abused.

The employment of non-specialist judges for the
purpose of determining whether that facility should
be utilized may produce results that, if justifiable,
may run counter to the intuition of those who spe-
cialize in the field. Accordingly, judicial practice in
regard should be carefully monitored and

decision-making are to prevail.

suggestion is itself misconceived for several reasons.
For example:
 The dispute may be one that turns on evidential
or other issues that are unaffected by a judgeâ€™s
lack of familiarity with the area of law in question.
 There may not be a single identifiable â€˜correctâ€™
solution, since the judge may be asked to choose
between two or more solutions that are technically
acceptable on the facts and submissions of law
before him.



Judicial reasoning may also be influenced by vari-
ables such as the quality of the submissions made
on behalf of the parties, the urgency of the need
to make a ruling, and the current status of other
disputes between the same parties.

 The recent experience of the Patents Court, which
the past decade has recruited numerous
over
intellectual property lawyers20 to
non-specialist
join its ranks, does not suggest that the quality
of decision-making of those judges is seriously
deficient.

There may even be good reason to dilute the
impact of a concentration of specialist judges within
a single area of
legal expertise. For example, the
employment of a wider pool of judges to try intellec-
tual property cases will subject decisions of specialist
judges
thus
possibly providing a â€˜reality checkâ€™ against which
intellectual property precedents and practices may
be measured.
