ABSTRACT
This  article  examines  the  question  of  authenticity  in  relation  to  3D 
visualisation  of  historic  objects  and  monuments.  Much  of  the  literature 
locates their authenticity in the accuracy of the data and/or the realism of 
the resulting models. Yet critics argue that 3D visualisations undermine the 
experience  of  authenticity,  disrupting  people’s  access  to  the  materiality, 
biography  and  aura  of  their  historic  counterparts.  The  ACCORD  project 
takes questions of authenticity and 3D visualisation into a new arena – that 
of community heritage practice – and uses rapid ethnographic methods 
to examine whether and how such visualisations acquire authenticity. The 
results demonstrate that subtle forms of migration and borrowing occur 
between the original and the digital, creating new forms of authenticity 
associated with the digital object. Likewise, the creation of digital models 
mediates the authenticity and status of their original counterparts through 
the networks of relations in which they are embedded. The current pre-
occupation  with  the  binary  question  of  whether  3D  digital  models  are 
authentic or not obscures the wider work that such objects do in respect 
to  the  cultural  politics  of  ownership,  attachment,  place-making  and 
regeneration.  The  article  both  advances  theoretical  debates  and  has 
important implications for heritage visualisation practice.

Introduction

Media forms are constantly calling into question each other’s ability to represent the authentic, and these reme-
diations raise the possibility of the decay of aura, the loss of authenticity of experience. (Bolter et al. 2006, 34)

Authenticity has long been seen as an intrinsic and immutable dimension of tangible historic objects, 
monuments and landscapes; an integral aspect of their significance, their truthfulness, and their genu-
ineness. In authorised museum and heritage discourses, there has been an overwhelming emphasis on 
material authenticity, with the integrity or ‘true’ nature of objects defined in relation to their origins, 
provenance and fabric (Cameron 2007, 52; Jones 2010, 184). In contrast, the authenticity of physical 
replicas and reconstructions has a much more chequered and ambivalent history (Foster and Curtis 
2016; Fyfe 2004; Rabinowitz 2015). Whilst fluctuating according to their modes of production, accu-
racy, institutional associations and biographical trajectories, their authenticity and value are almost

always seen as secondary, and indeed a potential threat, to the original objects they represent. Digital 
visualisations of historic objects and monuments, which can be seen as virtual replicas or reconstruc-
tions, often acquire a similarly complex and ambivalent status (Cameron 2007). However, recent 
research suggests that apparently clear cut distinctions between originals and replicas, both physical 
and digital, are far more complex.

The extent to which the authenticity of originals is intrinsic and immutable has been questioned. 
It has been argued that authenticity is in large part culturally constructed, being constituted through 
regimes of value associated with authorising institutions such as museums, art galleries and the inter-
national art market (Bruner 2007; Holtorf and Schadla-Hall 1999; Lindholm 2008). In terms of the 
experience of authenticity, aging, patina and material decay are also important, creating a diffuse 
sense of ‘pastness’ (Douglas-Jones et al. 2016; Holtorf 2013). Finally, ethnographic research reveals 
that authenticity is produced and negotiated through networks of relationships between people, places 
and things (Dicks 2000; Jones 2010; Jones and Yarrow 2013; Macdonald 2013).

Just as the intrinsic authenticity and value of originals is problematised, so the inauthenticity of 
replicas has been questioned. From various perspectives, studies have shown that physical replicas can 
acquire authenticity and value, depending on their modes of production and consumption, and the 
networks of institutional and individual relations they are embedded in (e.g. Foster and Curtis 2016; 
Holtorf and Schadla-Hall 1999; Latour and Lowe 2011). Likewise in debates surrounding digital media, 
the idea that virtual representations signal the end of authenticity has been challenged (e.g. Cameron 
2007; Gillings 2005; Jeffrey 2015), or at least reconfigured as ‘the experience of aura is alternately called 
into question and reaffirmed’ (Bolter et al. 2006, 22).

In this article, we examine the question of authenticity in relation to digital visualisation of his-
toric objects and monuments in the context of participatory community practices. We draw on the 
results of the innovative ACCORD project (Archaeological Community Co-Production of Research 
Resources), which examined the opportunities and implications of collaborative, community-based, 
digital recording and modelling, using the techniques of photogrammetry and reflectance transfor-
mation imaging. The methodologies underpinning community co-design and co-production in the 
ACCORD Project are discussed in detail elsewhere (Jeffrey et al. 2015), whilst another article focuses 
on their role in the production of value and sense of place (Jeffrey et al. In Prep). Here we use the 
rapid ethnographic research conducted alongside the project to explore the relationship between 3D 
digital models and authenticity.

This research provides a substantial body of qualitative evidence demonstrating that digital objects 
can acquire authenticity and value; something that until now has been largely confined to theoretical 
propositions. Whilst distinctions between originals and 3D models are upheld, the research shows 
that it is a mistake to view these in terms of fixed attributes. Rather digital records and objects become 
bound up in complex and dynamic networks of relationships. Importantly, these allow for subtle 
forms of migration and borrowing, alongside the generation of new forms of value and authenticity. 
The community co-design and co-production employed in the ACCORD project is a key part of this 
process, creating relationships between people, places and objects often expressed in forms of identity 
and belonging. Thus, whilst much of the literature on the authenticity and value of digital media focuses 
on accuracy, resolution, aesthetics and consumption (see Bolter et al. 2006; Garstki 2016), this research 
shows that modes of production and participatory practice are equally if not more important. The 
results challenge received assumptions about authenticity and new digital media, and advance related 
philosophical and theoretical debates. They also have important ramifications for the application of 
digital heritage visualisation in practice.

Authenticity and digital representation
Before turning to the ACCORD project in detail, we interrogate the current debates surrounding digital 
media and authenticity in more depth and explain our approach to these issues. Broadly speaking, 
authenticity refers to the quality of being authentic, that is, real, original, truthful, or genuine; ‘really

proceeding from its stated source’ (Oxford English Dictionary 2002, 153). Authorised heritage and 
museum discourses still treat authenticity as something intrinsic to historic buildings, monuments 
and objects; and lacking or derivative in the case of replicas. As noted in the introduction, construc-
tivist critiques have dismantled this distinction to some extent, but the intimate relationship between 
materiality and conceptions of authenticity remains firm. Historic fabric is objectified as a container of 
authenticity and a battery of techniques applied to differentiating the ‘real’ or ‘genuine’, from the ‘fake’. 
Indeed, even recent research challenging essentialist notions of authenticity suggests that the specific 
biographies and materialities of historic objects are important in how people experience and negotiate 
authenticity (e.g. Holtorf 2013; Jones 2010, 2016). In particular, weathering and patina are significant 
elements in people’s experience of authenticity (Douglas-Jones et al. 2016). It is not surprising therefore 
that the ‘weirdness’ of digital objects creates questions about their authenticity (Jeffrey 2015, 147). 
Lacking either physical substance, or a specific physical locale, they can seem like otherworldly, free 
floating representations. Furthermore, whilst they can offer a representation of the physical signs of age, 
digital objects themselves appear impervious to the ravages of time, even bearing infinite reproduction 
apparently without attenuation (Jeffrey 2015). For these reasons their authenticity is regarded with sus-
picion and their existence is even seen as a threat to the unique, ‘original’ historic forms they represent.
The work of Benjamin has been particularly influential in debates about digital authenticity (Bolter 
et al. 2006; Cameron 2007; Garstki 2016; Jeffrey 2015; Rabinowitz 2015). Writing in the early twentieth 
century in response to new technological developments such as photography and cinema, Benjamin 
argued that mechanical reproduction undermines the uniqueness of the original art object, which 
in turn leads to the decay of aura, along with the sense of awe and reverence associated with it. For 
Benjamin ([1936] 1969, 221) the aura or authenticity of a thing:

… is the essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging to its substantive duration to its testi-
mony to the history it has experienced. Since the historical testimony rests on the authenticity, the former, too 
is jeopardized by reproduction when substantive duration ceases to matter.

The authenticity of an object is thus associated with its unique position in space and time, and the 
biography  it  encapsulates.  Although  Benjamin  highlighted  the  liberatory  political  possibilities  of 
mechanical reproduction, those applying his ideas to mass digital media have focused primarily on 
its potential to destabilise the ‘real’ and the ‘true’ (Cameron 2007, 50–51). Digital models and vis-
ualisations of historic objects, buildings and monuments are often portrayed as inauthentic ‘digital 
terrorists’ (Cameron 2007, 51), or in a more positive sense useful surrogate records that remain highly 
dependent on their physical referents. In this latter sense, the degree of accuracy, objectivity, and/or 
realism of digital records and visualisations inevitably remain key preoccupations, notwithstanding 
their separation and distinction from their tangible counterparts (e.g. Garstki 2016; Rabinowitz 2015).
Nevertheless, as noted in our introduction these hard and fast distinctions between digital his-
torical objects and their physical counterparts have been challenged. In their work on physical cop-
ies of artworks produced through intermediary digital techniques, Latour and Lowe (2011) directly 
challenge Benjamin’s thesis, arguing that some part of the aura of the original object can ‘migrate’ to 
its replicas. They propose that some forms of replication facilitate this migration more than others 
and much depends on the different degrees of effort, cost and technological sophistication employed 
(Latour and Lowe 2011, 7–8). They also argue that the physical and cultural contexts in which copies 
are encountered are important in determining the degree to which they acquire aura or authenticity 
(Latour and Lowe 2011, 10–11). Jeffrey (2015, 148) builds on Latour and Lowe’s argument and pro-
poses that aura can also migrate to digital copies in and of themselves, through both attention to the 
aesthetics of digital visualisations and, foreshadowing this research, active community participation 
in their production. Others in turn have suggested that digital historical objects can accrue their own 
forms of authenticity or aura over time, because ‘the digital historical object is a creative work in its 
own right with a history and provenance’ (Cameron 2007, 67).

The ACCORD project sheds new light on the question of if, when, and how digital 3D historic 
objects acquire authenticity. Our focus is on how people experience authenticity in relation to 3D 

336

models. Thus, we are not concerned with characteristics such as accuracy, objectivity and realism 
per se, except in so far as they inform the production and negotiation of authenticity. We also treat 
aura as a specific aspect of the experience of authenticity related to biographical uniqueness and a 
simultaneous sense of distance and connection associated with heritage objects; what one of us has 
referred to as the ‘thrill of proximity’ (Jeffrey 2015, 147). In addition to exploring whether or not digital 
3D visualisations of historic objects, monuments and places can acquire authenticity or aura, we also 
ask what these visualisations do. In what ways do they impact on the authenticity of their ‘original’ 
counterparts and their ongoing biographical trajectories? Furthermore, to what extent do they create, 
extend and/or reinforce networks of relations between people, places and things, and in so doing medi-
ate the experience of authenticity (cf. Jones 2010; Jones and Yarrow 2013; Macdonald 1997b, 2013)?
Before we examine these questions in more depth, we discuss the research practices and methodol-
ogies used in the ACCORD project, starting with a brief summary of approaches to digital visualisation 
and public engagement. We then introduce the community heritage groups that participated in the 
project and the heritage places that were recorded and modelled.

The ACCORD project: research practices and methodologies
After more than 3 decades of research and development, digital visualisation techniques, including 
laser scanning, photogrammetry, and reflectance transformation imaging, are now ubiquitous in the 
archaeology, heritage and museum sectors. However, the use of these techniques remains largely in 
the domain of expert forms of knowledge, informed by academic research agendas and/or professional 
priorities. The London Charter for Computer-Based Visualisation of Cultural Heritage encapsulates 
this in its principles, which are intended as a ‘benchmark’ to ensure intellectual and technical rigour 
(Londoncharter.org 2009). There is a body of work relating to the use of digital media, including 3D 
recording and modelling, for communication, education and public engagement (for a review see 
King, Stark, and Cooke 2016). However, much of this is pre-occupied with access to, and dissemina-
tion of, academically or professionally produced records and visualisations, again as exemplified by 
the London Charter (see section on ‘access’). A number of projects have made significant advances in 
developing forms of archiving and presentation that facilitate active visitor/public engagement (King, 
Stark, and Cooke 2016, 90–93), of which the Ename project was an early pioneer with its focus on 
interactive, collaborative storytelling (Pletinckx, Silberman, and Callebaut 2003). Yet, even in such 
cases, the production of the digital data and visualisations involved remains predominantly in the 
hands of academic researchers or museum and heritage professionals, aided by interpreters, designers 
and digital technologists.

In recent years, projects founded on citizen science and crowdsourcing have contributed to greater 
public/community participation in the production of digital material in heritage and museum contexts 
(for a discussion see King et al. [2016], Simon [2010], and contributions to Kalay et al. eds [2008]). 
MicroPasts, a web-enabled, crowd-sourcing project (micropasts.org) is a prominent example in the 
museum sector. It brings together full-time academic researchers, volunteer archaeological and his-
torical societies and other interested members of the public to create research data (Bonacchi et al. 
2014). Tasks include helping to locate artefact findspots, identifying subject matter in historic archives, 
masking photos for 3D modelling, or transcribing letters and catalogues. However, more often than 
not, the nature of the digital research data, the role of participants, and the types of heritage involved 
in such projects are defined by academic researchers and/or museum and heritage professionals. 
Thus, in the few publications focusing on the potential of photogrammetry for facilitating community 
engagement with heritage, much of the emphasis is on training and the creation of a record of heritage 
assets (e.g. Bryan and Chandler 2008; McCarthy 2014), perpetuating expert authority in similar ways 
to many community archaeology projects (Smith and Waterton 2009). Furthermore, the social and 
communal values associated with the historic artefacts, monuments and places being recorded are 
rarely incorporated into the project design, let alone the creation of digital research data.

In contrast, the ACCORD project team worked with ten community heritage groups across Scotland 
to create 3D records and models of heritage places of significance to them (Figure 1). The aim was to 
examine the opportunities and implications of digital visualisation technologies for community her-
itage practice using co-design and co-production of 3D models of historic monuments. Popular in a 
range of design, planning and healthcare environments, co-design and co-production methodologies 
are intended to decentre traditional relationships of power, control and expertise between researchers 
and volunteers, or ‘professionals’ and ‘non-professionals’ (Burr and Matthews 2008; Conroy, Clarke, 
and Wilson 2012; Cottam and Leadbeater 2006; Davies 2010). Whilst not without their challenges and 
shortcomings, these methodologies produce more symmetrical relationships between participants at 
the same time as facilitating critical reflection on the power relationships involved (see Maxwell [2017] 
for further discussion in the context of ACCORD; also Lynch and Alberti [2010]).

In terms of digital visualisation technologies, ‘consumer-level’ photogrammetry (structure from 
motion) and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (hereafter RTI) were used, because they are more 
accessible than other techniques and thus facilitate participation. Depending on the outcomes of the 
co-design process, time of flight laser scanning was sometimes also deployed, for example for large-
scale recording. 3D printing technology was used in select cases to create physical models from the cap-
tured data. The digital data and models resulting from the project have been permanently archived on 
an open-access basis archived with Archaeology Data Service (doi: https://doi.org/10.5284/1042733). 
Issues relating to open-data and ownership of the resulting assets (intellectual property and copyright) 
were openly negotiated with the community groups, usually resulting in use of Creative Commons

A distinctive aspect of the ACCORD project is that ‘co-design’ encouraged community participants 
to take an active role in the selection of recording ‘targets’ and technologies, with particular attention 
to the significance of heritage places, and the social and communal values associated with them. These 
social and communal values were also recorded and archived with the digital models. Furthermore, 
key research objectives included an exploration of the impact of community co-design and co-pro-
duction on the value and authenticity of both the digital models and their original counterparts. For 
this purpose, we used qualitative research methods associated with rapid or focused ethnography, 
which are usually charcterised by short time-frames, mixed methods, multi-disciplinary teams, and 
forms of active intervention to create ‘intense routes to knowing’ (Pink and Morgan 2013, 351; also 
Knoblauch 2005). As Pink and Morgan (2013, 352) put it:

[Rapid ethnography] involves intensive excursions into [people’s] lives, which use more interventional as well as 
observational methods to create contexts through which to delve into questions that will reveal matters to those 
people in the context of what the researcher is seeking to find out.
In the case of the ACCORD project, the co-design and co-production of 3D records provides an 
entry point or ‘intervention’ around which qualitative research was conducted. Our work with each 
group started and finished with focused group interviews (see Finch, Lewis, and Turley 2014), which 
acted as points of intensive discursive enquiry where background knowledge could be obtained, and 
concepts and experiences relevant to the project explored and probed. The discussion was ‘focused’ by 
the project team through the use of a semi-structured interview design, but this was used flexibly to allow 
participants to use their own frames and concepts and to pursue their own priorities. Furthermore, the 
project team encouraged participants to talk to one another: ‘asking questions, exchanging anecdotes, and 
commenting on each others’ experiences and points of view’ (Kitzinger and Barbour 1999, 4). We also 
used participant observation during the co-design and co-production of the digital records and models, 
which facilitated intensive observation of these ‘situated performances’ (Knoblauch 2005, para 28).

In synopsis, the ACCORD team spent 2–3 intensive days working with each of the 10 community 
groups and the various methodologies were combined in 4 distinct phases (see Figure 2). Phase 1 
consisted of the first focused group interview with those members of the community heritage group 
who wished to engage in the accord project (Figure 1(c)). This was designed to elicit discussion about 
the nature and formation of the heritage group, their interests and attachments, the heritage prac-
tices they ordinarily engage in, and the meanings and values associated with specific historic objects, 
monuments and places.

Phase 2 focused on co-design of the 3D recording and modelling activities. This phase consisted 
of a continuation of the phase 1 focus group, identifying and discussing targets and technologies for 
3D visualisation, often with the aid of images and maps (see Figures 6(a) and (c) below). In addition, 
co-design often entailed direct engagement with landscapes of attachment in the form of site visits 
and story telling (Figure 1(b), also Figure 5(b) below). Community participants and research team 
members worked together, taking into account the interests of the community heritage group, as well 
as the objectives of the ACCORD project.

Phase 3 focused on co-production, starting with field recording and then progressing to data pro-
cessing and modelling. Community participants had different levels of photographic and IT proficiency, 
with only a handful of individuals across all of the groups with any prior experience of photogram-
metry, let alone the other techniques. Members of the project team brought technical expertise and 
experience to the co-production, but a collaborative ethos was actively promoted with community 
participants engaged in photographic recording (Figure 1(a)), screening and lighting for RTI (Figure 
1(d)), clearing vegetation, strategic discussion and management of data. Data-processing and mod-
elling were initiated by project staff, but wherever possible conducted in the company of community 
participants with as much participation as possible (see Figure 5(d) below). This phase also stimulated 
reflection and discussion mediated by close engagement with heritage places and direct experience 
of the recording practices.

Phase 4 involved another focused group interview, this time exploring the significance, value and 
authenticity of the 3D visualisations, as well as their relations with the tangible objects and places 
they represent. Where forms of attachment and ownership surfaced these were actively explored, as 
were the aesthetics of the virtual forms produced. Discussion also focused on the practices involved 
and the experience of co-design and co-production. Finally, the ways in which participation in 3D 
visualisation impacted on the interests and attachments of those involved was considered.

Throughout the four phases, project team members were participant observers. Jones and Maxwell, 
in particular took the lead in terms of this overarching ethnographic research, keeping field notes to 
record observations, experiences and conversations. Phases 2 and 3, where project team members and 
community participants engaged in collaborative practices, were particularly productive in this regard. 
Direct engagement with landscapes, monuments and objects during co-design and co-production often 
stimulated conversations and debates that provided insights into group dynamics and the ways in which 
value and authenticity are negotiated in practice. Participant observation also allowed the project team 
to gain an understanding of community participants’ changing attitudes to 3D technologies and the 
resulting visualisations. Thus the ACCORD methodology created intense research encounters that 
brought theoretical questions into focus within an ethnographic arena (Pink and Morgan 2013, 357), 
including those relating to significance, value and authenticity.

Places of significance: community heritage practices and 3D visualisation
The ACCORD project involved a diverse range of community groups largely drawn from pre-ex-
isting relationships with project partners. Half were recruited from Archaeology Scotland’s Adopt-
a-Monument Scheme, a five-year community-led scheme (with some 55 self-subscribed groups), 

340

which supports and facilitates local groups across Scotland wishing to conserve and promote their 
local heritage. An open call through the Scheme enlisted 5 groups to participate in ACCORD (Access 
Archaeology; Ardnamurchan Community Archaeology Group; Bressay History Group; Colintraive 
and Gendaruel History & Archaeology Group; The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis). We recruited a 
further group through Glasgow Life’s community outreach scheme (Castlemilk’s How Old Are Yew?) 
and one through the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (now 
part of Historic Environment Scotland (HES)) (the rock climbers at Dunbarton Rock). The remaining 
3 out of 10 ACCORD groups were recruited through academic and professional colleagues of the 
project team who were working with community archaeology or heritage groups (The Kircudbright 
History Society; The Rhynie Woman Group; Tarbat dig/Clan McFarlene Group).

The ten groups vary considerably in their nature, interests, size and longevity (see Table 1 for 
details). They include archaeology and history societies, as well as more informal groups with a strong 
emphasis on practical investigation, conservation and presentation of heritage places. Many of the 
groups are characterised by their focus on a specific locale, associated with a range of interests and 
activities extending beyond cultural heritage. Indeed, a couple of groups we worked with can best be 
described as ‘communities of practice’; loose, emergent or transient groups, formed around particular 
kinds of activity and/or heritage places with little formal organisational structure.

In terms of size, the groups range from a handful of people to those with a sizeable membership, 
although the ACCORD team usually worked with 5–10 (self-selecting) participants from a given group. 
The groups are widely distributed across Scotland, from the Central Belt, to Kirkcubright in the south-
west, the Ardnamurchan peninsula in the West Highlands, Rhynie in the East, and the remote islands 
of the Uists and Bressay (see Figure 3). These offer radically different geographic contexts associated 
with correspondingly diverse landscapes and forms of heritage, including densely populated urban 
conurbations, rural/coastal towns and villages, and dispersed Highland and Island communities. There 
are also significant variations in socio-economic context, ranging from Castlemilk, one of Glasgow’s 
post-War social housing schemes, to the wealthy rural town of Kirkcudbright, to communities under-
going population decline in more remote regions. There are also some variations in age and gender, at 
least in terms of the individuals who participated in ACCORD. However, the most significant social 
distinction, for rural groups at least, is that between self-defining ‘incomers’ and ‘locals’; a widespread 
category distinction in rural Scotland (e.g. Macdonald 1997a; Nadel-Klein 1991).

For many of the groups, investigating, conserving and/or promoting heritage places is a means to 
establish connections to locality and make a place for themselves; as one participant put it, to ‘get in 
touch through the story’. This inclination is often particularly pronounced or explicit for those who see 
themselves, and/or are defined by others, as ‘incomers’. This also impacts on the kinds of monument 
people focus on. For instance, rural heritage groups with a significant proportion of ‘incomers’ often 
avoid the recent past, which is bound up in personal genealogies and oral histories, and focus on the 
distant past manifested in archaeological monuments to create a sense of connection for themselves.
Related processes are at work in contexts associated with a history of dislocation or displacement. 
For instance, the Scots-Americans involved in the Tarbet dig within the Loch Lomond and Trossachs 
National Park are seeking to re-connect with their clan heritage by actively investigating and record-
ing what they see as their Clan MacFarlane heritage. In a very different context, for members of 
Castlemilk’s ‘How Old Are Yew?’ group, investigating, recording and preserving what might be seen 
as the elite heritage of the former Castlemilk House offers a means to create a sense of belonging in 
one of Glasgow’s notorious post-war housing schemes.

Another important aspect of these place-making activities is the desire to counter decline and mar-
ginalisation. The Rhynie Woman group offers another example, seeing Rhynie as ‘a bit of a backwater’ 
and their work as a means of ‘putting Rhynie on the map’. Colintraive and Glendaruel History and 
Archaeology Group are also preoccupied with marginalisation seeing themselves as ‘a community at 
risk’ and heritage as a means of generating tourism, business and leisure; ‘making something that peo-
ple will want to come and see’. Indeed, countering ‘risk’ is an important stimulus to the place-making

activities of many of the community heritage groups involved in ACCORD, whether threats take the 
form of vandalism, coastal erosion, or straightforward neglect.

These on-going heritage practices and the relationships associated with them framed the co-design 
and co-production of 3D digital heritage visualisations during the ACCORD project. The interests, 
agendas and values of the groups concerned, informed the heritage places we recorded and modelled, 
creating visualisations of ‘places of significance’ as defined by the groups themselves. A wide range of 
monuments, buildings and objects were ultimately selected for recording and visualisation (see Table 
2 and Figure 4). Among them are prehistoric monuments (such as Lephinkill Chambered tomb and 
Grimsay Wheelhouse) and historic buildings (such as the excavated remains of a seventeenth/eight-
eenth century structure on Tarbet Isle, the ruined manse in the abandoned township of Cullingsburgh 
(Figure 4(a)), or the Monteath Mausoleum in Glasgow Necropolis). There are a number of early 
medieval sculptured stones (Figure 4(d)), and a significant number of later historic gravestones. Other 
memorials include the Jhone MacFarlan (sic) plaque in the wall of Luss Church (Figure 4(c)) and the 
WW1 War Memorial in Colintraive (also Figure 4(d)). Finally there is also a range of what can be 
classed as art, in the form of sculptures and rock art, ranging from prehistoric cup and ring marks, to 
the late twentieth century sculpture King of the Castle in Castlemilk, and the graffiti associated with 
the climbing routes at Dumbarton Rock.

Some of the heritage places that were visualised as part of the ACCORD project are associated with 
family history and genealogical connections, but more frequently they relate to less direct or specific 
notions of inheritance and cultural continuity. Many also have a symbolic or iconic role in terms of 
the distinctiveness of a place and the identity of those associated with it. For instance, for the Friends 
of Glasgow Necropolis, the cemetery is an important symbol of the city, intimately associated with its

‘illustrious’ Victorian history. In a very different context, members of the Access Archaeology Group 
see Grimsay Wheelhouse as an iconic monument, distinguishing the Uists from other islands in the 
Outer Hebridean archipelago, as well as the rest of Scotland. Dumbarton Rock, or ‘Dumby’, has an 
iconic role in Scottish climbing heritage, symbolic of a gritty urban scene (see Hale et al. 2017, 9, 
12). As a final contrasting example, Kenny Hunter’s King of the Castle Sculpture, created as part of a 
public art regeneration project in 1999, is symbolic of the resilience and spirit that characterise the 
Castlemilk community.

As we discuss in detail elsewhere, many of the social and communal values associated with these 
tangible heritage places ‘migrate’ to 3D visualisations in the context of co-production methodologies 
(Jeffrey et al. In Prep). The ACCORD project provides clear evidence that the digital models accrue 
similar values to originals, becoming imbued with symbolic associations relating to identity and place. 
At the same time, it shows that visualisation technologies can also enhance the understanding of the 
original monument or object e.g. RTI can reveal inscriptions or designs that are otherwise difficult 
or impossible to identify, and photogrammetry can facilitate new perspectives and viewpoints that 
change people’s understanding of the original historic forms. In a less direct sense 3D digital records 
have the potential to reinforce and enhance forms of symbolism and community identity associated 
with originals. Indeed, the act of digital recording in the context of community co-production extends 
relations with the original metaphorically and physically, through the forms of production involved. 
It requires an objectification of significance, alongside concentrated forms of engagement, which are 
experienced communally, and which add to the cultural biography of the original historic buildings, 
monuments and objects involved.

Thus, in the context of community co-production, 3D records and visualisations not only accrue 
value, they also enhance the values associated with the tangible heritage objects they represent, and 
in some cases even create new forms of value. But what of the ambivalent relationships between 3D 
digital representations and authenticity? How does community co-production impact on the authen-
ticity of 3D models and indeed their physical counterparts? In the next section we return to this issue.

The digital and the material: experiencing and negotiating authenticity in the 
ACCORD project
Preliminary responses from those involved in the ACCORD project appeared to uphold a strong dis-
tinction between digital representations and their tangible counterparts. People’s initial reactions to the 
digital models they had created often focused on their visual impression and aesthetics, especially their 
realism or hyper-realism: ‘it looks just like the real thing’, ‘it’s almost more real than the original’, and 
so forth. The apparent veracity or fidelity of the digital visualisations was central to these claims and a 
repeated focus of discussion, ostensibly vindicating prevailing academic concerns about the accuracy 
and objectivity of the digital surrogate. Furthermore, many focused on the photographic qualities 
of the models and their potential as forms of record for conservation and investigation. However, 
although these characteristics would appear to bring 3D models and visualisations closer to the realm 
of the authentic, in the sense of the real, the genuine and the truthful, ironically that was not the case. 
Indeed, explicit statements regarding the distinctiveness of the digital copy usually accompanied these 
discussions: ‘it’s not the same as the original though’; ‘it could never be a substitute for the original’.
In making distinctions between original and virtual objects participants would frequently high-
light characteristics of the former that are absent in the digital realm. The importance of tangibility 
and touch was often underlined, resonating with recent research on authenticity (e.g. Holtorf 2013; 
Jones 2010, 2016). As one participant put it, the original ‘makes you want to touch it’, whilst another 
emphasised that contact with the original offers a ‘physical connection back to the people who make 
it’, echoing Holtorf’s (2013, 433) arguments about one of the key characteristics of ‘pastness’. Other 
sensory qualities associated with the experience of tangible historic objects were also highlighted: 
their physical setting and wider landscape; associated sounds and smells; the weather and so forth. 
Such issues were rarely straightforward, often resulting in debate about the distinctions. For instance, 
one member of the Access Archaeology Group in the Uists pointed out that the 3D visualisation is 
‘still a representation …. It doesn’t have atmosphere, the landscape, the weather’. Another member 
of the group immediately countered this view, asserting that ‘it is a visualisation, but it is [also] a real 
site, it is the stone, it is the site’. This exchange was then followed by a passionate discussion about 
the importance of changing weather conditions and sounds, such as bird song, in the experience of 
historic objects, monuments and places.

The ethnographic material from the ACCORD project thus echoes recent studies that highlight 
the importance of sensory aspects of experience in the negotiation of authenticity. These aspects are 
clearly missing from the digital models and this constrains their aura and authenticity in part. However, 
complex relations are created between physical originals and digital models, which demonstrate that the 
latter are active agents in the negotiation of authenticity. Some ACCORD participants clearly felt that 
digital representations can take something away from their original counterparts. As one participant in 
the Kirkudbright group evocatively exclaimed, ‘it dilutes the original!’; seemingly echoing Benjamin’s 
point about the decay of aura. Yet, many participants highlighted the ways in which digital models offer 
new ways of seeing and experiencing. People talked of ‘seeing more’ or ‘seeing differently’. Moreover, 
for one of the climbers we worked with at Dumbarton Rock the 3D models of the boulders and rock 
faces allowed him ‘to experience the place differently’. Indeed despite the absence of materiality, the 
climbers’ response to the digital models was informed by their embodied practices, and the value of 
the models in part lay in the way they allowed them to think through the relation between their bodies 
and the surfaces of the rock in new ways (Figure 5) (for further discussion see Hale et al. 2017, 10–11).

 S. JONES ET AL.

The ability to manipulate photogrammetric models and hence gain access to new perspectives on 
their physical counterparts was also important to such claims about new ways of seeing and experi-
encing (and see Cameron 2007, 66). More commonly, these were prompted by the revelations of RTI, 
illuminating previously illegible inscriptions and other marks, such as the cup and ring marks recorded 
using this technique with the Glendaruel and Colintraive group (Figure 1(d)). As one participant 
exclaimed upon seeing the results of the RTI, ‘I couldn’t see why it was exciting and important before 
[…] now I see why’. In this way, as Latour and Lowe (2011, 4) argue, ‘facsimiles, and especially those 
relying on complex (digital) techniques, are the most fruitful way to explore the original and even to 
help re-define what originality actually is’. Yet it is not just down to their ability to register and reveal 
aspects of a thing that are invisible to the human eye. The digital object is also associated with a magical 
quality that animates the original. As one participant in the ACCORD project remarked, the digital 
visualisation ‘brings it [the original] to life’. It can be argued that this also relates to the experience 
of authenticity; the process of digital recording and representation somehow brings those involved 
closer to the unique biography of the original, through forms of studied attention that highlight the 
marks of its production and the patina of age, even if in the form of a representation (Cameron 2007, 
63; Garstki 2016, 5–6).

Importantly, the act of participating in the production of 3D visualisations was a significant aspect 
of people’s responses to the models, contributing to a sense of authenticity. The significance of ‘being 
there’ was summed up particularly succinctly by one participant in the Uist group who simply stated, 
‘it’s authentic because we made it’. For some, the authenticity of the model was also derived from pre-ex-
isting forms of attachment and identity associated with the site they were recording and modelling.

As discussed in the previous section, these visualisation practices were undertaken in landscapes that 
are rich in significance and the focus of existing heritage practices, and this in turn clearly contrib-
uted not just to the value of the resulting models, but also their authenticity. Thus, in the context of 
co-production, the productive nature of 3D models, and the significance of who creates them with 
what intention, is brought into sharp focus, creating forms of authority and aura.

At the same time, the ACCORD project shows that, in the context of community co-production at 
least, 3D heritage visualisations can create, extend and reinforce networks of relations between people, 
monuments and places. In a number of cases, visualisation served to articulate and authorise relations 
between objects and places. For instance in recording and modelling a nineteenth-century garden 
statue of Falstaff (Figure 6(b)), which is now located in Calderwood Park, the Castlemilk group were 
driven by a concern to reconnect the statue with its original location in the grounds of the former 
Castlemilk House. Their selection of the statue in the context of co-design was framed by previous 
research on the house and its grounds, in particular an historic postcard showing Falstaff standing in 
the gardens. Talk of requesting his physical return to Castlemilk, was transposed into the possibility 
of a metaphorical re-appropriation through recording and modelling.

Thus 3D visualisation can provide a mechanism for negotiating relations of attachment and belong-
ing, as discussed by Brown (2007) in relation to Maori objects in museums. At the same time, whilst 
the Castlemilk example apparently centres on the relationship between objects and places, it also 
needs to be understood in terms of relationships between people and place set against the experience 
of postwar urban renewal and displacement. In coupling Falstaff – a nineteenth-century monument 
that has been displaced – with the ‘King of the Castle’ sculpture (1999) – a monument resulting

from a public art project celebrating Castlemilk’s modern housing estate – the Castlemilk group were 
actively engaged in reinforcing their own connections to place (Figure 6). The ‘wee rascal’, as ‘King 
of the Castle’ is affectionately known locally, is an icon of Castlemilk, ‘everyone knows it!’ As one 
person explained, he ‘tells of the regeneration story’, which is so important in terms of transforming 
Castlemilk from an economically deprived housing scheme on the outskirts of a Glasgow into a place 
of significance (Figure 6(c)).

There are many other examples from the ACCORD project that demonstrate how 3D recording and 
modelling became caught up in the negotiation of authentic relationships between people and places, 
past and present. One of the most obvious is the way in which the Scots-Americans who participated 
in the Tarbet Isle excavations saw 3D visualisation as a means to authenticate their own relationships 
to the MacFarlane Clan. 3D visualisation and printing focused on the wall footings uncovered by the 
excavations on Tarbet Isle (James 2015), as well as the seventeenth-century plaque in memory of Jhone 
MacFarlan (sic) located in the wall of Luss Church (also known as St Kessog’s Church) (Figure 4(c)). 
For the two MacFarlane participants (who also funded the excavations on Tarbet Isle) creating virtual 
models captured the act of ‘being there’, in the heart of what they see as MacFarlane country, even 
though the status of the Tarbet Isle structure as a Clan MacFarlane stronghold remained unsubstanti-
ated. It was also felt that the virtual models would enable others in the Clan MacFarlane Society back 
home in the U.S.A. to connect to their ancestors remotely. For one participant 3D printing became 
key to this process, as he explained in a subsequent blog article in language saturated with allusions 
to authenticity:

Photogrammetry combined with 3D printing is an incredibly special technology which can be used to perma-
nently capture and preserve the real world […] 3D printing has allowed me to bring some of that homeland and 
history back with me. This makes it easier for people to discover, understand, and fall in love with their heritage. 
They can now hold in their hand a scaled reproduction of a building or some other artefact. (McFarland cited 
in Krassenstein 2014)
Whilst such explicit statements are music to the ears of commercial ventures like 3DPrint.com and 
others, the ACCORD project also reveals more complex and subtle negotiations at stake in 3D record-
ing. For instance, in the case of other groups the creation of 3D records and visualisations provided 
a means for self-defined ‘incomers’, with no prior connections to the rural communities they have 
settled in, to create a sense of connection for themselves. Doing photogrammetry and RTI required 
them to devote time and studied attention to a specific place, but it also served to incorporate them 
into the biography of that place through their authorship of a virtual model. Thus, in the context of 
co-production the practices involved in the use of 3D technologies create networks of relationships 
between historic objects, people and places that become part of the biography of the virtual object 
and mediate the experience of authenticity for all involved.

Digital objects thus become caught up in the cultural politics of authentication. The selection of an 
object, building or monument for recording and modelling creates meaning and value and extends 
networks of relationships across time and place. For instance, members of the Kirkcudbright History 
Society selected various headstones in the Kirkcudbright Kirkyard as a means to show how the cem-
etery, which was subject to vandalism in 2010, is a cherished part of the community (Figure 1(b)). 
The decision of the Colintraive and Glendaruel group to model a neglected and forgotten memorial 
to two brothers who died at Gallipoli was an act of reinstating them in local social memory at a time 
of wider commemoration of WW1 (Figure 4(d)). For one member of the ACCORD group, who had 
just returned from 20 years in Australia, it also became a personal project of reinstatement allowing 
him to make a meaningful connection between Australia and his new home through his subsequent 
investigation of the lives of the brothers and their deaths at Gallipoli.

Three final brief examples demonstrate the power of visualisation to endorse (or not) forms of her-
itage that have an ambivalent status in terms of authenticity. As discussed above, for the climbers we 
worked with at Dumbarton Rock, visualising the climbing boulders and rock faces provided a means 
of incorporating ‘Dumby’s’ place in Scottish climbing heritage into the wider discourses of authenticity 
surrounding the monument, including controversially the graffiti that adorns the rock surfaces (Figure 

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HERITAGE STUDIES  

  349

5(c)). In contrast, with Grimsay Wheelhouse, members of the Uists’ Access Archaeology Group rec-
ognised that in the eyes of archaeologists and heritage professionals, the 3D model might authenticate 
what is regarded as a controversial reconstruction based on the excavations of a lone local amateur. 
Nevertheless, this awareness did not ultimately undercut their desire to model the wheelhouse, which 
is an iconic type of monument distinguishing the Uists from other places. Perhaps the most decisive 
example of the authenticating role of 3D recording is found in the case of the Bressay Stone, the original 
of which is now part of National Museums Scotland, located in Edinburgh. In this case, the idea of 
recording and modelling a physical replica that stands in its place on Bressay was dismissed, because 
it was felt that visualisation would lend it undue value and authenticity and reinforce the rights of the 
museum in regard to the original.

It would thus appear that digital visualisations have a role in mediating the experience of authenticity 
for those involved in their production. Whilst digital models may lack the visceral thrill of being in 
the presence of the original, they can create new sets of relations with their physical counterparts that 
gives the models a magical, alluring quality, and this in turn suggests a partial if limited migration of 
aura. 3D models also acquire new forms of authenticity, because recording and modelling is a creative 
process, and thus the product acquires a form of aura in relation to the networks of relations involved 
in their production. Yet above all, it is clear that 3D visualisations do important authenticating work, 
becoming active agents in the negotiation of relations between people, places and things, as well as 
the cultural politics that inform those relations.

Conclusion
The results of the ACCORD project make a significant contribution to theories of authenticity and 
have important implications for heritage visualisation practice. Much of the theoretical debate cur-
rently focuses on the accuracy of the data and/or the realism of the resulting 3D visualisations. Flynn 
(2007, 350) points out that ‘in virtual heritage, an algorithmically accurate large-scale 3D model of a 
cathedral or castle is taken as the hallmark of authenticity’. A long-standing ‘technological fetishism’ 
(Huggett 2004) reigns where claims to objectivity and authenticity are removed from the producer 
and located with the technology itself (Garstki 2016, 15). Furthermore, notions of ‘digital surrogacy’ 
are commonplace (Garstki 2016; Rabinowitz 2015), but because of their potential for successful imi-
tation digital historic objects are also conceived as a source of threat to the authentic original object 
(Cameron 2007, 51). The London Charter for the Computer-based Visualisation of Cultural Heritage 
thus stresses the need to distinguish between ‘fact and fiction’ in heritage visualisation, to make visible 
‘the limitations of knowledge’ (Denard 2012). Furthermore, in museums and heritage organisations, 
much work is devoted to preserving the authority and authenticity of the original over the digital 
(Cameron 2007, 52). Nevertheless, all too often the productive or creative nature of 3D visualisation, 
embodied in acts of selection, manipulation and interpretation, remains obscure in the presentation 
of the final models (Cameron 2007, 56; also Garstki ; Rabinowitz 2015).

The ACCORD project takes questions of authenticity and 3D visualisation into a new arena – that 
of community heritage practice. Using rapid ethnographic approaches, combined with co-produc-
tion of 3D models of historic objects, buildings and monuments, we have explored when and how 
digital visualisations acquire authenticity. There is evidence for some ‘migration of aura’ (Latour and 
Lowe 2011, 4) in that the digital ‘copy’ becomes part of the trajectory of original and its continually 
re-written biography. The meanings, values, attachments and agendas that informed the selection and 
creation of visualisations during the ACCORD project ensured a partial, if at times limited, migration 
of authenticity. Yet we also agree with Cameron (2007, 67) that 3D visualisation is a creative work in its 
own right and thus ‘the digital acts as testimony to its own history and origin, and hence authenticity’. 
Community co-production of 3D digital models, in which their history and provenance is explicitly 
tied to those involved in their design and creation, shows very clearly that they can acquire aura and 
authenticity independently. In this way digital visualisations embody networks of relations between 
objects, people and places, as Deger (2016, 128) has argued for ‘thick photography’. These networks 

350

in turn are central to the production and negotiation of authenticity, whether in relation to material 
or digital objects (Jones 2010; Jones and Yarrow 2013; Macdonald 2013).

The key point here is that a pre-occupation with the virtual object – and the binary question of whether 
it is or is not authentic – obscures the wider work that digital objects do. There is strong evidence from 
the ACCORD project that the creation of digital models can actively mediate the authenticity and 
status of their original counterparts. Visualisation is also incontrovertibly caught up in the work of 
remediation that goes on around heritage places, in particular the wider cultural politics of ownership, 
attachment, place-making and regeneration. Thus seeing the authenticity of digital 3D models simply 
as a facet of their accuracy, objectivity or realism is a misplaced venture. Instead, we echo Gilling’s 
(2005) argument that it would be far more profitable to see it as a property of the relationships between 
people and their world.

These conclusions have a number of implications for the use of heritage visualisation in practice. 
In providing benchmark standards, The London Charter (2009) stresses that ‘sufficient information 
should be documented and disseminated to allow computer-based visualisation methods and outcomes 
to be understood and evaluated’. This includes documenting knowledge-claims, research sources, 
methods, formats and standards. However, there needs to be more attention to who was involved in the 
production of specific visualisations, their relationships to the original historic objects involved, and 
the social, economic and political conditions under which visualisations are produced. Furthermore, 
whilst access and communication are given considerable weight in the Charter, the emphasis is very 
much on stewardship and the dissemination of expert knowledge to public audiences. In the current 
version, there is no mention of public participatory methods, nor the potential value of co-design 
and co-production.

Based on the results of the ACCORD project we argue that the design and production of herit-
age visualisations should include a consideration of the wider cultural politics and social relations 
surrounding the original historic objects, as well as the production of digital records and models 
(see Brown 2007; Deger 2016). Communities of interest and practice should be consulted and where 
possible included in co-design and co-production of visualisations alongside academics, heritage 
professionals,  designers  and  digital  technologists.  Furthermore,  documentation  should  include  a 
record of these relationships, and associated interests and practices, making these accessible to those 
who view heritage visualisations. For examples of how this can be achieved see the statements of 
significance archived with the ACCORD data (Jeffrey et al. 2017). These proposals shift the emphasis 
from product to process, but they would also enhance the significance of the products. The meaning, 
value and authenticity of digital heritage visualisations would be enhanced and their relationship to 
the unfolding biographies of their historic counterparts sustained. Importantly, such developments 
should also facilitate a richer dialogue about what is at stake in the visualisations and experiences we 
produce about the past.
