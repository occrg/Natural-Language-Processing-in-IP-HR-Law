goddess into a symbol of classical education

This paper discusses how ties with society are accumulated and interpreted as
the ‘culture’ of an artefact. Following the reinterpretation of a painted statue into
a white museum artefact, I argue that the rules we have to follow in approach-
ing an artefact create a series of unrelated socio-cultural connotations which
shape our perception of the object. The culture of the artefact is therefore largely
the culture of the context through which it is presented. Hence, by distancing an
artefact from an established context you also distance it from the networks that
make up a large part of its cultural value. To discuss this process I draw on the
works of Michael Callon and Bruno Latour, describing the presentation as a
‘translation’ – a process where the artefact is reinterpreted from one state into
another. As a method to describe values sprung from the presentation of the
artefact, I propose, and exemplify, a vocabulary of limitations for mapping the
ties between society and artefact in different contexts. This vocabulary – devel-
oped for this article – helps us identify deeper connections between artefact,
context and society by focusing on how interaction has been shaped around the
artefact.

Prologue
What is so new about the New Acropolis Museum? The visitor ponders this ques-
tion. Perhaps it is the architecture by Tschumi? The large panoramic windows offer
a magniﬁcent view of both the Acropolis and the protruding Parthenon, as well as
the modern city of Athens. The slopes of the Sacred Rock and the excavation of an
early Christian housing complex directly below the museum are exposed through
the glass ﬂoor of the First Gallery, creating a powerful visual connection between
the displayed ﬁnds and the brownish cellar ruins. As the visitor enters the minimal-
istically furnished gallery, she is struck by how the artefacts seem to ﬂoat above the
very ground from which they were excavated. Hesitantly she tries the ﬂoor. The
stairs at the end of the open space lead up to a piecemeal reconstructed pediment
triangle of a temple, leaving the visitor suspended on the glass ﬂoor between an
ancient cellar and an ancient roof. Climbing the stairs, moving from gallery to
gallery, moreover, she climbs a spatial representation of the Acropolis, culminating

in the politically charged Parthenon sculptures. The visitor also moves in time, from
ﬁnds of the earliest periods through Classical Antiquity, and then downwards with
the slow decline of the Roman period.

The visitor, however, senses a troubling disconnection, of which she cannot
explain the source. Perhaps it is how the cliff of the Acropolis and the ruins below
the First Gallery are but stripped remains of the context they were built in? Perhaps
the way in which the ﬁnds in the galleries hang frozen in time, conserved, on their
pedestals? Or are they really frozen? Though the architecture of the New Acropolis
Museum (NAM) seems to herald a commitment to communicating context, the pre-
sentation of the artefacts remains conservative. Is this yet another museum whose
greatest conserved object is the museum ideology itself? Walking through the gal-
leries, the visitor notices a father pointing out to his ﬁve-year-old son a bleached
classical marble statue while he in an excited but hushed voice sums it up to the
boy: ‘This is culture!’ The visitor smiles to herself, recognising the complexity of
that remark. Is this culture? And in case it is: what is culture?

No, the ﬁnds are not frozen, she realises, and neither are they culture. The mar-
ble statue has, during its lifetime, been accessed by a series of groups in a series
of situations, which have all added their own contexts and interpretations to it.
From its point of origin, when it was newly painted in bright colours and clothed,
until its present state, where it stands white, naked and neutral under a spotlight,
the statue has undergone a series of translations. It is but an artefact of the cultures
which have negotiated access to it: the people who used the dressing ritual as an
excuse to feast and connect; the private collectors who used the artefact as a mani-
festation of their power and wealth; the renaissance artists who used it as a model
when trying to emulate – and exceed – the arts of antiquity; the public museums
who use it to attract visitors; the movie directors who use its white likeness as a
visual signiﬁer of culture, power, wealth and religion. The original colours and
attributes of the artefact have faded and become displaced by new meanings and
contexts, all of which have created ripples and networks in the surrounding
societies.

The visitor shakes her head at the enormity of it all. The classical statue has
moved from the role of supporting actor in one context – in an active cult – to that
of supporting actor in another context – in a historical museum – but it has not
been a simple translation. Although the statue seems unchanged in appearance,
there is no direct translation between these two states. When the museum visitor
meets the classical statue, this is no longer simply a statue, if it ever was, but an
artefact with a network of connotations – assumptions and values which shape our
perception – that have been attached to it through all the intervening translations.
The visitor sighs as she looks at the classical statue in front of her. Even though it
is of the same stone, shape and size as it was more than 25 centuries ago, it is not
the same statue.

Introduction
The obsession of the age is for the original artefact and its perceived superiority
over the facsimile (Latour and Lowe 2011). This obsession is inspired by a ten-
dency when approaching an artefact to view it as a reservoir of meaning – a direct
link to the age of its creation – rather than as an object whose value has been accu-
mulated by the different contexts it has existed in (see Brattli 2009, p. 31). The

20

J. Westin

classical statue is perceived as ‘culture’ even though it is primarily a quasi-object
that has existed in many networks (Serres 1995, p. 91, see also Bingham 1996).
These networks are attached to the statue in the form of connotations. Latour sees
the quasi-object and its attachments as the real centre of the social world (2005, p.
238), and Lévy writes that ‘one could recount the history of humanity from its very
beginnings as a succession of emerging objects, each of them inseparably linked to
a particular form of social dynamics’ (1996). The question persists, however: how
have these socio-cultural networks been formed and stabilised, and later on trans-
lated into new networks, that make them recognisable as ‘culture’? A translation
occurs when something is explained, arranged or presented to accommodate the
need of a certain group (Callon 1986). This is not a clean and one-sided operation
but a negotiation process where the identity and strength of the various actors
involved are tested.

Following the argument

in this paper, knowledge of the process behind the
accumulation of cultural value of an artefact is important when considering how to
best exhibit it, since the presentation represents a large part of those values. The
question of values mediated by presentation becomes even more acute when one
considers the fact that our cultural heritage is experienced, more and more, through
digitised representations in digital displays, interactive computer visualisations or
museum databases (see Cameron 2007, Flynn 2007, Frischer et al. 2002, Kalay
2008, Roussou 2008, Westin and Eriksson 2010). In this realm, the artefact, sepa-
rated from the limitations brought on by its physicality, can be quickly brought
between different presentation contexts. For all
its convenience, however, few
would argue that nothing has been lost in the translation into a digital format (see
Silberman 2008 on the importance of ‘essence’ in digital heritage). When digitised,
the artefact is detached from the context to which it was bound by its physical con-
text, something that demanded certain networks in operation with established ties
with society. The translation into a digital format, however, is only the latest in a
long series of transformations in the career of the artefact. Therefore, the aim of this
paper is to discuss how these ties with society are treated when an artefact under-
goes a translation to a new context, and to present this reasoning as an aid relevant
to further research in the ﬁeld of cultural heritage studies. To achieve this I have
developed a vocabulary of limitations to facilitate the communication of an artefact
in translation. A vocabulary is a single repertoire to describe an action that creates a
generalised symmetry and enhances the understanding of a phenomenon. By limita-
tion I mean anything that hinders any conceivable action or free movement. For
instance, one limitation of a printed page is that you cannot correct any mistakes.
The glass panes in front of the Mona Lisa, or the red cords separating you from an
artefact, limit your possible movements and your senses to that of sight. The objec-
tive is to show how this vocabulary can be adapted to the analytical framework of
the sociology of translation and actor-network theory (Callon 1986, Latour 1994,
2005) to identify the socio-cultural connections of a phenomenon in a translation
context.

The tendency of historical museums to focus their attention on ‘the artefact’
makes them well suited for studies using actor-network theory (ANT), as exempli-
ﬁed by Bennett (2009, 2010), Brattli (2009), Grahn (1997, 2005), Guggenheim
(2009), Hennion (1996), and Hetherington (1999, 2002). In their research,
they
have effectively shown how the movement of an object is slowed down by the
museum. Controversies are resolved by uniforming how the object is presented,



21

something that is achieved through a series of actants. These actants do not include
humans alone, but also signs, displays, climate and light control, established prac-
tices, and architecture. The objects and the site, the non-human actants, are here
allowed to speak for themselves, on equal footing with the social world. Whether
sentient or not, an actant makes itself known by how it guides action or reinforces
a reasoning. Just as human actants can be enrolled to a cause, so can non-human
actants.

It is not within the scope of this paper to give a comprehensive overview of the
emergence of the modern museum (for this, see Bennett 1995, Hooper-Greenhill
1992), but rather to explore the possibilities of studying the presentation of an arte-
fact through the way the context limits our interaction with it. By focusing on the
limitations, we ﬁnd an aspect of the artefact that is either abandoned or, if lucky, in
a position to shape other actants around it and create ties with society. This gives
us a tool to discuss these ties – often in the form of connotations – as enrolled
actants of the artefact when describing cultural shifts, and also to understand one
aspect of the perception of ‘culture’. As Lemonnier writes in the introduction to
Technological Choices: ‘as soon as one looks at the way things are made (or used),
rather than at their external appearance, the sociology of artefacts opens up along
new and fertile lines’ (1993, p. 11).

This study addresses the contemporary theory of conservation (see Guillemard
1992, Muñoz Viñas 2005, Taylor 1978) in recognising that an artefact or phenome-
non possesses an accumulation of different, often subjective, values that all need to
be considered in any conservation effort, but has the more speciﬁc goal of offering
a theoretical approach to what I consider a key question in the digitisation and com-
munication of cultural heritage: How do you map and describe the connotative val-
ues of an artefact?

Describing an artefact
ANT deﬁnes a quasi-object as a hybrid between concepts and materiality which is
increasingly punctualised – seen as a single object – while passed through one or
more networks. Though in itself a structure made up of many practices and pro-
cesses, the artefact can be externally described as a quasi-object which, over the
years, has been accessed and reiﬁed by a succession of interests. The different ways
in which these interests access the artefact anchor it to society. Following the classi-
cal statue through time, it started out anchored through rituals, religion and busi-
ness; the collectors anchored it through power and wealth; the renaissance artists
anchored it through technique and beauty; the museums anchored it through age
and education. Consequently, the artefact – though largely unchanged in appearance
– has been approached in many different ways that have all shaped the mode in
which it has been perceived. It could therefore be described as a quasi-object that
has existed in many different formats. A format is both a physical description, such
as height and width, but also, and more appropriately in this example, a set of rules
describing how something is presented.

Just as the same piece of poetry could be translated into a series of formats with
their own subset of connotations – whispered by one person to another, as text in a
book, recited by the poet on an audio recording or performed as a punk song – the
artefact has undergone translations to mean different things and to be accessible to
different people. The term for original art that can be accessed through different

22

formats is content. In describing the artefact as a content that has existed in many
different formats we can gain an understanding of the artefact’s accumulation of
value by analysing how society is shaped by such a format. Using the vocabulary
of limitations, I will follow a network of non-human actants at the NAM to show
how the format anchors an artefact
to society through networks that create
socio-cultural connections. These connections are often carried over as connotations
to the next format shaping our perception of the artefact, but can just as easily be
severed. Barbanera writes that ‘archaeological museums are often the outcome of a
tentative recontextualisation of objects from the past which have been ﬁltered
through numerous experiences’ (2008, p. 175). By focusing on limitations at
various steps in the career of an artefact, we have a tool that helps us both to
describe earlier negotiations and to understand how our current perception of it is
formed – how the painted statue of a goddess was translated into a symbol of clas-
sical education and culture. The vocabulary of limitations is here used to discern
deeper levels of connotative values when describing this translation.

It is important to consider underlying values when approaching the problems of
representation – through both digital and analogue means – since representations
translate an idea into form and, by extension, shape how reality is perceived. A rep-
resentation is neither a simulacrum nor a complete version of reality, only ‘a repre-
sentation of some “relevant characteristics”’ (Arnold 2008, p. 159). To avoid
introducing anachronistic values into this reality, a historical representation must
therefore take into account how our deeper perceptions of the artefact have changed
because of its many translations. If translated in a way that adheres to the values
invested in it by the stakeholders, a representation can be perceived as – and per-
haps be – more authentic than an original (Latour and Lowe 2011). Likewise, an
original – or a copy for that matter – out of context can lose much of its value and
sense of culture connected to place, and thus ‘become generic rather than unique’
(Malpas 2008, p. 22). This approach to the much-debated concept of authenticity is
that of a performative authenticity, an authenticity that bridges the authenticity of
the original and the authenticity of identity, feeling and place (Knudsen and Waade
2010, p. 1). In this view, which differs from early notions of authenticity such as
Benjamin (1936) and Riegl (1903/1982), authenticity is both constructed and felt.1
An artefact can be authenticated by a series of actants working together, all integral
in the professional construction of a museal fact (Grahn 1997), but even so be an
original which inspires an emotional connection.2 The way this is experienced is
often referred to as an indexical authenticity (Grayson and Martinec 2004, Ray
et al. 2006, p. 442). A phenomenon or artefact is perceived to be ‘an original’ or
‘genuine’ as an outcome of the relation between place and performing body
(Knudsen and Waade 2010, p. 8). The spaces of imagery, memory, experience and
materiality are not laterally separated, but instead superimposed in a relation that
creates what is ‘authentic’ and ‘of cultural value’. As content is translated into a
new format,
the superimposed layers need to be
renegotiated.

relations of

the internal

Translations between formats often correlate with translations between technolo-
gies. It has been much discussed whether technological shifts should be seen as
choices based more on social strategies and cultural values rather than effective
beneﬁts of the technology itself (Guille-Escuret 1993, Latour 1993, Lemonnier
1993, Mahias 1993, van der Leeuw 1993), along with technology as something that
guides our choices (Ivarsson 2010, Latour 1992, Säljö 1998, Westin 2009, 2011).

A technological feature, Lemonnier writes, ‘has to ﬁt physically with already exist-
ing practices’ (1993, p. 13); to be accepted, it must show consistency with already
existing representations of technology. The focus, however, of the above-mentioned
authors has been on describing the choices of technology and how these choices
ﬁnd their arguments in social and cultural coherence, while this paper, viewing the
problem from the perspective of heritage studies, tries to map out a distinct vocabu-
lary in identifying socio-cultural connections as actants that are translated or lost
when an artefact is brought into a new context. Owing a lot to earlier research, this
study can be viewed as a continuation and an attempt to put it in a context of con-
servation, where the vocabulary of limitations is one tool to describe how deeper
cultural values evolve from a format. However, the interplay between format and
content – where the content is treated as a quasi-object which the format anchors to
society, in the process creating socio-cultural connections – is a distinct position of
this paper.

Limitations
When content is mediated through a format, it is shaped by the borders of that for-
mat through a negotiation concerning how the content is best communicated. This
negotiation includes both human and non-human actants that discipline the content
to emphasise certain aspects while suppressing others. As the content is later re-
mediated through subsequent formats, additional processes of translation take place.
All translations are both transformations and interpretations, by virtue of existing in
a network of reliances consisting of a variety of actants. This network does not ﬂow
in one direction but operates through negotiations that make every actant reliant on
the other actants. Either directly or indirectly, an idea cannot be expressed and exe-
cuted without being formulated in such a way that the other actants accept it. As
stated earlier, the formats in the career of our classical statue are all synonymous
with interaction – how the statue is presented and exhibited.

By describing an exhibition as a network of actants – and making no difference
whether they are human or non-human – these reliances become apparent. As
Guggenheim points out, the museum stabilises its artefacts by isolating them from
unwanted networks (2009, p. 45). Once the object has reached the museum, it is
brought into a network whose aim is to slow it down and stabilise both its physical
features and its history. This is achieved by climate and light control, thorough doc-
umentation practices, rigid security and professional presentation (see Bennett 2010,
p. 194). Hetherington writes that ‘what we see within a museum is performed by a
material semiotics that constitutes it as a scopic space. How objects are placed; how
they are ordered and classiﬁed help perform what we see’ (2002, p. 194). These
actions by the actants of the museum network can be read as limitations put on the
interaction between artefact and society, but also as the glue that connects the arte-
fact to society. They create the museum artefact. A limitation that deﬁnes a format
should not be seen as negative, but as a deﬁnition of the borders of a format within
which the content is moulded. When these borders are strong, they move beyond
the physical into society. The limitations of the format – the rules our interaction
with the artefact relentlessly have to adhere to – anchor it to society. ‘People per-
form objects, but especially buildings, by moving through and around them; but
these objects also perform people by constraining their movements and by suggest-
ing particular encounters between them and others’
(Pels, Hetherington, and

24

J. Westin

Vandenberghe 2002, p. 13). It is through these connections with a society that we
can trace an artefact’s socio-cultural values. The broader set of connotations
attached to those limitations must therefore be accounted for in describing a transla-
tion. Turning to a translation in process, this is exempliﬁed by how the NAM
shapes the contact between the classical statue and the visitor.

Revisiting the museum actants
As the museum visitor enters the First Gallery of the NAM – a large space with a
reinforced glass ﬂoor leading to a broad staircase at the other end of the room, with
displays lining the left wall – she is not guided by humans, but by architecture,
signs, lights and materials. She is led through the building by these non-human
actants. These are all including the visitor to perform in a scopic regime consisting
not just of backdrops and signs, but also the way in which they encourage her to
walk and pause (Hetherington 2002, p. 187). Just as the curator is dependent on the
visitor’s acceptance, the visitor is dependent on the museum to tell her what is of
importance. This is a job delegated to light, pedestals, space and placement. In the
First Gallery, the curator depends on the glass ﬂoor and signs to inform the visitor
about the context of the ﬁnds on display. The glass ﬂoor exhibits the very slopes
from which the artefacts have been excavated. The pedestals, glass and lights in
their turn depend on the curator and visitor to recognise them as visual signiﬁers
for what is important. Hence, an exhibition relies as much on the actants that build
it as the actants it is built for and the actants that make it work. Any actant in this
network might
construction fails, prompting a
re-negotiation and a detour to another actant (Latour 1994, p. 32). Perhaps the
pedestal- and light-actants fail to inform the visitor-actant that she cannot touch an
object and therefore need the help of additional actants like a sign and an encircling
cord? Perhaps the curator-actant fails to win the visitor-actant’s acceptance and
therefore has to present things in a new way?

and then the whole

fail,

Approaching the classical statue, the visitor slows down her movement. The
museum context – this latest format in the life of the classical statue – has taught
us what is important and of ‘cultural value’ through such actants as lights, glass dis-
plays, guards, red cords, and signs that inform us that it is forbidden to take photos.
We are led to and approach the statue in a certain way because of these actants and
the way they limit our interaction with it. A heavily guarded Corinthian capital on
a pedestal with a spotlight pointed at it is an important object of cultural value and
something the visitor would never touch, while, to the same visitor, a similar Corin-
thian capital in the park outside might be a funny-looking bench she would gladly
make use of to rest her legs for a while.

The above-mentioned actants have all limited our interaction with the museum
artefact on the pedestal. They have slowed the object down and established it as a
museal fact by removing all controversies and allowing the museum to step forth as
an authoritative interpreter of the artefact. Outside the museum, the controversies
are still raging. Unhindered by the enforced limitations of the museum network, our
free interaction with the artefact in the park reduces it to its physical form, free
from established authoritative interpretations. It stays an unconnected object and is
not at risk of being mistaken for ‘culture’ or museal fact. Individuals may recognise
it as a Corinthian capital of the second century, and may even be appalled by how
it is used by other visitors of the park. A temporary network between artefact and



25

informed individuals is established and kept alive by the individuals’ presence.
These individuals are however a minority. Without
the ability to delegate their
knowledge to non-human actants that could uphold this information, the ‘culture’
fades from the Corinthian capital once the informed individual has left the scene
(see Latour 1994, p. 37). The artefact is once again content you can touch and
interact with, the museum format forgotten.

Contrast this with the museum. The white classical statue is exhibited indoors,
where the environment can be adjusted to suit the artefact. Tschumi, the architect,
has deployed a highly controlled micro-environment all through the building. The
temperature is at an even level and the moisture in the air is kept from extreme
deviations, in order not to cause movements within the stone pores of the classical
statue. Natural light is used to a great extent, ﬁltered through two layers of glazing
that temper the sunlight and protect the artefacts. This minimises the dependence on
spotlights, actants important for many museums. The statue is raised on a two-
section pedestal. The lower section protrudes half a meter, as if to say to the visitor
‘this is my personal space, do not cross it’. The upper section adds height to the
artefact, forcing the visitor to regard it from below. Guards are evenly spaced out
across the galleries. They keep an eye on the visitors and interfere if anyone moves
too close to an artefact or tries to ignore the signs and take a photo. All these
actants, working together in making up the museum format, communicate an aura
of authenticity that causes the reaction: ‘This is culture’.

The connected socio-cultural expressions are attributed to the product, the arte-
fact, which therefore becomes ‘culture’ in combination with the connotations of the
format it is presented through. If the statue is placed in a historical reconstruction,
be it a movie scene or an interactive display, it is not stripped clean of those socio-
cultural connections; they follow the artefact like a set of rules for how to interpret
it and its surroundings. However, the connotations these rules give rise to might be
highly anachronistic, since they have their origin in a network established perhaps
thousand of years after the reconstructed context. Thus, we are often distressed
when we read about systematic destruction of buildings and statues during antiquity,
since we are conditioned by the museum networks to see them as great works of
art, historical documentation and ‘culture’ that should be handled with care, not as
the tools of politics and oppression through which they were sometimes anchored
to their society.

If some enterprising curator would put the artefact in a life-sized diorama as a
scenic context for the classical statue – complete with ﬂower offerings, smoke,
incense and restored colours – it would most certainly inspire a strong reaction from
the visitor, but would she point at it and call it ‘culture’? The artefact would not be
less authentic – some would argue that it would be more authentic – but it would
be perceived to have abandoned some of its authenticity (see Alsayyad 2008,
Malpas 2008). Muñoz Viñas problematises this by pointing out that if an object has
a true – or authentic – state, it directly implies that ‘the object can exist in a differ-
ent (a non-true, i.e. false) state or condition’ which has to be eliminated in order to
reveal the truth, a conclusion he ﬁnds unsatisfying (2005, p. 92ff.). The idea of
authenticity is often formed through collective memory – a common frame of refer-
ence – and does not need to correlate to an absolute truth, but rather a perceived
truth that
is part of this memory. A phenomenon or format may therefore be
perceived as more authentic than another based on age or broad acceptance by
society, thus amounting to a ‘preferred state’ rather than an ‘authentic state’.

26

Therefore, by reverting to an earlier format – that of an active cult object with
less-restrictive rules of interaction and in full colour – the classical statue loses
much of its perceived authenticity and ‘cultural’ value, since it is now in opposition
to the later format through which it has been anchored to society. The superimposed
layers making up ‘authenticity’ and ‘culture’ have gotten out of sync. The ensuing
controversy makes it impossible for the artefact to remain a museal fact until the
drama has died down and the format has been settled.

Mediations
The classical statue has become ‘culture’ by the social ties it has enrolled as a
consequence of the various formats in which it has existed. But how has it
moved between these contexts? Considering the format – the rules that tells us
how we may access content – as a generator of culture, we must ﬁrst assert its
relations to the act of mediation and see how artefact and context together carry
the deeper socio-cultural connotations of an artefact
is
important to remember that it is the limitations of the formats we are following
when describing the classical statue’s accumulation of ‘culture’, not
the statue
itself. The classical statue’s accumulation of the ‘culture’ with which it is now
packaged has been a slow process. All
translations have been accompanied by
negotiations concerning how to best exhibit
it, ensuing controversies and re-
negotiations.

through a translation. It

Moving from being an active cult-object into an art-object and from there into a
museum artefact, it is not hard to imagine some of the controversies. Consider three
of the formats in which the artefact has existed – cult format, collector format and
museum format – and in what ways they have limited movement. As a cult artefact,
the statue could be approached and touched by anyone in the act of worship. Of
course, the interaction was limited to movements that were part of a greater ritualis-
tic context. The statue was a mobile object, and was exhibited both outside and
inside. Its religious connotations have slowly been renegotiated into abstractions
which have brought the classical statue into new contexts – perhaps as a symbol of
its new owner’s pious nature and into a larger art collection. This collection
becomes a symbol of power where our classical statue is now a piece of art history.
It still bears connotations of religious meaning, but all the ﬂesh and meat of its ﬁrst
format have been stripped away and limited to generic Princes, scholars and merchants began to establish collections of artefacts, many
of them from earlier classical times, and to display them in their ornate houses. The
objects were located in a private space. They were only made visible to invited
guests, other nobles, scholars and artists in particular.

Other connotations attach themselves in every reinterpretation. In the negotiation
process, the classical statue has been brought indoors into a private library where
its last traces of colour are scrubbed away and limited to white – a necessity for the
owner who uses
to negotiate his own classical education and wealth
(Hetherington, p. 59ff.). Where before it was surrounded by ﬂowers, smoke and
stone, its new surroundings are wood panels, leather-bound books and carpets – an

it

environment unﬁt for dirty colour remains. The statue was exhibited in the privacy
of a home, but could be moved to different parts of that home in its function as a
decorative object. The ‘culture’ of the classical statue is now that of a classical
education, wealth and exclusivity, correlating with its latest format as a ‘hi-cult’
object – an object
that reinforces the taste of the bourgeoisie (see Eco 1964).
Although the transformation from a colourful feast goddess on a smoky ﬁeld into a
white-scrubbed symbol of classical education is drastic, the prime goal of the inter-
vening negotiations has never been to change the meaning of the classical statue
but to make it more accessible to society. The object of a change in format is to
make the artefact or goal as tractable as possible through mediation and composi-
tion (Latour 1994, p. 34). This holds true for the statue’s translation into a museum
artefact. Exhibited in a museum, it can be approached by anyone. However, the vis-
itors have to enter a milieu that demands a certain behaviour from both the visitor
and the statue. They are forced to keep a certain distance and the statue usually
remains still. Only those in the employ of the museum, either conservation scien-
tists or curators, are allowed to touch the artefact.

Read like this, it is easy to imagine an at ﬁrst curious statue moving about and
interacting with her surroundings. She then slows down and limits herself to slow
walks in the library, accepting audiences from close friends and business associates.
Finally, tired after a long life, the statue moves sleepily into a bright gallery to let
herself be admired one last time. With the promise from her supporting actants that
they will keep her from being disturbed, she falls asleep while new networks are
spun around her frozen form.

Through the sociology of translation, we can follow these negotiations between
actants, but it is the vocabulary of limitations that lets us identify and discuss the
deeper socio-cultural connotations – actants in their own right – that shape the shifts
of a translation. It gives us a tool to follow and understand cultural connotations as
actants which can be enrolled to affect the way a network reacts. With these quick
and basic limitations of movement identiﬁed, we look for their effect. As it is
brought into the library, the previous limitations of the statue are already at work
re-negotiating their place in this new milieu. Earlier, it was an artefact limited to
those wishing to express religious rituals and worship. It was not an everyday
object, but a representation of a goddess. Now it takes part in another kind of ritual.
The previous limitations to movements, integral to the cult format, are not in effect
any more. How could they be, in a modern society? They are still present, however,
in the way the collector presents his ﬁnd to his peers. Falling short only of building
a shrine to the statue, he boasts of his ‘goddess in stone’ and always bows to it
while leaving the room. He won’t try to emulate old cult practices, only to show
her some respect.

Finding its resting place within the galleries of

the museum, associations
brought on by earlier limitations of interaction accompany the statue. By now, all
social classes can approach the artefact, though it carries associations of a time
when that privilege was limited to the rich and educated. The new limitations on
our interaction with the classical statue, introduced with the museum format, act
as a distorted echo of earlier formats. We are ﬁnally invited into the hi-cult
library, but only as quiet observers. We are worshippers in the cult, but it is now
sterile and anachronistic. With hushed voices and slow movements, careful not to
touch, we look up towards the statue on its pedestal as if we were kneeling in
front of it.

Thinking through limitations
Cultural values are bound to socio-cultural practices and therefore lost when
removed from their context. The limitations marking the allowed borders of a for-
mat are body-less actants which need to be addressed when mediated. They repre-
sent an expectation which affects how the actor-network that makes up a translation
deals with borders and culture. Limitations related to movement and access consti-
tute one such contact with a border, and identifying others helps when tracing the
outlines of a format’s impact on society. What limitations were put on gender?
What were the limitations of representational techniques at the time? How did the
limitations of the available technology shape the exhibition?

What is often referred to as the affordance of a format – the repository of cues
shaping ‘the nature of content in a given medium’ (Sundar 2008, p. 75, also see Gib-
son 1977) – is really a palimpsest that can be read as revealing the negotiation pro-
cess of the translation and the limitations of previous formats. By applying the
vocabulary of limitations when describing a translation’s socio-cultural connections,
we do not accept the nature, or inherent action, of a format as a satisfying explana-
tion, but instead see affordance as just the residue of this negotiation process. Nature
is the consequence of the settlement (Latour 1987, pp. 99, 258). In an article about
French wine growers, Guille-Escuret notes that while weed killers made it unneces-
sary to work the land with a plough, ‘the wine-grower feels obliged to do so for his
own reasons’
(1993, p. 218). These reasons have their origin in socio-
cultural connections created from the limitations of previous farming formats; a well-
ploughed ﬁeld was a weed-free ﬁeld, and a weed-free ﬁeld was the mark of a farmer
with a good crop. Hence, even with weeds out of the picture, the farmer feels obliged
to work the ﬁeld to signal that he has a good crop. Since this is a well-anchored per-
ception among his potential customers, it could be argued that it makes economic
sense for the farmer to keep ploughing his ﬁeld, even if the land does not need it.

Modern electronic book readers emulate the limitations of the analogue book
format, dividing text into pages you have to turn. Initial controversies regarding
how the authors could, through this new digital format, update books even after
these had been bought, led to an artiﬁcial reinstitution of the old limitation of print
on paper: printed text, whether analogue or digital, is not to be modiﬁed. The idea
of the irreversible print – a limitation of the previous format – has become an
important part of the legal system and the way we reference and document informa-
tion as a dateable statement of an occurrence (Gitelman 2006, xi–xii).

Old limitations of previous formats are in this way emulated to nourish an
important connection with society. If, through translation, an artefact is too far-
removed from the format by which it is anchored to society – and as a consequence
from the network of enrolled actants spurred from the connotations of that format –
it loses its perceived ‘culture’ and has to form new connections with society in
another format. As in the case of the NAM, although the architecture is shaped by
the artefacts – primarily the Parthenon sculptures and the ongoing negotiations con-
cerning how they could be displayed – the communication of the artefacts is pri-
marily shaped by the classic museum format. The artefacts – together with a series
of non-human actants – have to work within the limitations of this format to enrol
the right set of actants in order to be accepted by the visitor as ‘culture’. Our classi-
cal statue could have continued in its format as a very real religious personiﬁcation
of a goddess, complete with rules for how to approach her, but in the sterile halls

of the NAM that would have been an artiﬁcial state without the possibility of
anchoring itself to the surrounding society. Over the centuries, a series of transla-
tions have negotiated the movements towards this new context and slowly brought
the statue from cult to ‘hi-cult’ and beyond, severing the continuation of limitations
brought on by the artefact’s early cult context and establishing new ones.3

Conclusion
A lot of things are new about the NAM, but not, in my opinion, the presentation of
our classical statue. The architectural ambitions and careful thematisation of the gal-
leries have not reached the individual objects, which remain museum artefacts
rather than alive. They communicate their present format rather than themselves
and their career, even if there remain connotative traces of the formats they have
travelled through. In this study I have exempliﬁed how the sociology of translation
can be used together with a vocabulary of limitations as an aid to help us identify
non-human actants of a translation connected to the artefact through socio-cultural
expressions rather than direct involvement. I have shown how ties to society are
present in a translation through these limitations and how they affect the negotiation
process concerning the ‘culture’ of the artefact. Furthermore, I have shown how the
format – the network of actants that disciplines how we approach and interact with
an artefact – establishes a connection to society that has just as strong a socio-
cultural signiﬁcance as the artefact itself, if not stronger. The format is an important
aspect of an occurrence consisting of a network of socio-cultural connections that
anchor the artefact to society. These connections can be identiﬁed through a vocab-
ulary of limitations which helps us deﬁne the format and understand how it has
shaped society around it. The limitations represent a series of unrelated connotative
values which do not translate to other formats since they are context-bound. They
are not seen as a set of limitations connected to the format but instead as a set of
natural rules – part of the way we approach an artefact.

The presentation of the classical statue is conservative since it has to negotiate
with the museum format about every aspect of the way it is exhibited in order not
to lose its socio-cultural connections. The artefact is not frozen, but it moves very
slowly as a consequence of all the required negotiations. Since our perception of
culture is dependent on the format, an abandonment of one format for another
would also mean the abandonment of a series of cultural connotations. We would
hesitate for a moment before pointing at the classical statue and exclaiming, ‘This
is culture!’ If it were exhibited among the machines at Centrale Montemartini in
Rome – an electrical power plant transformed into a museum of ancient Roman
artefacts – perhaps our ﬁrst reaction would be, ‘This is modern art!’

Not acknowledging a format negates the cultural connotations connected to it.
When preserving the memory of an artefact – through visualisation or digitisation –
it is good practice to ﬁnd a way to represent all formats of the artefact, not just the
present or a perceived ur-format. Since cultural values are tied to the usage – and
to the connotations and branching of that usage – the artefact is often a mere totem
of the culture built around it. Limitations constitute the borders of a cultural expres-
sion and permit – in a context of translation – an explanation of how cultural values
are mobilised and defended based on format rather than content. By preserving the
memory of how these limitations came to shape social institutions, we preserve
some of the artefact’s socio-cultural connotations to future generations.

Notes on contributor
the Department of Conservation, University of
Jonathan Westin is a Ph.D. student at
Gothenburg. He studies how we form our perception of ‘culture’ through representations.
The aim of his research is to describe how those procedures involved in the creation of a
scientiﬁc representation also (re-)construct and reinforce ‘culture’, if not always the ‘culture’
they set out to represent.
