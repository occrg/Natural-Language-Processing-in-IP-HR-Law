Post-application evidence of bad faith in
China’s Trade Mark Law
Jyh-An Lee and Hui Huang*

China amended its Trade Mark Law in 2013, and the
new law entered into effect on 1 May 2014. Since trade
mark hijacking, or trade mark squatting, is a serious
problem in China,1 one of the main goals of the new
law was to curb the bad-faith ﬁling of trade marks.2
Trade mark squatters proﬁt by registering other parties’
trade marks. They either sell counterfeit goods with the
trade mark or sell the registered trade marks back to
inﬂated rates.3 Some
the original mark owners at
believe that rampant bad-faith registration of trade
marks is the main difﬁculty faced by multinational
enterprises (MNEs) in achieving well-known trade

Commission on Commerce and Trade has agreed to

status

In many jurisdictions, bad faith has become an
essential ground against
trade marks registered by
squatters, potentially leading to the refusal of an appli-
cation, opposition or cancellation.6 For example, in the
EU, according to Article 59.1(b) of the EU Trade Mark
Regulation (Regulation 2017/1001), an EU trade mark
shall be declared invalid if the registrant was acting in
bad faith when he ﬁled the application. Under the EU
Trade Mark Directive (Directive 2015/2436), bad faith
is an absolute ground for refusal or invalidity (and a
relative one, in certain cases).7 In the UK, bad faith is
also an absolute ground of refusal of registration and of
invalidity of registration.8 As the Second Board of

post-ﬁling) evidence is considered by the Chinese
courts together with ex ante evidence (knowledge
of the mark at the time of the application for regis-
tration). We argue that this approach is reasonable
from a practical and comparative law perspective.

Appeals of the EU Intellectual Property Ofﬁce pointed
out in Claire Fisher,9 bad faith is a general limitation on
the ﬁrst-to-ﬁle doctrine in the trade mark system.

The determination of bad faith, however, remains
challenging for most trade mark practitioners. This is
not only because there is no clear deﬁnition of what
bad-faith trade mark registration is, but also because
there is no consensus on the evidence to be considered.
This article focuses on the timing of the evidence rele-
vant to bad faith, which has become an increasingly
critical point of contention for trade mark practice in
China. The Chinese courts used to opine that only evi-
dence existing before or upon application for a trade
mark could be used to establish bad faith. Evidence that
appeared after the deemed date could not be used for
this purpose. However, recent court decisions have
loosened the standard regarding the timing of relevant
evidence, with some courts beginning to consider evi-
dence appearing after the deemed date.

This article will ﬁrst introduce the bad faith provi-
sions contained in the Chinese Trade Mark Law and
trace the judicial development on the admissibility of
post-application evidence of bad faith. We will then dis-
cuss the International Trademark Association’s (INTA)
proposal and the practice of domain name dispute reso-
lution,
in other
jurisdictions.

Bad-faith registration in the Chinese
Trade Mark Law

The Supreme People’s Court (SPC) in China has urged
the country’s courts to curtail bad-faith trade mark
registration enforcing the Trade Mark Law.10 Section 1
of Article 7 in the Chinese Trade Mark Law introduces
the principle of good faith in ‘trade mark registration
and use’. This signiﬁes that the law aims to restrain
bad-faith trade mark registration and use.11 Section 1
of Article 15 forbids registration by the representative

or agent, while Section 2 of the same article provides
that:

An application for registering a trade mark for the same
kind of goods, or similar goods shall not be approved if the
trade mark under application is identical with or similar to
an unregistered trade mark already used by another party,
the applicant is clearly aware of the existence of the trade
mark of such another party due to contractual, business or
other relationships with the latter other than those pre-
scribed in the preceding paragraph, and such another party
raises objections to the trade mark registration application
in question.

In other words, knowing that a third party has an
unregistered trade mark for the same kind of goods or
similar goods is an example of bad faith interference.

There are four other articles in the Chinese Trade
Mark Law that speciﬁcally address bad-faith registra-
tion. Article 32 states that ‘No trade mark application
shall infringe upon another party’s existing prior rights.
Nor shall an applicant rush to register in an unfair
manner a mark that is already in use by another party
and enjoys substantial inﬂuence.’ Section 1 of Article 44
stipulates that ‘Where the registration of a trade mark
was acquired by fraud or any other unfair means, the
Trade Mark Ofﬁce shall declare the trade mark invalid.’
According to Section 1 of Article 45:

Where a registered trade mark is in violation of the second
and third paragraph of Article 13, Article 15, the ﬁrst para-
graph of Article 16, Article 30, Article 31 or Article 32 of
this Law, the holder of prior rights or an interested party
may, within ﬁve years upon the registration of the trade-
mark, request the Trade Mark Review and Adjudication
Board to declare the registered trade mark invalid. Where
the aforesaid registration is obtained with bad faith, the
owner of a well-known trade mark is not bound by the
ﬁve-year restriction.

Thus, well-known trade mark owners can always
request that the Trademark Review and Adjudication
Board (TRAB) declare the trade mark invalid if it is reg-
istered in bad faith, and such request is not subject to
the ﬁve-year statute of limitations. This is similar to
Article 6bis of the Paris Convention, which stipulates
that ‘[n]o time limit shall be ﬁxed for requesting the
cancellation or the prohibition of the use of marks reg-
istered or used in bad faith.’ The difference is that
Article 45 of the Chinese Trade Mark Law only regu-
lates registration in bad faith, whereas Article 6bis of
the Paris Convention copes with both registration and

use in bad faith. Moreover, Section 2 of Article 47 in
the Chinese Trade Mark Law states that ‘the bad-faith
trade mark registrant shall be liable for other parties’
losses’, provided that the trade mark registration is
declared invalid by the Trade Mark Ofﬁce, TRAB, or
the courts.

From the above, it is clear that, under the Chinese
Trade Mark Law, neither the bad-faith registration of a
trade mark for the same kinds of goods or similar
goods (Article 15.2) nor the bad-faith registration of a
trade mark involving another’s prior right or marks
already in use by those with substantial
inﬂuence
should be approved (Article 32). Moreover, the bad-
faith registration of a trade mark involving fraud or any
other unfair means should be declared invalid (Article
44.1). Well-known trade mark owners can always
request that TRAB declare the trade mark invalid if it is
registered in bad faith, with the privilege not subject to
the ﬁve-year
(Article 45.1).
Moreover, the bad-faith trade mark registrant shall be
liable for the other party’s losses if the registration is
declared invalid by TRAB (Article 47.2).

Judicial treatment of post-application
evidence of ‘bad faith’

In the application of the legal framework described
above, and especially of Article 45 of the Trade Mark
Law, the courts need to determine whether the trade
mark was registered in ‘bad faith’. Some practitioners
suggest that, in order to prove bad faith in registration,
one must show either the violation of a legal duty or
the infringement of prior rights.12 In the past, the
Chinese courts held that evidence regarding bad faith
should exist upon or before trade mark registration.
More recently, some courts have considered ex post evi-
dence, acquired after the application for registration.
This section provides an overview of this judicial shift
in China.

In Tai Yang Shen,13 the court ruled that the trade
mark application date is the deemed date to determine
bad faith, and the malicious transfer of the subject trade
mark after registration should not be considered as evi-
dence of bad-faith registration. The High People’s
Court of Beijing held that bad faith is based on
whether: (1) the registrant is aware of the existence of
another party’s well-known trade mark; (2) the regis-
trant has intentionally imitated and registered the sub-
ject mark for commercial purposes; and (3)
the
registrant is likely to proﬁt from the public’s confusion
between the well-known trade mark and the registered
trade mark.14 The First Intermediate People’s Court of
Beijing Municipality further stated that, in determining
whether the registrant acted in bad faith, the critical
date should be the application date for trade mark
registration. In other words, bad-faith registration refers
to malicious conduct in applying for registration, rather
than maliciousness after registration.

In MONIHAO and device,15 the High People’s Court
of Beijing held that the owner of the well-known trade
mark must prove that bad faith existed when the regis-
trant applied for trade mark registration. Trade mark
transfers after application cannot be used as evidence to
determine bad faith.16 Therefore, although the plaintiff,
Bonneterie Cevenole SAR, owned a well-known trade
mark, it could not invalidate the registered trade mark
ﬁve years after registration.17 In other words, if the
well-known trade mark owner fails to collect evidence
existing before or upon application to prove bad faith,

its complaint will still be subject to the ﬁve-year statute
of limitations.

However, in subsequent cases, the courts took a dif-
ferent approach. In the Jin Zhu JINZHU and device
case,18 the First Intermediate People’s Court of Beijing
Municipality took into account the following circum-
stances to determine bad faith registration: (1) the
registrant and the unregistered well-known mark holder
were in the same geographic region, and the registrant
was supposed to be aware of the mark (ex ante evi-
dence); and (2) the registered trade mark holders had
conducted various infringements and unfair competi-
tion practices after registration (ex post evidence).19 In
the case, decided in 2012, the disputed trade mark had
been approved for registration in 1984, making it very
hard to prove that there had been bad faith upon or
before the application date. However, after the registra-
tion, the disputed trade mark had been transferred a
few times and had been used as a tool by the trade
mark holder to conduct infringing activities. While rec-
ognizing the reputation of the prior well-known trade
mark, the trade mark holder, Shen Zhen Bao Song Li
Industrial Ltd., had anyway used the disputed trade
mark, as well as product packaging similar to those of
the prior well-known trade mark. As a result, such
malicious imitation had caused consumer confusion
and had been punished by the local administrative
authorities. Accordingly, the court ruled that the mali-
cious transfer and infringing acts that had taken place
after the application were sufﬁcient to prove bad faith.

This approach was conﬁrmed by the SPC in the Wei
Shi Da Yu Lan case,20 in which it acknowledged that
the conduct after application for registration of a dis-
puted trade mark can be evidence of ‘bad-faith registra-
tion’. The SPC held that the trade mark’s ‘well-known’
status was not an inference of ‘bad faith registration’.
Instead, the court should take all subjective and objec-
tive elements into account on a case-by-case basis. In
this case, the plaintiff and the defendant were both in
the cosmetics industry. The plaintiff’s trade marks were
well-known to the public before the defendant’s appli-
cation for registration, therefore the defendant ought to
have been aware of their existence at the time of regis-
tration. Further, the defendant’s conduct manifested its
intention to take advantage of the business reputation

of the plaintiff when using the trade mark, which sup-
ported the conclusion that the registration had been
made in bad faith. The evidence showed that
the
defendant had used the disputed trade mark, ‘Wei Shi
Da Yu Lan’, together with the Chinese character of
‘You’ and a device mark that was similar to the plain-
tiff’s (P&G) ‘Yu Lan You’ products. Meanwhile, the
defendant had also imitated P&G’s product packaging.
Taken together, such acts demonstrated the defendant’s
bad faith.

In Michael Jordan v TRAB, the SPC again considered
post-application evidence to infer bad-faith registra-
tion.21 The SPC found that the registrant, Qiaodan
Sports Co., was aware that Michael Jordan was a
famous athlete when it applied to register ‘Qiaodan’,
the transliteration of Michael Jordan’s last name into
Chinese, as a trade mark.22 In this instance, the bad
faith was self-explanatory and further conﬁrmed by the
registrant’s post-registration behaviour: the registrant
had subsequently applied for trade marks that transli-
terated the names of Michael Jordan’s two sons, Jiefuli
Jordan and Makusi Jordan.23

The cases above demonstrate a shift in the judicial
treatment of post-application evidence of bad-faith
registration. In both the Tai Yang Shen and MONIHAO
and device cases, the courts relied on the application
date as the sole determinant of time and were unwilling
to take into account conduct subsequent to application.
By contrast, in later cases like Jin Zhu JINZHU and
device, Wei Shi Da Yu Lan and Michael Jordan, the
courts took subsequent improper conduct, including
the transfer of a trade mark, free-riding on the repute
of the original mark and subject registration of relevant
marks, into account. Nevertheless, in those cases, the
courts always considered post-application conduct in
conjunction with ex ante evidence, never in isolation.

knowledge of the existing mark upon application,26
whether the mark is well known upon application27 and
whether the registrant has had business relations (such
as employment relations or a commercial partnership)
with the trade mark holder28 are all acceptable ex ante
pieces of evidence for the determination of bad faith. In
this part, we investigate post-application evidence of
bad faith from a comparative perspective and provide
some insights for China.

INTA’s proposal

The
International Trademark Association (INTA)
deﬁned the ideal standard for establishing a bad-faith
application or registration as follows:

(1) the applicant or registrant knew of the third-party’s
rights or legitimate interests in marks identical to or sub-
stantially identical
to the mark applied for/registered,
where such knowledge is actual or may be inferred from
the surrounding circumstances; and (2) the applicant or
registrant’s conduct in applying for registering the mark is
inconsistent with the norms of reasonable, honest, and fair
commercial behavior.29

the factors

Both standards address conducts associated with regis-
tration. INTA has also recommended ‘a non-exclusive
list of factors to be considered in determining whether
the applicant’s or registrant’s conduct is inconsistent
with norms of reasonable, honest and fair commercial
behavior.’30 Among others, one of
is
‘whether the mark was applied for/registered primarily
to sell, license, or otherwise transfer the registration to
the party opposing or seeking to cancel or to a competi-
tor of that party.’31 If the registration or application is
for the purpose of an ex post transaction, such as sale
or licence, it is quite natural that the court will consider
whether the ex post transaction occurred and whether
the transacting party used the trade mark to oppose or
cancel its competitor’s registration. Consequently, ex
post evidence will
logically be used to uncover bad
faith. Based on the non-exclusive list provided by
INTA, it is quite natural for a court to consider the
registrant’s post-registration transactions in order to

determine whether the registration was made in bad
faith.

Comparative law

It is widely recognized that bad faith should be discour-
aged when the registrant ﬁles an application for trade
mark registration. In the Lindt case, the Court of Justice
of the European Union (CJEU) indicated that the inten-
tion to prevent a third party from marketing a product
may, in certain circumstances, be an element of bad faith
on the part of the applicant, especially when it subse-
quently becomes apparent that the applicant applied for
the registration of a sign without intending to use it (his
sole objective being to prevent a third party from enter-
ing the market).32 In the determination of bad faith, the
CJEU held that it was for the national courts to make an
overall assessment taking into account all the relevant
factors speciﬁc to the case,33 in particular,

(a) the fact that the applicant knows or must know
that a third party is using, in at least one Member
State, an identical or similar sign for an identical or
similar product capable of being confused with the
sign for which registration is sought;

(b) the applicant’s intention to prevent that third party

from continuing to use such a sign; and

(c) the degree of legal protection enjoyed by the third
party’s sign and by the sign for which registration
is sought.

The three factors suggested by CJEU all existed upon
application. Therefore, it is not clear whether the court
can consider post-application evidence of bad faith.
Similarly, in the Yakult case, the CJEU had no chance
to consider facts that occurred after the date of ﬁling
when determining bad faith.34 Thus, from Lindt and
Yakult, it is not clear whether the CJEU can consider
positive post-application evidence of bad faith.

However, in two opposition cases, the CJEU made
some comments on the actual use of evidence ex post.
In the CK CREACIONES KENNYA case, the CJEU
ruled that the trade mark applicant’s wrongful conduct

was a particularly signiﬁcant
51(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94. The CJEU held that:

factor under Article

The General Court’s analysis was not vitiated by an error
of law due to the fact that it failed to take account of
alleged wrongful conduct on the part of the trademark
applicant. While such conduct is a particularly signiﬁcant
factor in proceedings brought under Article 51(1)(b) of
Regulation No 40/94, which is not at issue in the present
appeal, it is not, on the other hand, a factor that must be
taken into account
in opposition proceedings brought
under Article 8 of that regulation.35

It seems, therefore, that the CJEU does not object to
considering ex post positive conduct in order to decide
on the validity of a registration.

In the Master case, following a different opposition
procedure under Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/
2009, the CJEU held that ‘in essence, a ﬁnding of a risk
of free-riding may be established, in particular, on the
basis of logical deductions resulting from an analysis of
the probabilities and by taking account of the usual
practices in the relevant commercial sector as well as all
the other circumstances of the case, including the use,
by the proprietor of the mark applied for, of packaging
similar to that of the goods of the proprietor of the ear-
lier trademarks.’ Therefore, case law allows for consid-
eration of any evidence intended to facilitate an analysis
of the intentions of the proprietor of the trade mark
applied for, and, a fortiori, any evidence relating to the
actual commercial use of the mark applied for as well.36
In the UK, post-ﬁling evidence of bad faith was con-
sidered in the Betty’s Kitchen Coronation Street case.
The Trade Mark Registry concluded that the fact that
the registrant used ‘Betty’s Kitchen’ and ‘Coronation
Street’ separately indicated that the trade mark had
been applied for in bad faith.37 Since Coronation Street
is the name of a British soap opera, it was impossible
for the registrant to register a trade mark for those two
words alone. Although adding ‘Betty’s Kitchen’ made
the subject mark registrable, the registrant did not use
these four words together. As a result, the registrant’s

TMR, 21, 89 (‘although the appellants might not have purchased their
magazine with the intent to trade upon the appellee’s goodwill, their sub-
sequent actions justiﬁed an inference of bad faith’).

Some US courts have also used post-application evi-
dence to infer bad faith.39 For example, in a case involv-
ing a mark previously used and registered in a foreign
country, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
pointed out that bad faith in registration can be found
where ‘the [registrant’s] use is a nominal one made
solely to block the prior foreign user’s planned expan-
sion into the United States.’40 In other words, inferen-
tial proof of bad faith in registration can be shown by
the imitator’s post-registration token use. Compared to
the Chinese cases that consider post-ﬁling evidence of
bad faith in addition to knowledge during application,
the post-ﬁling evidence seems to play an even more
important role in the determination of bad faith in the
UK and US case law.

Lessons from domain name dispute resolution

and

trade

mark

Domain name registration is similar to trade mark
registration in many ways, especially in the context of
cybersquatting
squatting.
Cybersquatting refers to the registration of a domain
name with the intention of proﬁting from another
party’s trade mark contained within the domain name.
Both cybersquatters and trade mark squatters intend to
proﬁt from existing marks, and bad faith plays a simi-
larly important role in the legal treatment of cybers-
quatting and trade mark squatting. Therefore,
the
determination of bad faith in cybersquatting may pro-
vide some helpful insights into similar issues in the con-
text of trade mark squatting.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN) adopted the Uniform Domain
Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) as a general
policy to resolve primarily trade mark-based domain
name disputes. Paragraph 4(b) of the UDRP explicitly
requires bad faith to exist at the time of domain name
registration.41 However, a registrant’s behaviour subse-
quent to registration can also be used to predicate bad
faith at the time of registration.42 For example, quite a
few ICANN panels held that bad faith can be inferred if
a famous trade mark holder can prove that the regis-
trant attempted to sell the domain name to him.43

Some commentators refer to this inference as ‘retroac-
tive bad faith’.44

In the United States,

the Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) was enacted to
thwart cybersquatting.45 The ACPA lists nine factors for
the court to consider in the determination of bad-faith
registration.46 One of the factors is whether the regis-
trant offers ‘to transfer or sell the domain name to the
mark holder or any third party for ﬁnancial gain.’47
This is an ex post factor which occurs after the domain
name registration. Under the ACPA, the court may
determine that the domain name was registered and
used in bad faith based on conduct subsequent to
registration.

In Lahoti v Vericheck, the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit held that ‘[e]vidence of bad faith may
arise well after registration of the domain name.’48
Moreover, in Sporty’s Farm L.L.C. v Sportman’s Market,
Inc., the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit simi-
larly used post-ﬁling evidence to infer bad-faith regis-
tration.49 The evidence included: (1) the registrant had
not used the domain name in a genuine business until
after the start of litigation; and (2) the sale of the
domain name from the registrant’s parent company to
the trade mark owner occurred under ‘suspicious
circumstances’.50

Following the guidance of the UDRP, the Asian
Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC)
has considered ex post factors to determine respond-
ents’ bad faith as well.
In Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) v Li Xiaorong, which involved
the domain name ‘AIIB.org’, to determine the respond-
ent’s bad faith, the Panel of the ADNDRC (Beijing
Ofﬁce) held that ‘on its website it openly markets the
disputed domain name for a price of RMB3,000,000,
contradicting to their allegation. Lacking of persuasive
reasoning, the Respondent intentionally registered the
disputed domain with clear purpose to make bargain
with the Complainant, instead of making real use for
the alleged commercial entity.’51

In Tencent Holdings Limited v Li Ming, involving the
domain name ‘weixin.com’, the Panel of the ADNDRC

(Hong Kong Ofﬁce) listed the following acts of the
respondent as evidence of its bad faith: (1) alteration of
the content of its website; (2) misrepresentation of the
website as Tencent’s ofﬁcial website;
(3) use of
Tencent’s trade marks, such as the penguin device,
‘QQ’, on the website; (4) use of Tencent’s trade marks
on its ofﬁcial account on WeChat, the most popular
mobile social network in China; and (5) provision of
ﬁnancial incentives to users to follow certain ofﬁcial
accounts.52

Under both the UDRP and ACPA, and according to
the practice of ADNDRC, post-ﬁling evidence can be
used to infer bad faith upon registration. In both
regimes, bad faith can be determined based on how a
registrant makes use of the domain name after registra-
tion.53 The difference between bad faith in China’s
Trade Mark Law and in the UDRP and ACPA is that
Article 45 of China’s Trade Mark Law only requires bad
faith related to the mark’s registration, whereas the
UDRP and ACPA require bad faith in both the registra-
tion and use of the subject domain name. Nonetheless,
the inference of bad faith in registration under the
UDRP and ACPA can still provide a valuable reference
to resolve the problem of post-registration evidence of
bad faith under China’s Trade Mark Law.

Conclusion

Bad faith concerns the subjective status or intention of
a trade mark registrant. The proper path of inquiry is
to examine all the facts and circumstances to determine
whether there is evidence of bad faith. However, prov-
ing bad faith is usually quite challenging, as it is not
easy to collect evidence with regard to a registrant’s
intentions.54 From a practical point of view, a ﬁnding
of bad faith can be based on a reasonable inference
drawn from known facts.55 To do so, courts usually
need to look into a registrant’s behaviour.56

From a comparative perspective and a practical
viewpoint, we believe that the recent shift of Chinese
courts in favour of the admissibility of post-application
evidence of bad faith is the correct direction to take. If
courts were restricted to considering ex ante evidence

alone, it would be extremely difﬁcult to establish bad
faith in many cases. Moreover, the courts do not always
have sufﬁcient ex ante objective circumstances to con-
sider. The experience of domain name dispute resolu-
tion and the case law of EU, UK and US courts
illustrate that consideration of post-application evi-
dence is occasionally helpful or necessary to identify
bad faith registration. Nonetheless, as the purpose is to
prove bad faith registration rather than bad faith use,

there should be a reasonable link between registration
and post-application evidence. Currently, the Chinese
courts maintain the link by avoiding using post-
registration evidence alone to determine bad faith regis-
tration. This approach is reasonable and ensures that
such link is always present. Furthermore, with reference
to post-application evidence, this approach can effec-
tively alleviate the difﬁculty of proving the registrant’s
intention to act in bad faith.
