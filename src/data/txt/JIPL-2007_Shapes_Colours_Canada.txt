Protection of shapes and colour marks in Canada
Gary Partington*

Three-dimensional marks or shapes are protectable in
Canada either as ordinary three-dimensional
trade
marks or as distinguishing guises. Further, while they
are technically not
trade marks,
colour-shape marks may also be registered.

three-dimensional

If a mark is three-dimensional and falls within the
deﬁnition of a distinguishing guise in section 2 of the
Trade Marks Act,1 the mark is protectable in Canada
only as a distinguishing guise.2 A distinguishing guise is
deﬁned in section 2 of the Act as

(a) a shaping of wares or their containers, or
(b) a mode of wrapping or packaging wares, the appearance
of which is used by a person for the purpose of distinguish-
ing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured,
sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manu-
factured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others.

The word ‘wares’ in this deﬁnition is considered by the
Trade Marks Ofﬁce as meaning articles which would nor-
leased, or otherwise distributed in the
mally be sold,
marketplace.3 As a result,
three-dimensional
objects which would not normally be the subject of trade
fall outside the deﬁnition of a distinguishing guise and
may
three-
dimensional ordinary trade marks or as colour-shape
marks.

The Trade Marks Ofﬁce has also interpreted ‘dis-
tinguishing guise’ as applying to the shaping both of
the entirety of a ware or its container and of an integral
part of it.4 The Ofﬁce considers an interpretation of
‘shaping of wares or their containers’ as excluding a
shaping of both the entirety and a part of a ware or
its container to be inconsistent with the underlying
purpose of the special provisions of the Act relating
to distinguishing guises, since applicants could easily
circumvent the limitations in section 13 of the Act by
deleting a minor detail

obtaining protection for the remaining subject matter
as an ordinary three-dimensional trade mark.5

from the overall

Key issues
† In common with other industrial and commer-
cially sophisticated markets, Canada has had to
grapple in recent times with a rapid expansion in
the variety of elements that are the subject of
applications for trade mark registration.

† Responding to the challenge of determining
upon their registrability, Canada has evolved its
own approach towards the registration of shapes,
colours, and their combination, employing its
own terminology as well as its own unique
procedures.

† This article sets out to distinguish the Canadian
approach and to enable the foreign applicant,
when confronted with it,
to maximise his
opportunities for securing registration.

While there may be merit in the Trade Marks Ofﬁce’s
current interpretation of ‘distinguishing guise’, the statu-
tory wording neither indicates nor suggests that a dis-
tinguishing guise must be other than the shaping of the
entirety of a ware or container. A lid is not a container
even though it may be the container’s dominant visual
element. Likewise, the side mirror of a car may be an inte-
gral part of a car—but it is not a car. Nevertheless, two
decisions of the Trade Marks Opposition Board, discussed
below, ﬁnd a shaping of a portion of a ring and a shaping
of a stopper for a container to be distinguishing guise.

The Trade Marks Ofﬁce permits registration of a
non-integral part of a ware or its container as an ordin-
ary three-dimensional trade mark.6 Examples include a
sombrero design associated with bottles of tequila7 and
a representation of a monkey associated with the sale
of various products.8 Since such a mark is subject to
the same ﬁling requirements as any other design trade
mark, it does not necessitate the ﬁling of evidence to
show that it is distinctive in Canada.

The Trade Marks Ofﬁce has permitted a shape regis-
tration for wares or containers which are not inherently
or closely related to the goods or services covered in
the application.9 Thus, a three-dimensional represen-
tation of a biplane associated with the operation of a
retail clothing store should, for example, be protectable
as an ordinary three-dimensional trade mark.

Subsections 13(1) and 32(1) of the Trade Marks
Act list the following requirements for registering a
distinguishing guise:

13. (1) A distinguishing guise is registrable only if
(a) it has been so used in Canada by the applicant or his
predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the
date of ﬁling an application for its registration; and
(b) the exclusive use by the applicant of the distinguishing
guise in association with the wares or services with which
it has been used is not likely unreasonably to limit the
development of any art or industry.

32. (1) An applicant who claims that his trade mark is
registrable under subsection 12(2) or section 13 shall
furnish the Registrar with evidence by way of afﬁdavit or
statutory declaration establishing the extent to which and
the time during which the trade mark has been used in
Canada and with any other evidence that the Registrar
may require in support of the claim.

the guise sought

The evidence ﬁled with the Registrar must
show
that the distinguishing guise has become distinctive
in Canada to probable purchasers,
including the
ultimate consumers, as of the ﬁling date of the appli-
cation.10 This evidence is generally a function of the
inherent distinctiveness of
to be
registered. Thus, where a distinguishing guise
is
inherently strong, evidence of signiﬁcant sales and
advertising of the wares or services associated with it
may be sufﬁcient
the
guise had become distinctive in Canada. In contrast,
if
the Registrar may
require either survey evidence or afﬁdavit evidence
from actual purchasers showing that they recognize
the guise as distinguishing the owner’s wares or ser-
vices in the marketplace in Canada.11 A territorial
breakdown of sales in Canada, normally required by
the Registrar, may result in the distinguishing guise
registration being limited territorially within Canada
to the areas where it has been shown to have become
distinctive.12

the guise is inherently weak,

to satisfy the Registrar that

Whether a three-dimensional mark qualiﬁes as a dis-
tinguishing guise or is a three-dimensional ordinary
trade mark may be unclear. In such instances, having
regard to evidentiary and other relevant requirements,
an applicant may initially elect to seek to protect such
a mark as
trade
mark rather than as a distinguishing guise. Three-
dimensional marks used and registered abroad are
often submitted as ordinary three-dimensional trade
marks in Canada, these being based on the correspond-
ing foreign registrations (or pending applications),
coupled with use of the marks outside Canada.

three-dimensional

an ordinary

One advantage of ﬁling an application for regis-
tration of the three-dimensional mark as an ordinary
three-dimensional trade mark is that the Trade Marks
Ofﬁce normally permits an applicant, at the examin-
ation stage, to convert its application from such an
application into a distinguishing guise application in
response to an objection by the Ofﬁce that the three-
dimensional trade mark qualiﬁes as a distinguishing
guise. The Registrar views this amendment as not being
speciﬁcally excluded as an impermissible amendment
under section 31 of the Trade Marks Regulations.13
However, section 32(a) of the Regulations, which pre-
cludes any change to the trade mark after the trade
mark has been advertised, would not permit
the
change from ordinary three-dimensional mark to dis-
tinguishing guise after its advertisement for opposition
purposes.

In addition to permitting the conversion of an
ordinary three-dimensional trade mark application into
a distinguishing guise application, the Registrar may
also allow the ﬁling of an amended drawing, showing
any further view of the distinguishing guise in addition
to or in place of the view(s) of the three-dimensional
mark which accompanied the original application.
However,
the Registrar must be satisﬁed that any
additional view does not alter the distinctive character
or affect the identity of the original mark, as otherwise
the amendment would be contrary to section 31(b) of
the Trade Marks Regulations.

While the foregoing amendment may be accepted by
the Trade Marks Ofﬁce at the examination stage, the
fact
that additional views have been added to a
pending application may constitute a valid ground of
opposition under section 30(h) and paragraph 38(2)(a)
of the Trade Marks Act. In this regard, a prospective
opponent could allege inter alia that

If an ordinary three-dimensional trade mark
is subsequently opposed, consideration should
be given to re-filing the application
as a distinguishing guise application rather
than contesting the opposition

In most instances where the Trade Marks Ofﬁce has
permitted the conversion of an application into a dis-
tinguishing guise application,
the ordinary three-
dimensional trade mark application has been based on
use of the three-dimensional mark in Canada. The issue
arises as to whether it would be permissible to convert
an application based on use and registration of a trade
mark abroad into a distinguishing guise application
which is also based on use and registration abroad.
Since this amendment is not precluded by section 31 of
the Trade Marks Regulations,14 it should be acceptable
to the Registrar of Trade Marks. Furthermore, the same
criteria for showing acquired distinctiveness of a three-
dimensional mark in Canada in relation to a use-based
distinguishing guise application would apply to a
section 16(2) distinguishing guise application.

If an applicant has ﬁled an application for an ordin-
ary three-dimensional trade mark in Canada based on
registration (or a pending application) and use of the
mark in, for example, Switzerland, and assuming that
the applicant has a real and effective industrial and com-
mercial establishment in that country, will that regis-
tration and accompanying use justify the registration of
the three-dimensional mark as an ordinary trade mark
in Canada under section 16(2) of the Trade Marks Act?

Having regard to the provisions of Articles 6quinquies
A and B of the Paris Convention for the Protection of
Industrial Property, it would in theory be inappropriate
for the Registrar to refuse registration of the ordinary

three-dimensional trade mark which has been registered
in the applicant’s country of origin and in respect of
which a copy of the certiﬁcate of the registration has been
ﬁled with the Registrar. The applicant would certainly
meet the requirements of Article 6quinquies A of the Paris
Convention by having a real and effective industrial and
commercial establishment
in Switzerland, which is a
country of the Union. Further, if the three-dimensional
trade mark is inherently distinctive and does not fall
within any of the exceptions identiﬁed in Article 6quin-
quies B, the mark would not be precluded from regis-
tration by the application of Article 6quinquies A. Where
the mark is inherently distinctive, as contemplated by
Article 6quinquies B(2), failure to furnish evidence that the
mark had become distinctive as of the ﬁling date of the
trade mark application in Canada would not form a basis
for exclusion under Article 6quinquies B.

However, the Registrar of Trade Marks is required to
apply the provisions of the Trade Marks Act which would
take precedence over Canada’s compliance with Articles
6quinquies A and B. As a result, in the case outlined
above, the Registrar would likely conclude that the three-
dimensional mark would only be registrable in Canada as
a distinguishing guise if it constituted a shaping of wares
or their containers, or a mode of wrapping or packaging
wares. Furthermore, the Ofﬁce would likely raise the
objection that the applicant would not be able to show
that its trade mark was distinctive as of the ﬁling date of
the application since the application was not based on
use of the trade mark in Canada and section 31(d) of the
Trade Marks Regulations precludes amendment of the
application to include a claim to use of the trade mark in
Canada. Nevertheless, the foreign use and registration (or
pending application) abroad basis claimed in the appli-
cation is not inconsistent with the applicant’s use of the
three-dimensional mark in Canada, even though the
applicant has elected not to rely upon that use as a basis
for registration of its trade mark in Canada.

The Federal Court and the Opposition Board have ren-
dered several decisions relating to three-dimensional tablet
and capsule designs.15 Consequently, the jurisprudence
relating to these types of marks, while relatively well devel-
oped in Canada, is relevant primarily to pharmaceutical
companies. Most capsule and tablet design decisions turn
on issues of non-distinctiveness16 or non-compliance with

14 (SOR/96-195).
15 See, for example: Novopharm Ltd v AstraZeneca AB et al. [2004], 28 CPR
(4th) 129 (FCTD), 2003 FC 1212; Novopharm Ltd v AstraZeneca AB et al.
[2002], 21 CPR (4th) 289 (FCA), reversing 13 CPR (4th) 61 (FCTD),

(FCTD), reversing 81 CPR (3d) 558 (TMOB), afﬁrming 6 CPR (4th) 16
(FCTD), reversing 83 CPR (3d) 554 (TMOB).

16 As deﬁned in §2 the Trade Marks Act, ‘distinctive’ in relation to a trade

mark, means a trade mark that actually distinguishes the wares or
services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares
or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them.

the formal requirements of section 30 of the Trade Marks
Act. There have, however, been far fewer decisions invol-
ving three-dimensional marks other than tablet or capsule
design marks and which are of more general application.
As a result, the majority of the decisions referred to below
relate to non-tablet or non-capsule three-dimensional
marks.

The question often arises with respect

to three-
dimensional marks as to whether a prior industrial
design registration in Canada would preclude an appli-
cant from registering the subject matter of its industrial
design as either a three-dimensional ordinary trade
mark or as a distinguishing guise. A design or indus-
trial design is deﬁned in section 2 of the Industrial
Design Act17 as meaning ‘features of shape, conﬁgur-
ation, pattern or ornament and any combination of
those features that, in a ﬁnished article, appeal to and
are judged solely by the eye’. In WCC Containers Sales
Ltd et al. v Haul-All Equipment Ltd18 it was argued that
it is implicit in the grant of a monopoly under the
Industrial Design Act that the owner promises to dedi-
cate the design to the public following the expiry of the
design registration. In rejecting this submission, Kelen J
of the Federal Court commented:

First, legislative responsibility rests with Parliament and it
has not chosen to make industrial design protection and
trade mark protection mutually exclusive. In light of its
decision to explicitly limit the overlapping of industrial
design protection and copyright protection, it must be pre-
sumed that it did not feel it was necessary to create a
similar barrier between the Industrial Design Act and the
Trade Marks Act. Second, as the respondent has demon-
strated, it has been the long-held position of the courts
not to prohibit the registration of a design as a trade mark
even if it has already enjoyed the protection of an indus-
trial design registration. Third, neither s. 13(1)(b) nor the
concept of distinctiveness creates the needed foundation
for this restriction. They narrow the scope of trade mark
protection and limit its applicability to designs; but if a
design can ﬁt within the constraints of the Trade Marks
Act, then it is entitled to registration. Fourth, it is not
within the competency of this Court to read-in the restric-
tion sought by the applicants.

Having regard to WWC Containers, a prior industrial
design registration should not preclude the subsequent
registration of the same design as either a distinguish-
ing guise or an ordinary three-dimensional trade mark.
However, the prior registration of an industrial design

might have an impact on the issue of the functionality
of either the trade mark or the guise. The functionality
of a three-dimensional mark that was previously the
subject matter of an industrial design registration in
Canada was considered by the Trade Marks Opposition
Board in Intergold Ltd v Doherty.19 Cameron Doherty
applied to register his Ring Design as an ordinary three-
dimensional trade mark as applied to ‘commerce rings’,
asserting that the representation of the ring shown in
the dotted outline, represented below, did not form part
of the trade mark.

The Board Member determined that

the Ring
Design was a shaping of part of the wares and there-
fore fell within the deﬁnition of a distinguishing
guise. Further, the applicant’s prior industrial design
ornamental
registration evidenced the
the Ring
nature of
the
Design. The Board Member also noted that
applied-for mark was primarily functional
from an
ornamental perspective and did not appear to have
any existence other than as part of the applicant’s
ring. As a result, the applicant had failed to meet
the onus of showing that his mark was not primarily
functional
from either an ornamental or utilitarian
point of view.

Recalling the deﬁnition of ‘(industrial) design’ men-
tioned above, the prior industrial design registration
was not necessarily evidence of the primarily ornamen-
tal nature of the Ring Design mark since that regis-
tration may be directed at the shape or conﬁguration,
or both, of
the Ring Design, rather than to any
ornamentation of it.

trade marks

Functionality also arises in relation to both ordinary
three-dimensional
and distinguishing
guises. However, apart from section 13(2) of the Trade
Marks Act, referred to below, there is no reference to
functionality in either the Act or the Trade Marks
Regulations.20 Rather, the registrability of a trade mark
or the invalidity of a trade mark registration based on
functionality is found in the jurisprudence.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2007, Vol. 2, No. 12

In Kirkbi AG et al. v Ritvik Holdings Inc.; Attorney
General of Canada et al., Interveners,21 Lebel J of the
Supreme Court of Canada discussed the doctrine of
functionality as it applies to trade marks in Canada:

it is primarily functional from either a utilitarian or an
ornamental perspective in that the functionality relates
primarily or essentially to the wares (or services)
covered in the application.22

[42] The doctrine of

functionality appears to be a
logical principle of trade marks law. It reﬂects the purpose
of a trade mark, which is the protection of the distinctive-
ness of the product, not of a monopoly on the product.
The Trade Marks Act explicitly adopts that doctrine, when
it provides, at para. 13(2), that the registration of a mark
will not interfere with the use of the utilitarian features it
may incorporate:

13. . . .
(2) No registration of a distinguishing guise interferes
with the use of any utilitarian feature embodied in the dis-
tinguishing guise.

[43] In these few words, the Act clearly recognizes that
it does not protect the utilitarian features of a distinguish-
ing guise. In this manner, it acknowledges the existence
and relevance of a doctrine of long standing in the law of
trade marks. This doctrine recognizes that trade marks law
is not intended to prevent the competitive use of utilitar-
ian features of products, but
fulﬁls a source-
distinguishing function. This doctrine of functionality goes
to the essence of what is a trade mark.

that

it

The

issue

relating

to ornamental

functionality,
referred to in the Practice Notice and by the Board
Member in Intergold,23 appears to have ﬁrst been con-
sidered in W.J. Hughes & Sons ‘Corn Flower’ Ltd v Mora-
wiec.24 There, Gibson J of the Exchequer Court found
that a design trade mark, represented below, as applied
to cut glass tableware, was not used as a distinguishing
feature, it was not therefore a trade mark within the
meaning of section 2(m) of the Unfair Competition
Act.25 He also determined that, as so employed, the
design ‘had a functional use or characteristic being orna-
mental or part of the overall design on the cut glass
tableware’ on which it appeared. As well, Gibson J
found that the mark was not a trade mark in that the
owner did not intend to use the design or pattern as a
trade mark and did not in fact do so.

[44] In Canada, as in several other countries or regions
of the world, this doctrine is a well-settled part of the law
of trade marks. In the law of intellectual property, it pre-
vents abuses of monopoly positions in respect of products
and processes. Once, for example, patents have expired, it
discourages attempts to bring them back in another guise.
[45] The doctrine of functionality is a well-established
principle of the Canadian law of trade marks. Indeed, our
Court characterized it in 1964 as a ‘well-settled principle
of law’:

The law appears to be well settled that if what is sought
to be registered as a trade mark has a functional use or
characteristic, it cannot be the subject of a trade mark.

(Parke, Davis & Co. v Empire Laboratories Ltd, [1964]
SCR 351 at p. 354, 43 CPR 1, 45 DLR (2d) 97, per Hall J.)
[46] The Federal Court of Canada has consistently
applied this doctrine. As in the present case, it has held
time and again that no mark could consist of utilitarian
features. Otherwise, it would make the wares a part of
the mark and grant a monopoly on their functional
features.

Further, there is reference in the Three-Dimensional
Marks Practice Notice to a mark not being registrable if

if

Thus, in view of Hughes, the issue of ornamentation
appears to go to the issue of the mark being a ‘trade
mark’ as deﬁned in section 226 of the Trade Marks Act.
However,
the ﬂower design were applied to an
adhesive label afﬁxed to the glassware, it likely would
have been concluded that the design was being used as
a trade mark. If so, and apart from the mark being
three-dimensional, it is difﬁcult to understand why the
cutting of the pattern into the glassware would necess-
arily result in the mark being considered as ornamenta-
tion and therefore incapable of functioning as a trade

mark. Moreover, if a word trade mark were engraved
on the cut glass tableware, would it cease to function as
a trade mark?

The question also arises as to whether a mark is two-
or three-dimensional. For example, an unfolded box,
package or carton? While the Trade Marks Ofﬁce policy
regarding these types of marks is unclear, the Ofﬁce
appears to treat them as being equivalent to a two-
dimensional mark as applied to a three-dimensional
object.

One such mark was considered by the Federal Court
in an appeal from a decision of the then Chairman of
the Opposition Board in N.V. Sumatra Tobacco Trading
Co. v Imperial Tobacco Ltd.27 Sumatra applied to register
the design trade mark HERO & Design, a representation
of which appears below, based on use and registration of
the trade mark in Indonesia in association with ciga-
rettes and proposed use of the trade mark in Canada in
association with cigarettes and cigarette lighters.

therefore successful.28 On appeal, Mr Justice O’Keefe
said, of the section 30 issue:

It seems to me that the drawing in this case is the whole
unfolded cigarette package. Both the specimen and the
photocopy of the package indicate this. It seems to me
that the trade mark used by Sumatra in Indonesia and
intended to be used in Canada consists of wording and
other matter applied to a three-dimensional, six-sided
cigarette package. The trade mark applied for consists
of wording and other matter contained within a two-
dimensional, twenty-sided ﬁgure. In Calumet Manufactur-
ing Ltd v Mennen Canada Inc.; Gillette Canada Inc. v
Mennen Canada Inc. (1991), 40 CPR (3d) 76, MacKay J
stated at page 87:

Unless the mark consists solely of a word or words without
particular style, the Act requires that a drawing of the
trade mark and accurate representations of it be ﬁled with
an application for registration. It is the mark so depicted
in the drawing, reproducible with a certiﬁcate of regis-
tration, which then provides notice to the world of the
owner’s or registered user’s proprietary interest
in the
trade mark and which forms the evidentiary basis for
actions of
infringement or for expungement. Useful as
photographs and samples of a trade mark, including a dis-
tinguishing guise, may be upon application for regis-
tration,

in my view,

or for other purposes under the Act.

Sumatra disclaimed the right to the exclusive use of
the words KING SIZE and 20 CLASS A CIGARETTES
apart from the trade mark and provided English trans-
lations of some of the wording appearing in the trade
mark, but furnished no further description.

As a ground of opposition, the opponent alleged
that the application did not comply with section 30 of
the Trade Marks Act: the mark was not a trade mark in
that the specimens ﬁled in support of the application
showed that the alleged mark comprised a package
blank which, when folded or assembled, may be used
to package cigarettes. The opponent submitted that
Sumatra was seeking to register its mark in a form
different to that in which it would normally be pre-
sented to a consumer at the time of transfer; accord-
ingly Sumatra did not intend to ‘use’ its trade mark as
contemplated by section 4 of the Trade Marks Act.

The Board concluded that Sumatra failed to resist
the section 30 ground of opposition, which was

It is important that the drawing accurately depict the trade
mark as there is an important public interest in knowing
what trade mark the appellant intends to protect with the
application. I therefore ﬁnd that the Opposition Board
decision was not only reasonable, but it was correct.

In view of the Federal Court’s decision in N.V. Sumatra
Tobacco Trading Co. what steps might be taken should
an applicant wish to register a similar mark? A possible
answer is to include a description of the trade mark
which explicitly deﬁnes the trade mark in a manner
similar to the following:

The trade mark is a two-dimensional mark as applied to a
six-sided three-dimensional carton. The above drawing
shows the mark in a ﬂat perspective view in order to show
all aspects of the mark. The dotted outline shown above is
not part of the trade mark.

Further, as an unfolded package, box or carton trade
mark is treated by the Trade Marks Ofﬁce as being
equivalent
to a two-dimensional mark applied to a

three-dimensional object, the drawing of the trade mark
should show the outline of the mark in dotted format.

The Ofﬁce also appears to treat trade marks com-
prising one, or more, colour applied to the entire
visible surface or to particular portion(s) of the surface
of a three-dimensional object as being the equivalent of
a two-dimensional mark applied to a three-dimensional
object. These marks are sometimes referred to as
colour-shape marks even though the three-dimensional
shape to which colour is applied does not form part of
the trade mark. These marks include tablet design and
capsule design trade marks, but differ from marks con-
sisting of colour combined with the shaping of a ware
or
as
distinguishing guises.

its

While colour-shape trade marks are registrable in
Canada, most trade mark practitioners consider that
colour per se is neither registrable nor protectable.
However, it may still be arguable as to whether such is
the case. There are comments in the 1992 decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada in Ciba-Geigy Canada
Ltd v Apotex Inc.29 which at least suggests that colour
can function as a trade mark. Moreover in 1997, in a
decision of the Trade Marks Opposition Board in Cel-
liers du Monde Inc. v Dumont Vins & Spiritueux Inc.,30
the Board Member referred to Ciba-Geigy, commenting
that the decision appears to accept that colour can
function as a mark, it being a question of fact in each
case as to whether colour is associated with the com-
mercial origin of a product.

While colour-shape trade marks are registrable in
Canada, most trade mark practitioners consider that
colour per se is neither registrable nor protectable

That said, the current position of the Trade Marks
Ofﬁce is that a colour per se trade mark is not regi-
strable,31 following Smith, Kline & French v The Registrar
of Trade Marks.32 Strayer J said he was obliged to have
due regard to the comments of Noel J in Parke, Davis &
Co. v Empire Laboratories Ltd33 that a trade mark con-
sisting of colour alone could not be the proper subject

of a trade mark. However, as Strayer J observed, Noel J’s
comments in Parke Davis were obiter as the marks in
issue in that case were not limited to colour per se, but
rather were coloured gel bands which were used to hold
together two halves of a capsule. Nevertheless, Strayer J
concluded that the mark at issue before him was not a
trade mark which resided in colour alone. Consequently,
he found that a colour was registrable if restricted to a
particular shape and size of a three-dimensional object,
that is, a colour-shape mark.

When ﬁling an application for registration of a
colour-shape mark, it is necessary to submit a drawing
showing the visible features of the three-dimensional
object in dotted line, together with a description that
the trade mark consists of the particular colour(s) only
insofar as they are applied to the three-dimensional
object. The description should also identify the views
appearing in the drawings.

Even though colour-shape trade marks are registrable
in Canada, registering a colour-shape trade mark is
often not without its difﬁculties. Recently, most colour-
shape trade mark applications which have been ﬁled,
including almost all of the tablet design trade mark
applications, have been refused either initially by the
Registrar of Trade Marks in opposition proceedings34
or ultimately on appeal from the decision of the Regis-
trar by the Federal Court of Canada.35 Furthermore,
most of the oppositions involving colour-shape marks
have turned on the issues of distinctiveness or of the
colour-shape marks being clearly descriptive of the char-
acter of the wares associated with the marks, as opposed
to any ﬁnding that such marks are inherently unregi-
strable.

In assessing whether a particular colour-shape mark
is clearly descriptive and is therefore contrary to para-
graph 12(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act, the Registrar or
court should focus on what the mark describes. In this
regard, in Unitel Communications Inc. v Bell Canada,36
Gibson J said:

. . . The descriptive character must go to the material
composition of the goods or services or refer to an intrin-
sic quality of the goods or services which are the subject of
the trade mark. The test

Gary Partington . Protection of shapes and colour marks in Canada

ARTICLE

Thus, to be objectionable under paragraph 12(1)(b) of
the Act, the colour of the colour-shape mark must refer
to the intrinsic quality of the goods associated with the
mark. The fact that others may have adopted the same
or similar colours as applied to their goods does not
establish that the particular colour is descriptive of the
intrinsic quality of the goods. While third party adop-
tion may be of relevance to the distinctiveness of a par-
ticular colour-shape mark, distinctiveness can only be
addressed by the Registrar of Trade Marks in opposi-
tion proceedings in view of the provisions of section
37(1) of the Trade Marks Act. As a result, a clearly
descriptive objection to the registrability of a colour-
shape mark at the examination stage of an application
cannot be sustained where the objection is based on
the common adoption by others of the same or a
similar colour as applied to their goods.

As the issue of distinctiveness of a trade mark can
only be addressed by the Registrar in opposition pro-
ceedings, an applicant who expects to face an opposition
to his colour-shape trade mark application may want to
consider speciﬁcally identifying the colour(s) in the
application, for example, by reference to the Pantone
colour number. In this way, one may be successful,
should the mark be opposed, in limiting the third party
marks which might be relied upon by an opponent in
challenging the distinctiveness of the trade mark.

It is uncertain as to how a court would treat a Pantone
colour claim in Canada. For example, would a Pantone
colour claim to light blue mean that the relevant popu-
lation of third party marks comprises all blue marks or
only light blue marks? Conversely, if light blue is claimed
as the colour of a registered colour-shape trade mark, can
the registrant enforce its rights in its registered trade
mark against all blue marks or merely light blue marks?
These issues have yet to be addressed either by the Trade
Marks Opposition Board or by the Federal Court.

The position of the Trade Marks Ofﬁce in registering
colour-shape marks differs from the current position of
the Industrial Design Branch, which has interpreted
sections 13(1) and 13(2) of the Industrial Designs Act
as precluding any reference to the colour of an article,
or of any part thereof, in a registration of an industrial
design.37 However, the Design Branch accepts the ﬁling
of colour drawings or photographs with the industrial
design application provided that, when electronically
scanned by the Ofﬁce, they show the features of the

design clearly and accurately in black and white.38 The
subsequently issued registration will only include the
scanned black and white photographs or drawings of
the design. It is also possible to obtain industrial design
registrations
in Canada covering contrasting tones
which create a ‘pattern’ on the surface of an article as
shown in a black and white drawing.39

Whether an application is ﬁled for an ordinary three-
dimensional trade mark or for a distinguishing guise, it
is necessary to submit a drawing of the trade mark, as
required by section 30(h) of
the Trade Marks Act.
Further, the drawings shall be in black and white, no
larger than 2.75 inches by 2.75 inches or 7 cm  7 cm,
and shall not include any matter that is not part of the
trade mark.40 In order to show all of the details of the
mark, it may be necessary to include more than one
view of the three-dimensional mark in the drawing.
Further, to avoid any ambiguity as to what is rep-
resented in the various views of the trade mark, the
views should be speciﬁcally identiﬁed in the description
of the trade mark.

If the drawing includes two or more views of the
mark, it may be difficult to discern its finer
details when the trade mark is advertised for
opposition purposes in the Trade Marks Journal.

If the drawing includes two or more views of the
it may be difﬁcult to discern its ﬁner details
mark,
when the trade mark is advertised for opposition pur-
poses in the Trade Marks Journal. Nevertheless, this
issue has not been addressed in any decision of the
Federal Court or of
the Trade Marks Opposition
Board. The Opposition Board has however considered
the sufﬁciency of one-perspective view of a three-
dimensional trade mark. In Belcam Inc. v Hurteau &
Associe´s Inc.41 the applicant sought to register as a
design trade mark the mark shown below, based upon
use of the trade mark in Canada since at least as early
as March 1994 in association with ‘foam bath’ (trans-
lation). The trade mark was opposed on several bases,
including the allegation that the applied for mark did
not comply with section 30(h) of the Trade Marks Act.
While the conclusion reached may arguably have

Hurteau, it would nonetheless be advisable to include
at least two perspective views of the three-dimensional
mark in order to accurately show all details of the trade
mark. Furthermore, the two perspective views of the
mark should be included in the application when ﬁled.

In Hurteau,
the Chairman also found the three-
dimensional stopper to be a shaping of an important
and integral element of the container for a foam bath
and therefore a distinguishing guise, as opposed to a
three-dimensional ordinary trade mark.

As only the drawing of the three-dimensional mark
appearing in the Trade Marks Journal forms part of the
registration of a trade mark,42 it is advisable to conﬁrm
that any amendments to the drawing of the trade mark
appear in the advertisement of the mark appearing

As a ﬁnal matter, there is a question as to whether
section 4(1) of the Trade Marks Act43 relating to the
deemed use of a trade mark in Canada in association
with wares applies
to a distinguishing guise. For
example, if a distinguishing guise covering a shaping of
wares is normally sold in a package and therefore is not
visible to the consumer at the time of the transfer of
the property in or the possession of the wares, is the
distinguishing guise being used within the scope of
section 4(1)? Arguably, the distinguishing guise is not
being used as a trade mark as is normally contemplated
by section 4(1). However, the shaping of the wares can
be said to have become so well known that the average
consumer would be aware of the shaping of the wares
at the time of purchase in the marketplace even though
the shaping is not then visible. This issue has yet to be
considered either by the Registrar of Trade Marks in a
summary expungement proceeding under section 45 of
the Trade Marks Act or by the Federal Court.

the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of the wares, in

the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on
the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so
associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to
