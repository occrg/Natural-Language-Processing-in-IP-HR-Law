Through the eyes of Omani courts: Copyright

Al-Toqi v Ministry of Commerce
and Industry

regional

Ahmed Al-Toqi is an internationally acclaimed profes-
sional Omani photographer who has won numerous
national,
and international photography
awards.1 He publicizes his photographs and services
through his personal website, which includes samples of
his work.2 Al-Toqi‚Äôs website explains that he offers all
the photographs available on the website for sale in
print and digital formats and that he is also available
for commissioned work. The Ministry of Commerce
and Industry found photographs by Ahmed Al-Toqi re-
lating to Omani dates (the fruit), used them in a variety
of written pieces on the subject of date production, and
published these pieces in local Omani newspapers in
2011. The case related to three written pieces that fea-
tured Al-Toqi‚Äôs photographs. The Ô¨Årst piece featured a
single photograph and was published in three newspa-
pers; the second piece featured Ô¨Åve photographs and
was published in two newspapers; and the third piece
featured three photographs and was published in one
newspaper. The photographs in question had a water-
mark signature of Al-Toqi and the VC symbol, and both
were visible on the photographs that appeared in the
newspapers as part of the written pieces produced by
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Al-Toqi was not happy with the fact that his photo-
graphs had been used by the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry without his permission and without com-
pensation. The irony here cannot be escaped because
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is the body re-
sponsible for intellectual property policy in Oman.3 Al-
Toqi contacted the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
directly to inform them of the infringement of copy-
right in his photographs. When the Ministry did not ac-
knowledge the demands made by Al-Toqi, in 2012 he

its legal system is still not capable of ensuring the
protection of the most basic rights of authors under
copyright law.

Article 20 of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Law 2008. As such the use does neither entitle the au-
thor to any compensation, nor is his permission
needed.4 Al-Toqi appealed to the Muscat Court of
Appeal, which conÔ¨Årmed the decision of Muscat
Primary Court.5 He then appealed to the Supreme
Court which did not conÔ¨Årm the decisions of the previ-
ous courts, but rather decided that photographs are not
subject matter that is protected by the Copyright and
Neighbouring Rights Law 2008. It thus held that Al-
Toqi had no rights that had been infringed in this case.6

The decision of the Primary Court

Muscat Primary Court correctly understood that there
are situations in which the Copyright and Neighbouring
Rights Law 2008 permits members of the public via
Article 20 to use a protected work without the need to
seek the permission of the author. Like all copyright
laws, the Omani Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Law 2008 offers some exceptions to draw a balance be-
tween the rights of authors and the rights of users to use
these works in ways necessary for the protection of cer-
tain public-interests, such as freedom of expression, edu-
cation and preservation of culture. However,
the
Primary Court incorrectly applied Article 20 by using it
as a Ô¨Çexible fair use style exception, when instead Article
20 provides an exhaustive list of exceptions.7 The draft-
ing of Article 20 is cumbersome and includes in its Ô¨Årst
paragraph the second and third steps of the three-step
test, which is confusing to novice judges who‚Äîas appar-
ent in this case‚Äîmight assume that if these two condi-
tions are satisÔ¨Åed, the use will be permitted without the
need to identify a speciÔ¨Åc case within the sub-paragraphs
of Article 20.

The correct approach under the Copyright and
Neighbouring Rights Law 2008 for relying on a copy-
right exception under Article 20 requires identiÔ¨Åcation

It is interesting to contrast Article 20 of the Omani Copyright and
Neighbouring Rights Law 2008 with Article 29 of the Kuwaiti Copyright
and Neighbouring Rights Law 2016. The Kuwaiti Article 29 is a Ô¨Çexible

of a speciÔ¨Åc exception applicable to the use at hand in
one of the sub-paragraphs of Article 20, and‚Äîthen‚Äî
application of the second and third steps of the three-
step test to the facts of the case.8 This is conÔ¨Årmed by
Article 3 of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Regulations 2008,9 which restates the need to satisfy the
third step of the three-step test and introduces addi-
tional conditions to all permitted uses, including a re-
quirement for such uses not to be directly or indirectly
commercial. The exhaustive list of permitted uses under
Article 20 is extremely limited, but there are two excep-
tions that appear to be relevant to this case. The Ô¨Årst is
the quotation exception for the purpose of explanation,
illustration or criticism under Article 20(1). The second
is the exception for reproducing extracts of articles pub-
lished in newspapers or periodicals relating to public-
interest issues under Article 20(4).

In relation to the quotation exception, it is possible
to interpret this as encompassing photographs in a way
that permits a newspaper to publish a quotation of a
photograph, or a small version of it, for the purpose of
illustration, explanation or criticism. The Copyright
and Neighbouring Rights Law 2008 does not deÔ¨Åne any
of these terms and there is no jurisprudence from
Omani courts that can help us understand the meaning
of ‚Äòquotation‚Äô. However, the scope of the Omani quota-
tion exception appears to be narrower than the manda-
tory quotation exception under the Berne Convention,
which is not subject to the three-step test. Under the
Berne Convention, Member States are required to make
it ‚Äòpermissible to make quotations from a work which
has already been lawfully made available to the public,
provided that the quotation is compatible with fair
practice, and it does not exceed that justiÔ¨Åed by the
purpose‚Äô.10 The Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Law 2008 limits the enjoyment of this exception to the
purpose of ‚Äòexplanation, illustration, or criticism‚Äô, re-
quires the use to be ‚Äòcompatible with fair practice‚Äô and

the second and third steps of the 3-step test and therefore provides a
non-exhaustive list of exceptions.
The Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law 2008 is the Ô¨Årst Omani
copyright law to utilise the three-step test as a domestic precondition for
taking advantage of any exception. This law was issued to comply with
the Free Trade Agreement signed between the United States of America
and Oman and which also uses the three-step as the standard for permit-
ting exceptions to copyright protection as well as patent protection:

that ‚Äòit does not exceed that justiÔ¨Åed by the purpose‚Äô.
Imposing conditions on the use of the quotation excep-
tion is not uncommon. Goldstein and Hugenholtz note
that Member States of the Berne Union are ‚Äòpresumably
free to prescribe the conditions on which quotation is
permitted‚Äô,11 and there are domestic copyright laws that
have even narrower quotation exceptions than that of
Oman, such as the copyright exception under the
Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1998 of the United
Kingdom, which‚Äîbefore the 2014 reform (when the
UK introduced a self-standing quotation exception
within the new section 30(1ZA) of the Act‚Äîallowed
quotation only for the purpose of
‚Äòcriticism or re-
view‚Äô).12 However, it does not appear that Article 20(1)
would cover the use of Al-Toqi‚Äôs photographs in this
case. Article 20(1) requires the use to be for the purpose
of ‚Äòexplanation, illustration, or criticism‚Äô. The only rea-
sonable understanding of these purposes is that the ex-
planation, illustration or criticism must be of the work
quoted. Quoting a copyright work to explain, illustrate
or criticize an unrelated work cannot be a justiÔ¨Åcation
for relying on this work. For example, it is not logical
to permit someone to play an extract of a recording by
the London Symphony Orchestra in a documentary
made to criticize the architectural works of Zaha
Hadid. The musical quotation in this hypothetical ex-
ample is used in a work of criticism, but the criticism
in question is not of the quoted work and therefore the
exception cannot be invoked. This interpretation is
conÔ¨Årmed in the WIPO Guidance on the Berne
Convention which states that ‚Äòquotation consists of
reproducing extracts from a work either to illustrate a
theme or defend some proposition or to describe or
criticise the work quoted from‚Äô.13 In the case of Al-Toqi,
the newspaper pieces in which his photographs were
used were not pieces that explained his photographs, il-
lustrated their components or criticized them. Rather,
the articles concerned the production of dates in
Oman, and the photographs were used to highlight the
topic of
readers.
Therefore, the purpose for which the photographs were
quoted does not fall under the scope of Article 20(1) of
the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law 2008.

(dates) and attract

each piece

The other exception relevant to this case allows the
press to reproduce segments of articles published in
newspapers or periodicals relating to public-interest

issues. Unlike most of the sub-paragraphs of Article 20,
sub-paragraph (4) does not use the term ‚Äòwork‚Äô, but
rather the term ‚Äòarticle‚Äô (maqalah) to indicate that this
exception only applies to written works. The exception
is limited further by only applying to articles relating to
economic, political or religious issues. This exception
appears to be rooted within freedom of expression, and
provides a mechanism to enable members of the public
to be informed about pressing issues by allowing news-
papers to freely copy extracts of public-interest articles.
Furthermore, the exception permits newspapers to pub-
lish only ‚Äòextracts‚Äô of an article, not the whole work.14
Finally, and interestingly, this exception can only be re-
lied upon if the author of the article has not ‚Äòreserved
[the republication] right at the time of publication‚Äô.
This is a unique condition that appears to allow the
press to use this exception only if the author has not
declared that all uses of the work are prohibited with-
out permission. Like all the other members of the Berne
Convention, copyright protection in Oman is auto-
matic and does not require the author to take any ac-
tion to be able to enjoy it. However, for this speciÔ¨Åc
case, the author of a work may enjoy greater or lesser
control over the use of his/her work in regard to this
exception, depending on whether he/she has reserved
the rights over its use. The photographs of Al-Toqi that
were used in this case were watermarked with his signa-
ture and the VC symbol. Even though the decision of the
Muscat Primary Court is rather concise, the court pass-
ingly interpreted the VC symbol to signify that ‚Äòthe use
of the photograph is not permitted‚Äô. This suggests that
this exception may not be relied upon if the author
merely attaches
to his/her work.
However, the primary reason why this exception cannot
be relied upon to reproduce photographs in this case is
the fact that it only applies to written works‚Äîsuch as
newspaper articles‚Äîand not also photographs.

In addition to the limitations found in relation to
each of these two exceptions, it is also possible to argue
these exceptions do not apply to the case in question
due to the general restrictions on permitted uses found
in Article 3 of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Regulations 2008. Article 3 of the Regulations requires
the permitted use not be directly or indirectly for proÔ¨Åt.

including the Arabic Oman Daily, Al-Watan and

Al-Shabiba. Two of these are issued by for-proÔ¨Åt enter-

Article 3 of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Regulations 2008.

Finally, there is an argument to be made that the use
in question does not satisfy the second and third steps
of the three-step test. The victim of copyright infringe-
ment in this case is a professional photographer whose
livelihood depends on his ability to commercially ex-
ploit his works with institutions, such as governmental
entities and the press. It is not unreasonable to recog-
nize that any unauthorized use by these subjects use

Muscat Primary Court did not go into any elaborate
analysis of the nature of exceptions provided by the
Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law 2008. Rather,
it merely stated that Article 20 permits copying of a
work as long as the name of the author and the source
are attributed, if such uses do not conÔ¨Çict with the nor-
mal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably
prejudice the legitimate interests of the original author.
Muscat Primary Court held that the name of the author
was attributed in the newspaper pieces (through the
watermarks that the photographer added to his photo-
graphs) and therefore the use was permitted under
Article 20 even if the source of the photograph was not
acknowledged. The decision appears to assume that the
conditions of the second and third steps of the three-
step test were satisÔ¨Åed. The court did not recognize the
need to identify one of the sub-paragraphs of Article 20
as the basis for permitting the unauthorized use. This
clearly is an incorrect application of the law as was illus-
trated in the discussion above.

In comparison to the error made by the Supreme
Court, the error of the Primary Court does not appear
too unforgiveable, given the complex wording of Article
20 of the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Law
2008. The Supreme Court did not attempt to identify a
provision under
the Copyright and Neighbouring
Rights Law 2008 that would justify the unauthorized
use of Al-Toqi‚Äôs photographs. Instead, it simply de-
clared that photographs are not subject to copyright
protection and, accordingly, that Al-Toqi has no rights
over their use.

Oman is a member of numerous international treaties
that explicitly require the protection of photographs
by means of copyright. These include the Berne
Convention,15 the TRIPS Agreement16 and the Free
Trade Agreement with the United States of America.17
Domestically, the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights
Law 2008 also explicitly recognizes photographs and
similar works as a category of protected copyright sub-
ject matter.18 Photographs might not enjoy an identical
standard of protection as other works under certain
copyright regimes, and the Berne Convention permits
states to protect photographs for a shorter term than
other artistic works as long as this term lasts for at least
the photograph.19
25 years from the production of
However,
the Omani Copyright and Neighbouring
Rights Law 2008 treats photographs in the same way as
other literary, artistic and scientiÔ¨Åc works, and protects
them for a term that lasts for the lifetime of the author
plus 70 years after his/her death.20 There is absolutely no
justiÔ¨Åcation for the Supreme Court to deny the qualiÔ¨Åca-
tion of photographs as a subject matter for the enjoy-
ment of copyright protection. The only explanation for
this decision is the ignorance of the judges in Oman of
the basics of copyright law.

The decision of the Supreme Court

Conclusion

The full text of the decision of the Muscat Court of
Appeal is not available, but it appears that it conÔ¨Årmed
the decision of the Muscat Primary Court and that is
why the photographer made a Ô¨Ånal appeal
to the
Supreme Court.

Due to the inadequate reporting of court decisions in
Oman, it is difÔ¨Åcult to assess the extent to which the
Omani judiciary is failing to ensure the protection of
copyright in Oman, but the fact that the Supreme
Court in this case neglected to recognize the protection

of copyright over photographs suggests that there is a
lack of understanding of the most basic aspects of copy-
right law at the highest level of the Omani judiciary.
What is even more concerning here is that the copy-
right infringer in this case was the government itself,
notably the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, that
is,
the body responsible for developing intellectual
property policy and raising awareness of intellectual
property issues.21 Government is not only failing to up-
hold the rights of Omani authors, but is it also infring-
ing their rights by using their works without their
permission.

This case also underscores how little membership to
treaties helps local creators.
international copyright
Even though Oman is a member of
the Berne
Convention and the WTO, and is a signatory of numer-
ous bilateral
investment and free trade agreements,
these international treaties give rights to foreigners for
the protection of their intellectual property rights, but
not to its own nationals. The failure of Oman to protect
the copyright of its own nationals is not considered a
violation of any of international law commitments. The
Berne Convention requires a state to protect the works
of the nationals of other Member States, not works of
the nationals of that state itself.

Notwithstanding inadequate copyright protection,
photography remains as one of the most popular forms

of creative production in Oman. Professional photogra-
phers manage to sustain their professions using busi-
ness models that do not require monopoly rights. For
example, Omani photographers, such as Al-Toqi, may
get paid through commissioned work, and may rely on
self-help solutions to ensure that they can still sell their
photographs even if they are shared. Such self-help so-
lutions include using watermarks and selling photo-
graphs
formats.
Photographers in Oman also enjoy a special attention
from the Sultan of Oman himself as the Omani
Photographic Society is technically a governmental en-
tity funded and supervised by the Diwan of Royal
Court.

in framed high-resolution print

Copyright might not be the most vital legal instru-
ment for supporting photographers in Oman, but it
does provide them with a level of protection that is nec-
essary for certain business models. The existence of
copyright law also gives photographers an expectation
of how their works may be used. Courts must uphold
the law and ensure that these expectations are met. If
the Omani Government truly believes that copyright
law is a matter worth protecting, then it must recon-
sider its capacity-building initiatives at all judicial and
administrative levels, and make sure that copyright law
is drafted in such a way that creators and users are in a
position to predict how courts will interpret the law.
