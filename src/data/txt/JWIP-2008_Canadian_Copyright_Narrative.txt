A Canadian Copyright Narrative

Daniel J. Gervais
Vanderbilt University Law School

Copyright policy, like other major areas of public policy, requires a solid anchoring in
fundamental principles. The perceived need to anchor copyright debates in a solid policy
context and, hence, to develop a coherent (and hopefully convincing) narrative has been the
subject of excellent contemporary research. We are indebted to a number of scholars for their
work in this area. The attempt to ﬁnd normative applications from a historically derived
model for copyright is not either. However, the research thus far tends to provide a blurred
picture, by espousing justiﬂcatory theories based on one or many of the following:
commercial and personal Interests of authors, understood as property and/or liability rules;
commercial interests of publishers and other ‘‘rights holders’’; and/or the social costs of
overprotection and the related economic-driven search for an optimal point of protection.
This article looks at pieces in the Canadian narrative puzzle and tries to present a faithful
picture of its current stage of evolution. To do so, however, a detour via England is required,
because that is whence the soil from Which the Canadian narrative comes. This historical
detour will be the focus of Part 1. Part III will suggest a path for the next stages of the
Canadian narrative that is both consistent with international norms and hopefully useful in
moving the debate forward. The part ends with a brief look at the impact that the linkage
with trade rules may have on copyright.

Copyright policy, like other major areas of public policy, requires a solid anchoring
in fundamental principles. That anchor can only be found through a clear under-
standing of the purpose of copyright.

One could rely on public choice theory and posit that by allowing various
stakeholders to push their issues the end-result will be balanced. From a pragma-
tist’s perspective, the theory rests on three key assumptions. First, that all interested
parties are represented by (equally) well-equipped experts. Second, that these
experts have correctly analysed not only the current state of play but also the
predictable future and correctly devised measures (including, but not limited to,
legislative amendments) that will adequately align the regulatory framework with
their objectives. Third, the end result of blending the various ‘‘adequate’’ and well-
formulated proposals in a single politically acceptable package will maintain the
(correct) analysis of each (equally well equipped) lobby and not produce unintended
or negative consequences. If one accepts that these assumptions are well founded,
then by all means the government and parliament should limit themselves to a
clearinghouse function whose main objective is to keep everyone equally happy (or
as minimally unhappy as possible).

One may also disagree with one or more of the above assumptions. I will
declare myself to be one of those sceptics, one who believes that proper policy is
made when the policy objective is identiﬁed from a national interest perspective, not
just by mosaicing sectoral interest groups, and then an objective analysis of the
measures designed to implement the objective is performed that takes into account
possible unintended consequences. I suggest that the ﬁrst step is to develop a
coherent discourse, a narrative. This is what I suggest is needed in the copyright
domain. The power of a narrative is at least three-fold: it guides policy-making; it
assists courts in interpreting copyright laws; and, with proper education, it increases
understanding and, hopefully, internalization of copyright norms.

To develop a copyright narrative, one probably should begin by looking at the
roots of the current system. One of the problems of copyright policy in North
America is that it is a house built on someone else’s foundations, although at times
we are not exactly sure whose foundations. This is nothing new. After all, Canada
and, in a different way of course, the United States have ‘‘imported’’ the common
law, the French Civil Code (Louisiana, Quebec) and several other parts of their
legal ediﬁce, state, provincial and federal, from other countries. There are differ-
ences, however, between copyright and, for example, the common law. The volume
of contract, property and tort cases, as well as doctrinal debates, restatements,
etc.—interspersed with numerous statutory interventions of course—have allowed
us both to understand the origins of common law rules and to transform, and
adapt, many of the underlying common law concepts. Can the same be said of
copyright? Seventeenth-century debates in Britain, and elsewhere in Europe from
which the ﬁrst copyright statutes emerged, had the great merit of forcing the courts
in those jurisdictions to examine the whys and wherefores of copyright law with
much greater depth than was the case in North America, until recently.

The perceived need to anchor copyright debates in a solid policy context and,
hence, to develop a coherent (and hopefully convincing) narrative has been the subject
of excellent contemporary research. We are indebted to a number of scholars for their
work in this area (see, inter alia, Bently, 2001; Feather, 1994; Ginsburg, 1990b; Hesse,
1990; Hughes, 2006; Jaszi, 1991; Nimmer looseleaf; Patterson, 1968; Rose, 1993;
Seville, 1999; Woodmansee, 1984). The attempt to ﬁnd normative applications from a
historically derived model for copyright is not new either. However, the research thus
far tends to provide a blurred picture, by espousing justiﬁcatory theories based on one
or many of the following: commercial and personal interests of authors, understood
as property and/or liability rules; commercial interests of publishers and other ‘‘rights
holders’’; and/or the social costs of overprotection and the related economic-driven
search for an optimal point of protection.

In Part II of this article, I will look at the Canadian narrative and attempt to
present a faithful picture of its current stage of evolution. To do so, however, a
detour via England is required, because that is whence the soil from which the
Canadian narrative comes. This historical detour will be the focus of Part I. Part III

consistent with international norms and hopefully useful in moving the debate
forward. That part ends with a brief look at the impact that the linkage with trade
rules may have on copyright.

Part I: The British Narrative

A look at British copyright history is useful to understand Canadian copyright
history.1 The history of copyright in Britain did not start in 1709 with the Statute of
Anne. Early in the sixteenth century, the ‘‘stationers’’ (the forefathers of modern
publishers) had organized themselves in a guild known as the Stationers Company,
and guild membership insisted upon exclusivity of publication. In other words, no
guild member could publish, without authorization, a book already published by
another member. Naturally, questions emerged rather quickly concerning the
enforcement of the exclusivity stemming from guild membership against non-
members, that is, ‘‘outsiders’’ (see Cornish and Llewelyn, 2003, pp. 345–6). This
objective was achieved by combining a ban on the importation of foreign books (in
1534)2 and the grant by Queen Mary of a charter (enforceable erga omnes) to the
Stationer’s Company (in 1556). The charter allowed the stationers to search out and
destroy any book printed in contravention of the statute of proclamation (see
Cornish and Llewelyn, 2003, pp. 345–6). As a result, only books licensed by the
stationers could be registered and legally printed in the United Kingdom, as entries
in the register were restricted to company members. This served both the interests of
publishers and of the Crown, which could maintain a degree of control over new
publications. Interestingly, the system was enforced both through the Star Chamber
and, for Elizabeth and her Stuart successors, through the Church, no doubt a
reﬂection of the deep religious struggles of that period.3

The stationer’s privileges:

outlived the ignominy into which the Star Chamber fell, being kept up by
the Long Parliament and conﬁrmed in 1662 after Charles II’s restoration.
But he allowed it to lapse in 1679; and, while James II revived it for
seven years in 1685, it could not last long in the political climate of
his dethronement. Parliament ﬁnally refused to renew it in 1694. The
stationers, who had argued forcefully against their loss of protection, were
left with such claim to ‘‘copyright’’ as they could make out of their own
customary practices surrounding registration (Patterson, 1968, p. 346).

John Milton4 and John Locke were instrumental in this ﬁght to put an end to
this ‘‘licensing’’ regime, which they (rightfully) considered as a form of prepublica-
tion censorship (Rose, 1993, pp. 28–32). Milton became famous in copyright history
for another reason: his contract with printer Samuel Simmons, by which Milton
gave over to Simmons ‘‘all that booke copy or manuscript . . . with the full beneﬁt
proﬁtt & advantage thereof or which shall or may arise thereby’’ (Lindenbaum,
1992, p. 441) in Paradise Lost for the sum of d20, was used as evidence both

that authors were entitled to proprietorship in their work (as far back as the 1660s)
and that publishers were (and are) treating authors unfairly (Lindenbaum, 1992,
pp. 452–4).5

John Locke’s name is of course central to the debate. His name was used to
justify extensive copyright protection as a natural property right ﬂowing from an
author’s labours. Locke’s most famous words in this context are:

Every man has Property in his own Person. This no Body has any Right
to but himself. The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we
may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the State
that nature hath provided, and left in, he hath mixed his Labour with,
and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his
Property. It being by him removed from the common state nature placed
it in, that excludes the common right of other Men (Locke, 1967, Book
II, paragraph 26).

Three remarks are in order. First, while this statement justiﬁes a property right
derived from labour, the context here is clearly manual not intellectual labour.
Consequently, the property that Lockean theory justiﬁes is ﬁrst and foremost
tangible property because that type of property is rivalrous. One thus needs to be
able to exclude all others from using one’s property. Not so with literary or artistic
works. They are non-rivalrous, and exclusion of others is not required for me to
enjoy my copy. What is rivalrous, however, is proﬁt. It is much harder for two
publishers to proﬁt from the same book in the same market at the same time than if
one of them has a monopoly on the book.

Second, authors do not work from what ‘‘nature hath provided’’, but rather
(at least in part) from what other men and women have created before, standing, as
it were, on the shoulders of giants.6

Third, Locke’s theory assumes continuing labour to continue to enjoy exclusivity
(Locke, 1967, Book II, paragraph 51). It is not surprising, then, to read from his own
hand that, while he favoured a temporary exclusive right for authors in literary works
for the life of the author plus 50 or 70 years (Locke, 1884, pp. 208–9)—Locke seemed
to have less sympathy toward the publishers’ monopoly7—he was also aware of the
need for the material to enrich the public domain:

I know not why a man should not have liberty to print whatever he
would speak . . .

That any person or company should have patents for the sole printing of
ancient authors is very unreasonable and injurious to learning; and for
those who purchase copies from authors that now live and write, it may
be reasonable to limit their property to a certain number of years after
the death of the author, or the ﬁrst printing of the book, as, suppose,
ﬁfty or seventy years. This I am sure, it is very absurd and ridiculous that
any one now living should pretend to have a propriety in, or power to

dispose of the propriety of any copy or writings of authors who lived
before printing was known or used in Europe.

Leaving Locke’s theory aside for a moment,8 we see that after approximately a
century and a half of exclusive privileges, amounting to indirect censorship granted
to the stationers and in a political climate where those privileges could be renewed
(thus leaving the stationers with no protection erga omnes), debates concerning a
statute focusing on the rights of both authors and publishers started in earnest in
England in the closing years of the seventeenth century (Patterson, 1968, p. 20). A
bill eventually passed in 1709, the Statute of Anne, granted ‘‘authors and their
assigns’’ the sole right and liberty of printing books for a period of 14 years from
ﬁrst publication.9 However, enforcement of the right (still) depended on registering
the book’s title with the Stationers’ Company.

Why do authors enter the picture at that point in the story? The fact that the
Statute granted the right ﬁrst not to the stationers but to the author—a major
difference from the stationers’ monopoly that was in place until 1694—was the
direct result of the stationers’ reliance in their petition to parliament on the natural
right of the authors in their works. This was in fact a pan-European strategy
of publishers (see Chartier, 1994). Focusing the attention on authors allowed
booksellers to achieve their aims, while avoiding the problem of defending their
unpopular trade monopoly.10 That said, to see the author merely as an excuse to
grant an exclusive right would be an oversimpliﬁcation.11 Authors did want rights
they could enforce themselves, even though most of them were happy to work with
publishers. There was, in other words, a timely convergence of interests. On the one
hand, authors were basking in the sun of the Enlightenment, stroked by the rays
of individualism.12 On the other, the stationers’ advocated in favour of a right
for authors of which they would be the assignees, through the then-prevailing
patronage arrangements. They understood that they needed a justiﬁcatory theory
other than greed or, indeed, their desire to survive to convince both the parliament
and the public.

The Statute was not the ﬁrst right accorded authors in Europe. The role of the
author as ‘‘right-holder’’ had emerged in France in the early days of the sixteenth
century. A French court granted the equivalent of an injunction to prevent an
almanac from being sold without the consent of its author (Rose, 1993, pp. 17–9).
The court’s reasoning was close to modern trademark/passing-off principles in that
it was afraid the author’s reputation might suffer if a book with his name on it was
published without his consent. Yet this case, and the many cases that would follow,
support Mark Rose’s observation that:

[In] the early modern period, in connection with the individualization
of authorship . . ., there developed a general sense that it was improper
to publish an author’s text without permission. The acknowledgement
of an author’s interest in controlling the publication of his texts
is not necessarily the same as the acknowledgment of a property right

in the sense of an economic interest in an alienable commodity (Rose,
1993, p. 18).

One might speak more of propriety than property in such a context.13
A parallel set of arguments in England at the time was that if authors had an
obligation not to write libellous, defamatory or otherwise unacceptable content
(which they had), then authors should have a coextensive right in their writings.
Following in the footsteps of Milton and Locke, satirist Daniel Defoe argued that
prepublication control was unnecessary; that a copyright should be granted to all
authors; and that their content could be controlled by prosecuting ‘‘offenders’’ after
publication (Rose, 1993, pp. 34–5). Ex post control as opposed to ex ante licensing,
in other words. Examples of his diatribes include: ‘‘Twould be unaccountably severe
to make a Man answerable for the Miscarriages of as thing which he shall not reap
the beneﬁt of it well perform’d’’ (quoted in Rose, 1993, p. 35), and ‘‘[w]hy have we
laws against House-breakers, High-way Robbers, Pick-Pockets, Ravishers of
Women, and all kinds of open violence and yet no protection for an author?’’
(quoted in Rose, 1993, p. 37).

Contrary to Lockean arguments based on the author’s labour (see Gordon,
1993; Locke, 1967, Book II, paragraph 4–15),14 Defoe’s argument
seems
to rest more on the complementarity of punishment and reward. According to
Professor Rose:

Defoe’s agitation on behalf of authorial rights seems to have inﬂuenced
the London stationers, who perhaps saw in his call for a law to protect
authorial property a new strategy for pursuing their own interests . . . in
1707 the stationers submitted a new petition to Parliament for a bill to
secure property in books. Making for the ﬁrst time no reference to the
revival of licensing, the stationers’ petition emphasized the negative
effect that the disorder in the trade was having on authors (Rose, 1993,
pp. 35–6).

The entry into force of the Statute in 1710 raised the question of whether it
abolished or superseded common law copyright. Common law copyright had been
chieﬂy concerned with preventing the ﬁrst publication of a work without the
author’s consent, as were several courts in civil law jurisdictions. Only after its
ﬁrst publication did the book enter the (different) realm of commercial exploitation.
Authors and publishers tried to convince various courts that the Statute had not
superseded the pre-existing, perpetual common law copyright. Booksellers, on the
other hand, including a number of Scottish booksellers who were happy to reprint
‘‘public domain’’ English titles,15 argued that if common law copyright ever existed,
it could not be enforced after the expiry of the new statutory monopoly. The
stationers thus decided to support Defoe’s parliamentary lobbying efforts. Simply
put, they were happy to see perpetual property rights vested in authors, provided
those rights would be assigned to them.

Alexander Pope was one of most active members of the English author
community at the time. His famous case against Edmund Curll16 is considered a
major precedent even today (Rogers, 1972). Curll had published a series of letters
on various subjects written by several authors, including Pope. This publication was
unauthorized although many commentators believed that Pope—who, as a gentle-
man, could not seek ‘‘media exposure’’ directly—was not wholly unhappy that
someone else generated that exposure on his behalf (see Rose, 1993, p. 60) (which
reminds one of ‘‘scandalous’’ photos and stories leaked by fading Hollywood stars
to the tabloids). Quite importantly for our purposes, it was probably the ﬁrst case
that clearly separated the tangible property in the letter (belonging to the recipient)
and the author’s property in the (intangible) content, an important abstraction.
After doing so, the court was able to rule in Pope’s favour:

I am of the opinion that it is only a special property in the receiver,
possibly the property of the paper may belong to him; but this does not
give a licence to any person whatsoever to publish them to the world, for
at most the receiver has only joint property with the writer.17

The case foreshadowed the debate, and highlighted the divide between those
who advocated authorial rights in the broadest sense and those who preferred to
limit common law rights to unpublished content.18 Indeed, a number of injunctions
had been issued in the Chancery to stop unpublished manuscripts from being
published19 (see Cornish and Llewelyn, 2003, p. 304). But could the common law
judges be convinced to go in the same direction?

In Tonson v Collins,20 Benjamin Collins, a Salisbury bookseller, was prevented
from reprinting copies of The Spectator. The plaintiff had purchased all rights to the
book. The case was heard en banc by all common law judges.21 There was
agreement among the parties that authors were protected at common law from
the unauthorized ﬁrst publication of their work. The disagreement focused squarely
on whether common law copyright in published works survived the Statute of Anne
and, if so, to what extent. The outcome of the case was inconclusive22 but it allowed
Lord Mansﬁeld (previously William Murray and a good friend of Pope), who acted
on behalf of the plaintiffs, to develop in detail his pro-author views.

Lord Mansﬁeld may still have had those views in the back of his head as Chief
Justice of the King’s Bench a few years later. Moreover, Tonson laid the ground for
the next big case, Millar v Taylor.23 By then, Mansﬁeld was on the bench and,
writing with the majority in a three to one decision, ruled that the author’s common
law copyright existed in perpetuity both in published and in unpublished works.
Various members of the court based their decision on Lockean, labour-based
arguments (see Gordon, 1993; Locke, 1967, Book II, paragraphs 4–15) and/or
general (im)propriety arguments. Justice Edward Willes, for instance, wrote that it
‘‘is certainly not agreeable to natural justice, that a stranger should reap the
beneﬁcial pecuniary produce of another man’s work’’. But Justice Richard Aston
wrote that the ‘‘invasion of this sort of property is as much against every man’s

sense of it, as it is against natural reason and moral rectitude’’ (quoted in Rose,
1993, p. 79). What Justice Aston had in mind was clearly a full property interest,
whose scope was further explicated by Lord Mansﬁeld:

. . . it is just that an author should reap the pecuniary proﬁts of his own
ingenuity and labour.24 It is just, that another should not use his name,
without his consent. It is ﬁt that he should judge when to publish, or
whether he will ever publish.25

In this brief quote, we ﬁnd three of the four components of the full modern
copyright, namely: the right to control economic exploitation of the work; the right
to prevent its publication; and the ‘‘moral right’’ not to see one’s name used without
consent, although not the dual nature of the latter right’s justiﬁcation (author and
public). Lord Mansﬁeld explained that an author’s name ‘‘ought not to be used,
against his will. It is an injury, by a faulty, ignorant and incorrect edition, to
disgrace his work and mislead the reader’’.26

The question of common law copyright surviving the statute did not die until
Donaldson v Becket. Thomas Becket and a group of booksellers, who had obtained
the rights to The Seasons and other Thomson poems, obtained an injunction in
Chancery against Edinburgh bookseller Alexander Donaldson, who had reprinted
the poems after the expiry of statutory protection. The case27 made its way to the
peers, who ended up overturning the injunction and deciding that no common law
copyright in published works had survived the Statute of Anne. But it was a narrow
victory (Cornish and Llewelyn, 2003, pp. 347–8). On the question of whether the
author’s common law right survived authorized publication, the common law
judges, who had been asked to provide their opinion to the peers (who, in those
days, all voted, lawyers and laymen alike), voted 6–5 against the right. According
to Professor Rose, the vote was actually 6–5 in favour of the authors but was
not reported correctly (Rose, 1993, pp. 98–111). The case was a turning point in
copyright history:

The legal principle at stake in the Donaldson case has signiﬁcant ethical
implications. If copyright is a form of limited monopoly granted
through statute, based on policy considerations, and not an absolute
common law right, the ethical burden of proof shifts to copyright
holders to show that their property interests are more important than
the public good of having access to information. The ethical issue takes a
metaphysical turn when we ask, as we shall in section II, just what it is
that constitutes the intellectual property protected by copyright. Again,
if the ‘‘substance’’ of intellectual property is constituted by statutory ﬁat,
then the limitations of the right are not analogous to limitations of
natural rights (Alﬁno, 1991, p. 3).28

By 1770, it was clear that there was a common law right only to prevent ﬁrst
publication, and a statutory right that prevented reprinting of a book for 14 years—

a term that would eventually be extended. In getting to this conclusion, arguments
based on moral impropriety had at least as much weight in swaying parliament and
the courts as labour-based narratives. In fact, copyright in eighteenth-century
Britain may be characterized as moving from propriety to property.

Professor Brad Sherman’s work has shown (Sherman, 1995, p. 1) that the
subsequent evolution of copyright law in the United Kingdom during the nineteenth
century29 was that of a system open to inﬂuences of emerging international norms30
and developments in Prussia, Saxony and France. Heuristically, it is less important
for the purposes of understanding the foundations of the Canadian system.

Part II: The Canadian Narrative

If one were to try to identify the purpose of copyright law in Canada, ofﬁcial
government documents would provide no clear guidance. In fact, it is often believed
that this quest is unnecessary and unproductive:

Copyright is in effect a right to prevent the appropriation of the
expressed results of the labours of an author by other persons. That
an author should have this right, at least for a limited period, is generally
recognized—on the ground of justice, expediency, or both.

The right is regarded by some as a ‘‘natural right’’ on the ground that
nothing is more certainly a man’s property than the fruit of his brain. It is
regarded by others as not a natural right but a right which the state should
confer in order to promote and encourage the labours of authors. . . . We
ﬁnd it unnecessary to go on record with a conclusion of faith in either
doctrine to the exclusion of the other (Isley Commission, 1957, p. 9).

The absence of a clear focus was still visible in 1971, when copyright was

aggregated with other intellectual property as a facet of ‘‘innovation policy’’:

The laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and registered industrial
designs must therefore be seen as taking their place in a much broader
group of innovation policies. In the aggregate, innovation policy must
seek not only to achieve an appropriate commitment of resources
to innovation and to improve the efﬁciency of individual policies
towards this end, but also to arrive at an appropriately balanced
mixture of different policies working together (Economic Council of
Canada, 1971, p. 12).

. . . All four [patents, copyrights, trademarks and registered industrial
designs] work in essentially the same way. The state creates an incentive
for individuals and ﬁrms to do more of certain things by granting them
limited rights in intangibles (Economic Council of Canada, 1971, p. 31).

Daniel J. Gervais

Commenting on the 1971 Report, the 1985 Committee, which produced A
Charter of Rights for Creators (House of Commons, Standing Committee on
Communications and Culture, 1985), stated:

The Report on Intellectual and Industrial Property was issued in January
1971. The Council was of the view that intellectual property should be
included in any discussion of economic policy. The economic aspects of
copyright were highlighted, with consumers’ interest as an important
focus of the debate. Two members of the Council, representing labour
interests, did not concur completely and felt that the Report should have
been more pro-creator. The economic approach also led to concerns
about the balance of payments implications of copyright, concerns that
recur to this date (House of Commons, Standing Committee on
Communications and Culture, 1985, p. 2).

Keyes and Brunet (1977) went perhaps farther than any other in attempting to
provide the best narrative. In providing its own view as to the proper foundation of
copyright protection, the Committee added:

In most countries it is generally accepted that creators are entitled to a
degree of protection for their work, on the grounds that a creator should
beneﬁt from the fruits of his labour. If creators are guaranteed a
minimum protection, they will be encouraged to create new works,
thereby enriching the cultural life and fabric of the country and adding
to the store of information (Keyes and Brunet, 1977, p. 2).

The report goes on to state:

The English law, from which the Canadian Act is derived, has developed
copyright law as a species of property rights, as distinct from personality
rights, notwithstanding the difﬁculties of reconciling the modern day pecu-
liarities of authors’ rights with the concept of property. . . . Copyright law
in Canada reﬂects the theory of intellectual property which emphasizes
authors’ property interests (Keyes and Brunet, 1977, pp. 4–5).

And this: ‘‘The purpose of copyright, as expressed in the past, has been to
guarantee the private property rights of creators’’ (Keyes and Brunet, 1977, p. 22).
In 1984, the government released another copyright report, namely a White
Paper infelicitously entitled From Gutenberg to Telidon (Government of Canada,
1984).31 It began with the following stipulation: ‘‘Copyright in Canada is the legal
recognition of the exclusive right of a creator to determine the use of a work and to
share in the beneﬁts produced by that used’’ (Government of Canada, 1984, p. 1).
The White Paper subscribed to a justiﬁcation of copyright on a natural rights
(property) basis and explained that, although copyright was an important incentive
for creation, it was not the main force that leads to new creations. Consequently, the
report suggested that a utilitarian justiﬁcation for copyright was unfounded.

A Canadian Copyright Narrative

From the preceding quotes, it is easy to see that in Canada neither the government
nor the parliament ever adopted a consistent copyright narrative, tapping instead
haphazardly several possible policy justiﬁcations. As Professor Scassa noted:

The history of copyright reform in Canada . . . suggests legislative
ambivalence about the purpose of copyright law. At one point, propo-
sals for copyright reform in Canada emphasized protection of the inher-
ent right of the author to the fruits of his or her labour. More recently,
courts and authors have adopted the view that copyright legislation serves
to provide a limited monopoly to authors as an incentive to produce
works that will beneﬁt society (Scassa, 2003–4, p. 57).32

Can Canadian courts ﬁll the policy gap(s)? Until 2001, Canada had the 1911
British Act, itself the result of a complex set of commercial and policy considera-
tions. We also produced myriad white papers, studies and commission reports, but
can one use any one of them to point to clear general principles of copyright that
inform the formulation of detailed rules? Simply put, at least until 2001 Canada did
not have a coherent copyright narrative, and it remains questionable as to whether
one exists now or not.33

One could argue that a policy for copyright is emerging at the Supreme Court
of Canada. In the Supreme Court trilogy of Th ´eberge v Galerie d’Art du Petit
Champlain inc. (Th ´eberge), CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada
(CCH) and Society of Composers, Authors & Music Publishers of Canada v Canadian
Assn. of Internet Providers (SOCAN),34 the court has provided parts of the missing
Canadian copyright narrative. This narrative is neither complete nor perfectly
articulated (Craig, 2002, pp. 18–20), but the importance of those cases should not be
underestimated. Absent a clear (and unlikely) different direction from the parlia-
ment, the Supreme Court’s dicta will provide Canada’s narrative for years to
come—at least to the extent that it will shape the decisions of lower courts.

First, a quick presentation of the cases. Th ´eberge was an action brought by a
well-known Canadian artist, Claude Th ´eberge, who had licensed a printing press to
make posters of one of his works. An art gallery (with no privity of contract with the
artist) purchased the posters and used a resin-based process to transfer the ink from
the poster onto canvases, thus creating painting-like reproductions. The central
question before the court was whether there had been an unauthorized reproduction
of the painting. The court found in the negative by a 4–3 vote, because, according to
the majority, a ‘‘reproduction’’ involves an increase in the net number of copies in
existence, which had not happened in ink because the ink transfer process destroyed
the poster copy as it created the canvas-backed reproduction. Interestingly, although
the court found that there had been no primary infringement, it proceeded to explain
the role of exceptions in, and origins of, Canadian copyright law.

CCH was a case brought by legal publishers against the Ontario Bar, whose
‘‘Great Library’’ was providing a photocopy service to its members. Photocopies
could be made on the spot or sent to members (lawyers) across the province of

Ontario. Photocopies ﬁled as evidence were of judicial decisions, law review articles
and chapters from legal textbooks. The court had to decide whether the photocopies
were reproductions of (original) works and, if so, whether copyright had been
infringed. The court found that most of the materials were original, but that the
photocopies were not infringing because the Bar could invoke the fair-dealing
exception of research (on behalf of its patrons).

The SOCAN case dealt with an appeal of a decision by the Copyright Board of
Canada (which, like the UK Copyright Tribunal, sets tariffs in certain instances
where collective management organizations are in place) concerning use of music on
the internet. The Canadian performing rights collective SOCAN was trying to get a
tariff in place to collect fees from internet service providers (ISPs) for music
streaming. The court found that ISPs had no liability because (as ISPs) they had
no control over the content.

The ﬁrst policy volley was ﬁred in Th ´eberge by Justice Binnie:

The Copyright Act is usually presented as a balance between promoting
the public interest in the encouragement and dissemination of works of
the arts and intellect and obtaining a just reward for the creator (or,
more accurately, to prevent someone other than the creator from
appropriating whatever beneﬁts may be generated). . . .

The proper balance among these and other public policy objectives lies
not only in recognizing the creator’s rights but in giving due weight to
their limited nature. In crassly economic terms it would be as inefﬁcient
to overcompensate artists and authors for the right of reproduction as it
would be self-defeating to undercompensate them. Once an authorized
copy of a work is sold to a member of the public, it is generally for the
purchaser, not the author, to determine what happens to it.

Excessive control by holders of copyrights and other forms of intellectual
property may unduly limit the ability of the public domain to incorporate
and embellish creative innovation in the long-term interests of society as a
whole, or create practical obstacles to proper utilization. This is reﬂected
in the exceptions to copyright infringement enumerated in ss. 29 to 32.2,
which seek to protect the public domain in traditional ways such as fair
dealing for the purpose of criticism or review and to add new protections
to reﬂect new technology, such as limited computer program reproduction
and ‘‘ephemeral recordings’’ in connection with live performances.

This case demonstrates the basic economic conﬂict between the holder
of the intellectual property in a work and the owner of the tangible
property that embodies the copyrighted expressions.35

While still partly inspired by Lockean labour-desert rationale, Th ´eberge arguably:
(a) identiﬁed the purpose of copyright (‘‘a balance between promoting the public

interest in the encouragement and dissemination of works of the arts and intellect and
obtaining a just reward for the creator’’); (b) adopted economic concepts36 to evaluate
the alignment of the Act’s interpretation with that purpose; and (c) concluded that the
chattel rights of the owner of the poster outweighed the interests of the owner of the
copyright in the underlying artistic work (in this case, the artist himself).

Th ´eberge’s teachings lie at the core of copyright law. The court tells us that
users, who are also very often owners of copies of protected works, have ‘‘rights’’.
Some of those rights follow from their ownership of a copy. Other rights stem from
exceptions that limit the reach of the author’s exclusive rights. It is the combina-
tion of both sets of rights that creates the appropriate ‘‘balance’’ in copyright law,
that is, a level of protection that sufﬁciently protects authors and other owners
of copyright, whether seen ex ante as an incentive to create (or investment in the
publication, production or dissemination of copyright works) or ex post as a
reward for that creation and/or investment, without creating deadweight loss (or
generating social costs without corresponding beneﬁts in the form of access to new
creations). The court showed reluctance in trampling those ‘‘rights’’ of users,37
which it deﬁned both as the owners of copies and the beneﬁciaries of statutory
exceptions.

In CCH,38 beyond conﬁrming the adoption of Th ´eberge’s ‘‘balanced ap-
proach’’, the court tackled two truly fundamental aspects of copyright law, namely
the notion of originality and the scope of fair dealing. The court examined the
British and American notions of originality and ostensibly opted for a middle path
that, operationally, is similar to the US standard established in Feist. The court
chose not to follow the ‘‘basic’’ (if not simplistic) notion of UK law as portrayed in
the University of London Press case,39 because it concluded that a ‘‘raw’’ skill and
labour (‘‘sweat of the brow’’) approach was unsatisfactory. Trivial and mechanical
labour will not do; something more is required.

The court stopped the wheels of infringement for similar reasons: it would be
incompatible with the quest for ‘‘balance’’ to limit recourse to technologies that can
be used for clearly non-infringing purposes, such as a photocopy machine. In
concluding that end-users have a right of fair dealing, the court exhibited reluctance
to extend copyright into the private sphere of end-users. Logically, it concluded that
asking the Great Library to monitor and enforce copyright on behalf of rights
holders would tip the balance too much in favour of the right holders themselves. In
interpreting the scope of exceptions, the Supreme Court took the view that it was
necessary to interpret fair dealing broadly in light of the Act’s purpose.40

The court’s decision in CCH is another clear indication of the limits of
copyright’s reach and of an attempt to align it with its purpose, in particular, when
its power to exclude should yield to other rights. In deciding that end-users did
not have to get permission, the court reinforced the view that those end-users
should normally not have to get a licence to access content. Copyright issues
should ideally be dealt with elsewhere in the distribution chain (e.g. at the level of
distributors and databases), not in the hands of end-users. This narrative is clear

and, in my view, unmistakably in keeping with British copyright history: the
proper sphere of economic copyright rights consists of commercially relevant uses
and reuses.

In SOCAN, unsurprisingly, the Supreme Court found that ISPs were not
liable to copyright owners when they act as mere conduits of content. The decision
adopted a resolutely economic/utilitarian approach41 linked to a search for the
underlying purpose of copyright law. The court’s analysis led quite logically to a
public good/public interest analysis. The choice of applying instrumentalist
reasoning42 was logical for the same reasons: copyright’s purpose is not to
‘‘protect’’ authors (or other owners of copyright), but rather to maximize the
creation, production and dissemination of knowledge and access thereto. In other
words, protection is not an end, in and of itself, but rather, a means to achieving
that purpose, which implies that the level of protection must be properly
calibrated.

The court also pondered the importance of copyright protection (and its
underlying purpose of maximizing the creation and dissemination of works) against
competing general welfare objectives:

The capacity of the Internet to disseminate ‘‘works of the arts and
intellect’’ is one of the great innovations of the information age. Its use
should be facilitated rather than discouraged, but this should not be
done unfairly at the expense of those who created the works of arts and
intellect in the ﬁrst place.

The issue of the proper balance in matters of copyright plays out against
the much larger conundrum of trying to apply national laws to a fast-
evolving technology that in essence respects no national boundaries.43

In other words, if the internet is a public good, the ISPs are its guardian, even
though they are in for proﬁt. As such, it would be economically inefﬁcient to impose
a liability on them merely to transit content they do not control.

Carved from the same wood as Th ´eberge and CCH, SOCAN set limits to the
reach of copyright. It also directly confronts copyright’s purposes with other,
potentially different policy objectives. The court also showed great reluctance in
imposing liability on intermediaries, which, while they are professionals in their own
right (in this case, ISPs; in CCH, the Great Library), are not professionals of the
copyright business,44 at least not to the extent that their roles are considered here.
The subtext, I suggest, is that the ‘‘business of copyright’’ should be handled by
those who publish, produce and disseminate works and actually choose the content
that gets disseminated (broadcasters, publishers, etc.). Another implication of the
decision is that copyright, as a statutory scheme, is not ‘‘property’’, and as such the
property-related rhetoric of theft and piracy is suspect.

Canada thus has jurisprudential pieces of a narrative puzzle. It is not complete,
but general principles can be sketched out from the Supreme Court trilogy. The

A Canadian Copyright Narrative

Canadian copyright narrative, if it is allowed to emerge, is good news for at least
one simple reason: the presence of a statement of principles will provide heuristic
help in enhancing both understanding and predictability.

To take a counter-example, the United States seems to have forgotten its core
narrative after 1976, especially after it let a group of lobbies write the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.45 As a result, it is now in a policy split between,
on the one hand, a simple, even simplistic property-based discourse46 used as a
rhetorical expedient to convince Congress to pass new rights to ﬁght internet
distribution and, on the other, a pragmatic trade regulation approach. The results
are well known, as are the negative public relations and commercial results of the
invasion of the private sphere of internet users (Gervais, 2004c, p. 39). ‘‘‘‘[P]iracy’’
seems to function as a rhetorical tool, implicitly advocating a normative agenda in
favour of some kind of property or ownership . . . effectively using ‘‘robbery’’ as a
trope to advocate property rights for authors’’ (Hughes, 2006, p. 1010). While
Professor Hughes has shown that recourse to this terminology is not of recent
origin, it seems undeniable that it is increasingly used to feed anti-instrumentalist
narratives.47

Part III: Moving Forward

The Two Faces of Copyright
According to the emerging Canadian narrative, copyright is perhaps best viewed as
a coin. On the economic side, born from the stationers’ monopoly and the Statute of
Anne and anchored in the need to organize markets for copyright works, we ﬁnd a
set of rights that, although poorly expressed, were designed to prevent commercially
relevant uses and reuses of protected works. For 300 years, this right was traded
among copyright professionals, including authors, publishers, producers, broad-
casters, etc. In the past 5 years, it has also been used against end-users—which is
the source of much of the tension—and greatly increased attention paid to copyright
law and policy (Gervais, 2005a, p. 315) in the public eye.

Yet, it is simply wrong to forget that copyright policy has, and always had, a
second side, namely an author’s right to prevent ﬁrst publication and to be iden-
tiﬁed as the author of a work (in appropriate circumstances). That part of copyright
is conveniently attributed to civil law systems and its ‘‘moral right’’, but that is
simply incorrect. True, moral rights include a right of attribution of authorship,48
and civil law systems contain a right of disclosure (divulgation) that allows authors
to prevent ﬁrst publication.49 But the moral right also includes other rights,
including the right to oppose mutilation, whereas the right of attribution of
authorship and the right to oppose ﬁrst publication have been part of the common
law since the 1700s.50

Copyright, even in common law systems, has thus always had a dual nature:
economic and authorial.51 Forgetting this Janus-faced history may explain a
number of signiﬁcant misunderstandings. When realigning copyright to function

better, for example in the internet environment, one should not lose sight that we
are dealing with the ‘‘economic’’ face of the right.52

To quote Dean Garon:

[A]t its core, natural rights protect two aspects of copyright. First is
the Lockean notion that authors are entitled to possess the fruits of
their labours. Second, until divested by ﬁrst publication in exchange
for statutory beneﬁts, authors enjoy sovereignty over their works.
Unfortunately, similar to the analysis of copyright’s intangible nature,
the philosophical framework of natural rights provides little normative
guidance towards the shape of copyright or its continued development
(Garon, 2003, p. 1306).

Copyright is a commercial right, and that is largely a good thing. It has led to
the protection of works that may not have had ‘‘aesthetic merit’’ but that prevented
judges from delving into considerations too close to censorship for comfort. Being
treated as a commercial right has thus allowed a democratization of creativity
following from the abandonment of merit (Ginsburg, 1990a, p. 1890).53 It may also
have made copyright more culturally neutral. But copyright is not only commercial
in nature. First publication, for example,

transcends both the economic issues and the limited risk of premature
access. [The US] Congress recognized how critical the musician’s ﬁrst
exposure could be to the success or failure of the artist. Success in the
marketplace may be economic, associated with the number of copies
sold, or it may be aesthetic, captured in music reviews, critical acclaim,
and professional
reputation within the industry. These aesthetic
successes may someday translate into economics . . . (Ginsburg, 1990b,
p. 1312).

One could think of academics whose pay stub is not (directly) linked to the
number or quality of publications, but for whom attribution may be particularly
important.

This duality is not to be confused with the ‘‘rights holders v user’’ dialogue. Some
have argued that the interests of both groups coincide, while others see it as a
perennial conﬂict. In fact, both views seem to oversimplify greatly, for at least two
reasons. First, in individual cases—as in the many anecdotes used as rhetorical
ammunition to show that copyright ‘‘does not work’’—there may very well be a
conﬂict between a user and a rights holder. Classes of users who are negotiating the
price of a repertory of works, or applying to the Canadian Copyright Board or a
similar body for a tariff, are also in a conﬂict situation. Those conﬂicts are inevitable
in a marketplace, and one does not see why they should magically disappear, given
that the rights apply to intangibles. Second, there is no clear dividing line between
‘‘users’’ and ‘‘rights holders’’. Authors create using other people’s ideas and work.
They also use (consumptively) works of others. Few users never create. At the

bottom, everyone (and not both ‘‘sides’’) should have an interest in making the
copyright system achieve its objectives. User groups who claim ‘‘it should all be free’’
know that their demands are patently unrealistic. The claim by certain rights holders
.who want to lock up content and be paid for every use, whether they have a realistic
expectation of income or not, is similarly unfounded. With this in mind, I suggest a
way to move forward that is within our reach.54

Realigning Copyright with Its Purpose
The Internet
The economic rights’ fragments contained in most national copyright laws are not
particularly useful in mapping out uses of digital works, especially on the internet.55
Copyright fragments have lost their meaning to users and rights holders alike. In
actuality, contracts and licensing arrangements for copyright works do not usually
refer to the speciﬁc rights enumerated in this section, or if they do, it is an
afterthought.56 Contracts typically deﬁne the uses that should be allowed, and
not which fragments of rights are needed.

Simply put, contractual licensing arrangements for some works develop
into an intractable morass of ownership interests and licensing
obligations. . . . works [fall] prey to intricate licensing arrangements,
ownership bankruptcies, and other ﬁssures,
[one could add right
reversions]57 in the chain of copyright title . . . [T]o the extent that
only some authors have the ﬁnancial ability to license these building
blocks [the various rights fragments], the actual and transaction costs of
licensing disproportionately disadvantage those artists without funds
and access to legal services (Garon, 2003, p. 1317).

In the era of the internet, the use of a work (often multi-media) operates in
some respects as a ﬁction vis-a` -vis the Copyright Act (Einhorn and Kurlantzick,
2002, p. 417; Lemley, 1997, pp. 565–6). The rights ‘‘fragments’’ (reproduction,
public performance, communication to the public, rental, display, now making
available, etc.) are a vestige of a haphazard process of rights accretion that
characterizes how the act, and many other national laws and international treaties,
have evolved.58 Part of the resulting problem is that rights are formulated in terms
of the technical nature of the use (copying, performing, etc.), while exceptions are
formulated in terms of purpose (e.g. fair use for criticism, etc.).

Internationally
At the international level, the three-step test (Gervais, 2004b) is the main test to
determine the compatibility of exceptions to copyright with international norms. It
is relevant in this context because that test is not based on the nature of the use, but
rather on the effect of the use. A way to avoid applying copyright where it does not
belong (and where it directly clashes with other rights) is to recast it in terms of the
effects of uses of protected works. I recently suggested (Gervais, 2004a, pp. 13–21)

448

r 2009 The Author. Journal Compilation r 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

A Canadian Copyright Narrative

Daniel J. Gervais

that the best way to achieve this was to start not from the ‘‘rights’’ but with the
exceptions. The reason is simple. Exceptions are designed to determine where
copyright should not go in light of its underlying purpose. If one were to reverse
that test, the universe that would remain would be what, in fact, copyright was
meant to protect. In other words, if one agrees with the premise that fair dealing and
other exceptions reﬂect an appropriate set of criteria to balance the rights of
copyright holders and the needs and interests of users, I suggest it could serve as the
basis to build the copyright of the future (Okediji, 2000, pp. 168–9). Because the
three-step test is the accepted international standard to determine whether an
exception to copyright in national
legislation is Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)-compliant, that solution would
also be in keeping with extant international norms.

What I suggest is reversing the three-step test based on the assumption that what
exceptions (whether fair use in US law or the three-step test at the multilateral level)
do not allow is what copyright intended to protect in the ﬁrst place (Gervais,
2004b). Such an approach is powerful because it both solves the issues related to the
nature-based bundle now used in most national laws and is, by deﬁnition, TRIPS-
compliant. If only uses not allowed by the three-step test are protected (i.e. only
uses allowed under the three-step test are exempted), there can be no violation of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 1886
or TRIPS.

How does one reverse the test? A simple way is to ask: if fair dealing is fair,
then what use is unfair? I submit that ‘‘unfair’’ (i.e. protected) dealing would be use
that does not meet the two real steps of the Berne three-step test, that is, use that
interferes with normal commercial exploitation or unreasonably (unjustiﬁably)
prejudices the copyright holder’s rights. Any use that demonstrably and substantially
reduces ﬁnancial beneﬁts that the copyright owner can reasonably expect to receive
under normal commercial circumstances would be ‘‘unfair’’ without authorization.
How one measures unfairness and interference with normal commercial exploita-
tion in this context is fundamental. I suggest that the question should not be
whether a user got actual or virtual ‘‘value’’ without paying (the property rhetoric)59
but whether the user should have obtained the content through a normal commer-
cial transaction (the economic approach)60.

Three observations are in order, however. First, this clearly applies only to
published content.61 A right to prevent ﬁrst publication must remain. Second, it is
not because a work is unavailable in a given form that taking is ipso facto fair
because no normal commercial transaction is possible. Rights holders must be given
a certain degree of ﬂexibility in how they make works available on various markets
and in various formats. It also means, however, that market practices are relevant.
The question to ask is whether the type of use or user is one that would normally be
licensed (on a transactional or a collective basis). Is the kind of material normally
(only) available on a commercial basis? Finally, it is essential to view normalcy (of
commercial exploitation) as a dynamic notion that is inﬂuenced by technological

development and consumer behaviour. It is clear, in my view, that the internet may
have changed what ‘‘normal commercial exploitation’’ means.

The second step of the Berne test, namely the unreasonable prejudice to
legitimate interests of the rights holder, is one of public interest v author’s rights.
The relevant rights must be those protected under the Act. This is where the
reasoning blends the two steps (without, one hopes, becoming circular). The author
has a right in respect of any commercially signiﬁcant use (use that would normally
be the subject of a commercial transaction) and any situation not covered by this
right would be one that is not subject to normal commercial exploitation and is
justiﬁed by a valid public interest purpose.

In re-scoping the economic component of copyright rights, one should also
distinguish straight commercial uses from transformative uses. One commentator62
has suggested that copyright in its present form does not leave ‘‘enough and as
good’’ and is thus in conﬂict with the Lockean proviso against hoarding. In the
same vein as the fourth factor codiﬁed in section 107 of the US Copyright Act,63 if
one were to adopt a test of commercial signiﬁcance, derivative/transformative uses
would be free to the extent that they did not demonstrably affect the market for the
original work. There would be a logical presumption that a simple, non-transfor-
mative adaptation (change of medium), although it requires signiﬁcant creative
input (e.g. translation, making a ﬁlm out of a novel), does have that signiﬁcant
impact. In addition, the authorial side of the copyright coin requires that the author
of the original work be involved. But uses such as parodies would be fair game.64
Commercial uses (or perhaps more accurately uses on a commercially relevant
scale) would also be the subject of an exclusive right. But there would be no need for
private use65 or fair-dealing provisions. Fair uses would be those that meet the
three-step test, and uses beyond that would require an authorization.

This suggested approach is not revolutionary. On the contrary, it is solidly and
realistically anchored in the historical purpose of copyright. It is also in line with
international norms, which this author sees as a key factor in any decision that a
World Trade Organization (WTO) member may make to improve its copyright
system. It is not a public interest sieve for copyright infringements, but I suggest
that excluding non-commercially relevant uses from the economic copyright rights
would greatly reduce the harm that, according to ‘‘public interest’’ advocates, the
copyright system is causing.

The Trade Connection
There is progressive alignment of trade and intellectual property policy. It started
in the United States in the 1980s (Sell, 2003)66 (notably through section 301 of
the Trade Act67) and culminated in the 1994 WTO TRIPS.68 This has at least two
important consequences. First, trade law is pragmatic, something illustrated by
the fuzzy notion under WTO law of ‘‘nulliﬁcation or impairment’’ of beneﬁts or the
doctrine of ‘‘reasonable expectations’’. Second, trade remedies are generally pre-
dicated on a showing of adverse impact on trade, and the protection of intellectual

property by trade rules does not seem to mesh with its ideological defence as a
‘‘property’’ right.69 On the contrary, the linkage with trade seems to reinforce the
instrumentalist/consequentialist approach to intellectual property regulation.

The United States may need to pick which legal horse it wants to cross
the copyright infringement river: if it chooses trade, it must accept pragmatism and
the related, three-step test-compatible need to show loss of reasonably available
income streams. From that viewpoint, its recent rhetorical reliance on property
may thus be at odds with a strategy that was otherwise highly successful by US
copyright and patent lobbies to link intellectual property and trade (Gervais,
2005d).

The admixture of trade rules and intellectual property norms was neither easy
nor obvious. Until the establishment of the WTO and the entry into force of TRIPS
in 1995,
intellectual property was an exception to free trade rules (General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], article XX(d); Gervais, 2003, pp. 5–9).
But if the mix is now accepted as a given (Bhagwati, 2004), then one must accept the
consequences of that choice.

Article 9 of TRIPS in April 1994 (see Gervais, 2003, pp. 12–26) incorporates
most substantive provisions of the Berne Convention into TRIPS,70 although it also
states that WTO ‘‘[m]embers shall not have rights or obligations under this
Agreement in respect of the rights conferred under article 6bis of that Convention
or of the rights derived therefrom’’.71 In other words, the moral right to claim
authorship (or to remain anonymous) and the right to ‘‘object to any distortion,
mutilation or other modiﬁcation of, or other derogatory action in relation to [a
protected] work, which would be prejudicial to [the author’s] honour or reputation’’
is excluded from TRIPS. By excluding moral rights TRIPS arguably split the
copyright coin. If one eschews the rather simplistic view of the moral right (as
implemented in common law jurisdictions) as a foreign, continental, Kantian
concept imposed on reluctant countries, but rather as one that has been part of
common law copyright—at least with respect to the right to claim authorship and
the right to prevent ﬁrst publication, which may conceptually be linked to a
reputation-based right such as the right to oppose a mutilation of a creative
work—then by removing the non-purely economic component from its normative
framework, TRIPS may have weakened the intrinsic equilibrium of copyright and,
hence, the ‘‘power to convince’’ that copyright has traditionally enjoyed. It may
have become a pure statutory entitlement among many others, one designed to
allow for limited market control (Gervais, 2005a; 2005b; 2005c; 2005d, pp. 1–37).
While this desire to maximize proﬁt and control protected works may be
entirely legitimate—and a fair exercise of the copyright industries’ duties to their
shareholders—the policy debate has become not one of fairness to authors but
rather of how much money it is fair for those companies (not authors) to make. This
may explain part of the resistance of various user groups and insistence that ‘‘CDs
and DVDs are too expensive’’ and the related, if generally intuitive, perception that
copyright works are public goods.72 As Jon Garon noted:

[t]he format of the digital ﬁle results in a conﬂation of ideas, information,
and the copyrighted expression, as the ‘‘computer ﬁle’’ becomes the
unitary metaphor for all three attributes of the work. The ﬁle metaphor
and the unlimited copying combine to transform all copyrighted works
into public goods . . .To put the ﬁnal nail in the copyright cofﬁn, the
anonymity and international scope of the Internet has raised questions
about whether legal constraints can serve any meaningful role on the
Internet (Gervais, 2005a; 2005b; 2005c; 2005d, p. 1336; see also Gervais,
2004c).

By staking their copyright claim in the soil of trade, natural rights-based
views—and with them many of the perceived fairness—of copyright are no longer
convincing. For user groups and developing countries implementing TRIPS and
TRIPS-Plus rules (Ostergard Jr., 2002, pp. 505–35), it has become a numbers game,
that is, not one where players can defend a position strictly based on the proper-
tization of creative works.

Property confers advantages by ensuring investment and development of
resources. The social costs of excludability are acceptable because ‘‘the losses that
people suffer from exclusion are small compared to the gains that they get both
from their ability to privatize their labour and from their ability to enter into trade
. . .’’ (Epstein, 2004, p. 22). In other words, the main propertization is a clear Pareto
improvement, but copyright may be different. In classic property theory, for
instance, possession is considered key and the law essentially reinforces the physical
control that can be exerted by the owner (by fencing, etc.). No such metes and
bounds exist in copyright law. This probably explains why property rights in
intangibles have been the subject of many a scholarly debate. The non-rivalrous,
non-excludable nature of intangibles73 and the (perceived) public good nature
(Alﬁno, 1991) of at least some copyright works have already weakened the property
discourse (see Hettinger, 1989, pp. 35–8; Landes and Posner, 2003).74

Ethics no longer guide us in a context of aggressive commercial exploitation,
and ‘‘because of the breakdown of traditional social structure or matrix of social
practices within which ethical questions have either been resolved or lack a
motivation’’ (Alﬁno, 1991, p. 10). In fact, social norms may be moving away
from the industry control rhetoric and may give rise to other compensation
models (Gervais, 2004c) and it is not insigniﬁcant to note that surveys show that
stealing a physical object such as a CD is generally considered theft, while
downloading music from peer-to-peer networks is not.75 The tangible nature of
the good matters, even though its value depends entirely on the non-tangible
component (i.e. the music). The social norms do not reﬂect an understanding as
downloading as malum in se, as a natural rights justiﬁcation would suggest, but
rather as an (annoying) malum prohibitum, and a prohibition that should be
revisited (if not the norm itself then the way it is used and enforced). The lower
level of internalization of the rule means that a higher degree of technical control

or legal enforcement is required, that is, exactly what can be observed in the
marketplace.

The trade link and the pragmatic nature of trade rules, and their enforcement in
the GATT/WTO context (Jackson, 1997), have forced copyright holders to ﬁnd a
new exposition of the principles according to which their investment should be
protected, under what circumstances and to what extent. Term, scope (or rights and
exceptions) and rights management are all on the Holmesian table76 set by the
incorporation of copyright in trade. ‘‘This is the age of the ﬁnance minister. . . . The
game of nations is now geo-monopoly’’ (Thomas L. Friedman, quoted in Jackson,
1997, p. 4).77 Copyright policy is not, or no longer, an exception. Whether that was
for the best remains to be seen.

Conclusion

The Canadian copyright systems were imported, or at least inspired by, elements of
UK law and the complex and at times obscure British history of copyright, which
was born out of the ashes of a censorship-tainted licensing system guaranteeing a
monopoly to members of the Stationers’ Company. The transition from a publish-
er’s right to an author-centric concept happened in the years that preceded the
adoption of the Statute of Anne. To a certain extent, authors were instrumentalized
to secure rights for publishers as assigns of authors. Common law copyright was
then essentially limited to unpublished works and the right to be recognized as the
author of a published work.

In the United States, for purposes of interpreting Constitutional and other
eighteenth-century law, considering contemporary legal practices that the Framers
would be familiar with is useful (to understand their context and what they would
have been reacting against). In that context, British copyright history is also
relevant from a US perspective. Yet US courts recognized the difﬁculty of referring
to UK copyright principles or history because it is far from crystalline. In addition,
given the United States’ Revolutionary history, US courts were free to supply a
narrative of their own, through thinkers such as Jefferson and Madison. And, to a
certain extent they did. US law weaves utilitarian/instrumentalist (essentially the
‘‘incentive’’ theory) and natural rights and fairness elements. It seems, however, that
in the late 1990s, that narrative was shelved and that a simpler, property-centric
rhetoric was preferred, even though copyright’s entry in the ‘‘property’’ family was
a difﬁcult adoption at best.

Now may be the time to adopt a different approach, one that is conscious of
principles and objectives. Rather than appeasing the maximum number of lobbies,
legislators should focus on the adoption of a Canadian narrative, using the recent
Supreme Court dicta as guidance. The practice of developing detailed rules built on
an absence of foundations should be jettisoned. This article suggested a view that
reconciled the economic and authorial aspects of copyright and proposed a new
copyright norm aimed at commercially signiﬁcant uses.

1 See Garon (2003):

Beginning in 1709, England singled out intellectual property from other
areas of law, distinctly from the other forms of labor. The United States and
even France took similar approaches. The underlying basis was a recognition
that intellectual enterprise serves the public in a manner fundamentally
different from other forms of labor, and thus needs to be clothed with
sufﬁcient reward for the most capable to serve society in this capacity.

2 As a point of reference, Caxton introduced the printing press into England in 1476,

26 years after its invention by Gutenberg.

3 James I also issued ‘‘printing patents’’, in the same form as letters patent concerning

‘‘inventions’’ to certain publishers, but most were issued to company members. But
those patents were limited in time and thus much less important than the unlimited
stationers’ ‘‘copyright’’. The censorship element was reinforced by various decrees of the
Star Chamber issued in 1566, 1586 and 1637 (see Patterson, 1968, p. 6).

4 See his Areopagitica, published in 1644.
5 In particular, at p. 454:

The various eighteen-century editors and writers who attacked Simmons
. . . and booksellers generally were plainly appropriating Milton in their
own struggle for respectability (and cash), a struggle they viewed
themselves as carrying on in part with their needed representatives in
the marketplace.

6 The attribution of this to Newton as the ﬁrst to use this phrase may be erroneous. See
Merton (1993). Merton traced the aphorism to Bernard de Chartres (twelfth century).
7 In a letter to a member of Parliament, B. Rand, Correspondence of John Locke and

Edward Clarke, at 39 (original 1927, reprint 1975), he wrote:

By this monopoly also of those ancient authors, nobody here, that would
publish any of them anew with comments, or any other advantage, can do
it without the leave of the learned, judicious stationers. For if they will not
print it themselves nor let any other, by your labour about it never so
useful, and you have permission to print it from the Archbishop and all
the other licencers, it is to no purpose. If the company of stationers so
please it must not be printed. An instance you have of this in Æsop’s
Fables. Pray talk with A. Churchill concerning this who I believe will be
able to show you other great inconveniences of that act, and if they can
possibly, I wish they could be remedied. And particularly, I think, that
clause, where printing and importation of any books, to which any have a
right by patent is prohibited, should be at least thus far restrained that it
should be lawful for anyone to print or import any Latin book whose
author lived above a thousand years since.

8 It is the source of fascinating and continuing academic debates. See Epstein (2004) and

Bell (2001, pp. 762–3):

That facially plausible extension of Locke’s theory does not, however,
withstand close scrutiny. His labor-desert justiﬁcation of property gives an
author clear title only to the particular tangible copy in which she ﬁxes her
expression—not to some intangible plat in the noumenal realm of ideas.
Locke himself did not
try to justify intangible property. Modern
commentators who would venture so far beyond the boundaries of
Locke’s thought and into the abstractions of intellectual property thus
ought to leave his name behind.

9 A second term of 14 years was possible if the author was still alive.

10 See Patterson (1968, p. 169). As Jon Garon noted:

Transfer of the copyright allowed the parties to effect by two steps what
had been prohibited by one [namely the stationers’ monopoly]. Had the
House of Lords come to an opposite conclusion in Donaldson [see infra],
the practical result would have been to re-establish the Stationers’
Company Act (Garon, 2003, p. 1298).

11 As Professor Bently cautioned:

. . . it is often said that a natural-rights-based justiﬁcation for copyright
inevitably produces a different conception of copyright than is produced
by an incentive argument. More speciﬁcally, it is argued that a natural
rights conception of copyright leads to longer and stronger protection for
authors (and copyright owners) than an incentive based conception. This
is because a natural rights argument for copyright is assumed to result in a
form of property that is perpetual and unqualiﬁed. In contrast, an
incentive-based argument only justiﬁes the grant of the minimum level
of protection necessary to induce the right-holder to create and release the
work. . . . While it is understandable that lobby groups use (or abuse) the
various justiﬁcations to further their ends, more problems arise when
people begin to believe the rhetoric . . . (Bentley and Sherman, 2001,
pp. 33–4).

12 Michel Foucault (1979) commented that the modern concept of author ‘‘constitutes

a privileged moment of individualism in the history of ideas’’ (p. 141; see also Jaszi,
1992).

13 Professor Hughes commented on this point recently:

Our modern word ‘‘propriety’’ comes from the Middle English word
‘‘propriete’’, which comes from the Old French word ‘‘propri ´et ´e,’’ which
means—in old and modern French—both ‘‘property’’ and ‘‘correctness’’
or ‘‘suitability’’ (Hughes, 2006, p. 1011).

14 William Enﬁeld (1774) explained it as follows: ‘‘Labour gives a man a natural right of

property in that in which he produces: literary compositions are the effect of labour;
authors have therefore a natural right of property in their works’’ (p. 85).

15 See Millar v Kinkaid (1750), 4 Burr. 2,319, 98 ER 210.
16 Pope v Curll (1741) 1 Ark. 341.
17 ER 26:608.
18 To demonstrate further the importance of British copyright history in US (state)
common law copyright, one could cite section 985 of the California Civil Code, which
is directly inspired by Pope v Curll. It provides as follows:

Letters and other private communications in writing belong to the person
to whom they are addressed and delivered; but they cannot be published
against the will of the writer, except by authority of law.

It is fairly apparent that the writer’s right to prohibit is not a property right.

19 As also noted by Prof. Patterson, several orders of the Court of Assistants made it

clear that the stationers had to show they had the author’s consent. See Patterson,
1968, p. 69. However, authors themselves could not copyright. With respect to
published works, it was a publisher right only until the Statute of 1709. See ibid., p. 5.

22 In fact, the case was dismissed for collusion between the parties. Apparently, a pact had
been made to get the court to recognize the author’s perpetual common law right. See

26 Ibid., 256. I digress for a minute to note that property-based narratives are very

appealing nowadays of course, especially in the United States, because they conform
to and support the classical (‘‘liberal’’) discourse about priority of the individual and the
sanctity of property. See Rose (1993, p. 85). In the United States, property is also a
policy ‘‘given’’ because it is constitutionally protected.

27 (1774) 2 Bro. P.C. 129; 4 Burr. 2408.
28 As Professor Alﬁno also noted:

Blackstone asserted an analogy between intellectual property and real
property over which one has a right of occupation. If Blackstone is right
then public access to copyrighted works is not a public right but a kind of
visitation right. Copyright infringement is thus not so much theft as
trespassing.

29 If it ever was. Authorial advocates were fully aware of Kantian and natural rights
justiﬁcations used on the Continent, as is apparent in Defoe’s writings, among others.
30 Including both bilateral treaties and the Berne Convention of 1886 (see infra n. 70). See

Sherman (1995, pp. 8–12).

31 To use Telidon, a technology many Canadians would not be able to identify, as

the other end of a chain that began with the invention of the printing press was a
stretch.

32 Carys Craig has argued that Lockean theory (essentially the protection of one’s labour
in transformation of things found in nature, while leaving enough for others) underpins
several judicial decisions in Canada in her comments about the purpose of copyright law
in Canada:

Scholarly writing in the area of copyright law frequently lends weight to
the natural rights approach to copyright law. As is the case with judicial
pronouncements, scholarly appeal to Locke’s acquisition theory is often
implicit, simply taking the author’s right to own as the foundational
assumption. Particularly interesting, however, is the relative frequency
with which academic literature directly invokes Lockean labour theory as
axiomatic in the copyright realm. This body of literature, whether
ultimately supporting or refuting a Lockean justiﬁcation for copyright,
is evidence in itself of the powerful grip of his theory over the legal
imagination in this area. Indeed, Locke’s labour theory is so commonly
invoked in examinations of copyright doctrine that one might be forgiven
for believing that he explicitly defended intellectual property rights, or for
that matter, that copyright legislation explicitly afﬁrmed Lockean theory
(footnote omitted) (Craig, 2002, p. 21).

33 Although it has been said that while ‘‘copyright claims to own information on the basis
of labour per se have not been accepted in the USA, decisions in Canada, and Australia
have been more receptive to such claims’’ (Fitzgerald, 2003, p. 181).

35 Th ´eberge, paragraphs 30–33.
36 And, as Jagdish Bhagwati noted: ‘‘. . . economists use cost–beneﬁt analysis, which means

. . . a utilitarian form of analysis instead of a [property] rights based approach’’ (see
Bhagwati, 2004, p. 183).

37 There would be an ontological debate worth having: is copyright a restriction on the

otherwise free use of ideas (in which case a right to use is the default) or is copyright
starting from a principle of protection/restriction and then one can argue that it should
be inherently balanced?

38 A detailed case comment on CCH was previously published by this author. See Gervais,

‘‘Canadian Copyright Law Post-CCH’’.

39 University of London Press v University Tutorial Press, [1916] 2 Ch 601. Actually, one
would be foolhardy to attempt to provide a single deﬁnition of originality in UK law in
light of recent decisions. For a brief discussion, see Bently and Sherman (2001, pp.
80–98), and for international aspects, see Gervais (2004a).

40 CCH, paragraph 51.
41 I use the terminology somewhat loosely here. It may be useful to add that utilitarianism
is consequentialist (goals-oriented): intellectual property is a good thing because ‘‘good’’
(new creations and inventions) stems from it. Utilitarianism is a form of collective
consequentialism, where the ‘‘good’’ results are assessed at the level of the general
welfare.

42 The concept of utilitarianism deals with the maximization of good to society. It is linked to
the writings of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Instrumentalism assesses actions in
relation to their objective. Thus, actions are tools to achieve certain goals. The
instrumentalist utilitarianism view is to see law as an instrument to achieve the greatest
good for society. Thus, intellectual property is useful because it encourages creativity
and encourages people to share their creations with others, thus beneﬁting society as a
whole.

producers, broadcasters) or illegitimate ones (e.g. resellers of pirated CDs or DVDs).

46 See Keith Aoki, who notes that:

[I] laid out the theme of the disaggregation of a unitary vision of ‘‘property’’
in twentieth century United States law and introduced the relative
countermovement in United States copyright law toward hardening and
expanding intellectual property owners’ rights. This movement is doubly
ironic because even in the heyday of absolutist notions of ‘‘private property’’,
copyrights were an exception: They were limited rights promulgated

pursuant to public regulation, a mapping that is obscured when viewed
through the occluding lens of romantic authorship (Hale, 1923, p. 470).

47 Congress did, at one time at least, seem to agree:

In enacting a copyright law Congress must consider . . . two questions:
First, how much will the legislation stimulate the producer and so beneﬁt
the public, and, second, how much will the monopoly granted be
detrimental to the public? The granting of such exclusive rights, under
the proper terms and conditions, confers a beneﬁt upon the public that
outweighs the evils of the temporary monopoly. HRRep. No. 2222, 60th
Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1909).

Quoted in Sony Corp. of America v Universal City Studios Inc., 464 US 417, 430
(1984).

48 See article 6bis of the Berne Convention (see infra n. 70) and Lucas and Lucas (2001,

pp. 302–34).

49 Ibid.
50 There is no room in this article for this discussion, but it is also interesting to note that
the emergence of the ‘‘author’’ is neither culturally nor politically neutral. As Professor
Coombe noted:

Beyond the obvious—that the author emerges along with the ascendancy
of the European bourgeoisie, rising literacy, the decline of aristocratic
patronage, and the growing hegemony of market exchange economies—it
should be noted that the author/work conﬁguration was central to the
functioning of the ‘‘bourgeois public sphere’’ which (as Habermas and
others have argued) was organized through the medium of print around
activities of readership. Such activities presupposed an ‘‘author’’ whose
‘‘work’’ was the intentional ‘‘expression’’ of a uniﬁed self addressing other
rational selves capable of reading and evaluating such works to debate the
ideas contained therein—to the ends of generating public dialogue to
inﬂuence public goals. The constitutive exclusionary elitism of this model
aside, it is worth stressing here that the author’s control was limited to the
work (in contemporary vocabulary, as an ‘‘incentive’’ to disseminate it
socially, so that the ideas and information it ‘‘contained’’ would be
available for the greater political good of public dialogue) (footnotes
omitted) (Coombe, 1996, p. 1359).

This explains some of the difﬁculties in applying copyright concepts to different cultural
contexts, such as traditional cultural expressions of indigenous peoples. See also Gervais
(2005b).

51 For lack of a better term. As James Boyle noted, referring to the ‘‘romantic’’ view of

authorship:

The writer does not write [only] for money, nor is she interested in
anything other than the perfection of her work. The author is presumed
to have an almost transcendental insight—something which cuts beneath

the mundane world of everyday appearance. This transcendental right or
genius plays a very important role in establishing the author as the ruler of
the text (Boyle, 1988, p. 629).

Peter Jaszi also commented in that connection that ‘‘far from being a non-controversial,
generalized ‘‘source’’ of copyright doctrine, [authorship] in fact is the speciﬁc locus of a
basic contradiction between public access to and private control over imaginative
creations’’ (Jaszi, 1991, p. 457).

52 Obviously, the non-economic side, which I would call the authorial rights side, may have

economic impacts.

53 Ginsburg notes, in reference to Bleistein v Donaldson Lithographic Co. 188 US 239 (1903)
that ‘‘the receptivity of copyright to both creativity and commercial value’’, had allowed
US courts to protect works that lack aesthetic merit.

54 For smaller scale proposals, such as facilitating rights management, see Gervais (2005c).
55 See Einhorn and Kurlantzick (2002, p. 417): ‘‘Since these rights are controlled by
different parties and agents, the complexity of the system leads to a gridlock of control
that may hinder development’’.

56 A contract to allow web-casting normally refers to the function of broadcasting,
independently of whether a communication to the public, one or more reproductions,
or adaptations may take place. The problem is that rights ownership is still by and large,
especially in the area of collective management, owned by different entities based on the
rights, not the functions. While a single economic transaction should take place, several
legal transactions are involved. See Kohn (2000, pp. 398–9).

57 Under the national

laws of several countries, rights revert to the author’s heirs

independently of any contractual transfer. Under section 14(1) of the Canadian Act,
reversion occurs 25 years after the author’s death.

58 See WIPO, Berne Convention Centenary 1886–1986, loc cit.
59 As Professor Alﬁno (1991) noted: ‘‘. . . policy arguments which proceed primarily by a
retrieval of abstract thought on the metaphysical principles of property are inadequate’’.
60 See United-States—section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act, WTO Document WT/

DS160/R, 15 June 2000, paragraph 6.225.

61 A right of ‘‘ﬁrst publication’’, well rooted in UK law, exists in most national laws. In the
United States, fair use of unpublished material has been limited by a number of court
decisions. See O’Neill (2001, p. 369).

62

. . . copyright principles that accord property ownership to a labourer
where his labour is sufﬁciently separate from the ‘‘parent idea’’ and
awards ownership to the owner of the ‘‘parent idea’’ where the new
work bears too much resemblance to the original. The person who truly
has something to ‘‘add’’ to the cultural discourse (as opposed to merely
reproducing another’s prior contribution) will beneﬁt from the same rules
of acquisition as the ﬁrst labourer. It is true that if the defendant’s work is
not substantially similar to the plaintiff’s copyrighted work, there is no
infringement of the copyright. However, where a defendant’s work is, as a
result of copying, substantially similar to the plaintiff’s, prima facie
infringement will be established regardless of
the ‘‘labour added’’.
The question we ask in a copyright infringement action is whether the

defendant’s work is substantially similar to a ‘‘substantial part’’ of the
plaintiff’s work, rather than whether the work taken from the plaintiff
constitutes a substantial part of the defendant’s work.
. . . As noted
by Judge Learned Hand, ‘‘no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by show-
ing how much of his work he did not pirate’’ (in Sheldon v. Metro-
Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F.2d 49 at 56 (2d Cir, 1936)) (Craig, 2002, pp.
26–8).

63 17 USC. It reads in part as follows:

reporting,

. . . the fair use of a copyrighted work, . . . for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news
for
classroom use), scholarship, or research,
is not an infringement of
copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

teaching (including multiple copies

. . .

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work.

64 This may be the most difﬁcult issue in copyright law, namely the border between

protected ‘‘expression’’ and unprotected ‘‘ideas’’ (see TRIPS, article 9(2)). To what
extent should copyright be a right in the form or Gestalt and not in the thoughts, tastes
and passions that generated the ‘‘work’’? The question can be tackled from several
angles. To what extent is copyright protection applicable only to the objectiﬁed work,
not to the subjective fuel used to create it? What is the point of inﬂexion past which
protection against the creation of derivatives imposes too high a social welfare cost on
other creators? What is the proper level of abstraction of copyright law, or should it be
formulated as the protection of the concrete and speciﬁc forms of literary and artistic
expression (at a ﬁner degree, each ‘‘category’’ of protected works is itself subject to
abstraction)? See Sherman (1995, pp. 15–22). It is also harder to measure the exact input
of incremental authors. As Hettinger aptly noted:

A person who relies on human intellectual history and makes small
modiﬁcation to produce something of great value should no more
receive what the market will bear than should the last person needed to
lift a car receive full credit for lifting it. (Hettinger, 1989, p. 38)

Yet because copyright law does not distinguish between ‘‘minor’’ incremental works and
those that result from a major creative effort, it is up to courts to modulate the level of
protection. It can also be said (using Saussurean structuralist terminology) that copyright
protects the signiﬁer, not the signiﬁed (the idea/expression dichotomy), and if one posits
that ideas are more valuable than a particular expression thereof, then copyright’s
inherent limits are good for human progress and the public domain. This was lamented by
T.H. Farrer in 1882:

Original thought and observation, the highest form of mental labour, go
unprotected, whilst literary manufacture, a very inferior product of the

rights component only—as well as rights under article IV(3) of the appendix (Gervais,
2003, p. 125).

72 There is, for example, long-recognized social value in proving access to information. As

Jon Garon has pointed out, however, copyright works are not true public goods (i.e.
non-exclusive and non-rivalrous, such as air, sea and free-ﬂowing water) even though
some of their delivery mechanisms are (e.g. over-the-air television and, arguably, the
internet) (Garon, 2003, pp. 1333–5).

73 Use is non-excludable, but proﬁt making through distribution of a work (see Gervais

and Judge, 2005, pp. 2–3).

74 A number of scholars, such as Professor Richard Epstein, have argued that the gulf
between property rights in tangibles and property rights in intangibles is narrower than
may appear at ﬁrst glance. By the same token, they recognize that the difference in the
nature of the resource requires a distinctive conﬁguration of the property rights in
question, one with limited duration and free or fair use exceptions to minimize negative
social welfare impacts. Epstein suggests that adopting a more consequentialist analytical
grid may be Ariadne’s thread out of the justiﬁcatory labyrinth.

The assumption that people are justiﬁed in defending what they have
become accustomed to is obviously an assumption heavily biased toward
the status quo. There will naturally be people who want to change the way
things are, but on Holmes’s theory, these people are simply attempting to
shift some part of the aggregate social burden from one set of shoulders to
another. ‘‘Justice’’ and ‘‘fairness’’ are slogans propping up particular

struggles, not eternal principles, and reform is a zero-sum game. But if we
ﬂip Holmes’s theory over onto its back, so to speak, the implications are
reversed. For the friends of the status quo have no grater claim to the
principles of justice and fairness than its enemies do (Menand, 2002,
pp. 63–4).

77 At least one other well-known economist is not convinced about the merits of the linkage

and even sees threats to the integrity of the trading system:

For virtually the ﬁrst time, the corporate lobbies in pharmaceutical and
software had distorted and deformed an important multilateral
institution, turning it away from its trade mission and rationale and
transforming it into a royalty collection agency. The consequences have
been momentous, Now every lobby in the rich countries wants to put its
own agenda, almost always trade-unrelated, into the WTO (Bhagwati,
2004, p. 183).

One could reply that the United States is progressively abandoning the multilateral
approach and uses its substantial clout to get deals on a bilateral or a regional basis, in
many of which dispute settlement is often mostly irrelevant because the United States is
both the net importer and by far the bigger player and thus much less sensitive to
‘‘retaliation’’. As it has done with a number of WTO and NAFTA decisions, the United
States can thus ‘‘realpolitikally’’ ignore negative rulings while insisting on enforcement
of those it wins (see, e.g., Owens, 2003, pp. 49–54).
