Initial interest confusion
Ilanah Simon Fhima*

Under the traditional model of trade mark law, the
purchasing choices of consumers are altered by an
erroneous belief at the point of sale that the goods or
services in question were made by, or under the
authority of, the trade mark owner. However, in recent
decisions, notably that of Arnold J in Och-Ziff,1 it has
been suggested that initial interest confusion, where the
wrongful belief is corrected prior to the sale taking
place, is actionable. This article seeks to examine the
extent to which trade mark owners can rely on initial
interest confusion in registered trade mark cases, the
extent to which initial interest confusion ﬁts within the
general
scheme of European trade mark law and
whether this form of action really does constitute a
novel development, or if instead it is already inherent
in the trade mark system.

The emergence of initial interest
confusion
Initial
interest confusion has gained some notoriety
following Arnold J’s decision in Och-Ziff. The senior
user owned Community trade marks for OCH-ZIFF
and OCH, which it used for fund management services.
The junior user, established by a Mr Ochocki, offered
ﬁnancial services under the name OCH CAPTIAL. The
signs and the services were both similar, but the junior
user argued that the nature of the services was such
than any confusion would be dispelled by the time that
a potential client entered into a contract with the
junior user (consumers of fund management services
pay careful attention the nature of their investment).
This was accepted by Arnold J.2 However, he found
that it was no bar to a ﬁnding of infringement under
Article 9(1)(b) of the Community Trade Mark (CTM)
Regulation because that Article extends to cover initial
interest confusion. After giving an account of its ac-
ceptance in the United States, he deﬁned initial interest
confusion in the European context as

† Traditionally,

trade mark law in the United
Kingdom has focused on confusion which occurs
at the time of sale. However, in a number of
recent decisions, most notably, Och-Ziff, it has
been suggested that pre-sale or initial
interest
confusion may be actionable under registered
trade mark law.
† Although initial

interest confusion has had a
recent ‘moment in the limelight’, there is author-
ity to support its recognition dating back at least
a decade. However, one of the main obstacles to
the recognition of initial
interest confusion is
identifying the damage involved. This has caused
particular difﬁculties in relation to passing off,
which has been the subject of a previous article
in this journal (see B Allgrove and P O’Byrne,
‘Pre-sale misrepresentations in passing off: an
idea whose time has come or unfair competition
by the back door?’ (2006) 1 JIPLP 413). The
extent to which initial
interest confusion can
cause damage and whether damage is indeed
needed for the confusion element of registered
trade mark infringement is considered in this
context.

† Recognition of

initial

interest confusion has a
number of potential applications in both the
online and ofﬂine world. However, it is argued
that judging the merits of initial interest confu-
sion in isolation is too limiting. Instead, any form
of ‘operative confusion’, ie which has an effect on
how consumers behave, should be actionable.

confusion on the part of the public as to the trade origin
of the goods or services in relation to which the impugned
sign has been used arising from use of the sign prior to
purchase of those goods or services, and in particular
confusion arising from use of the sign in advertising or
promotional materials.

He found that both the Court of Justice of the Euro-
pean Union’s (CJEU) case law and that of the UK
courts supported the idea that initial interest confusion
was actionable.3 He also accepted the senior user’s
argument that confusion prior to purchase was still
confusion and could still damage the trade mark owner
or advantage the junior user, even if it was remedied
before any sale took place and, consequently, there was
no diversion of
trade. Such damage could include
harm to the reputation of the senior goods and erosion
of the distinctiveness of the senior mark.4 Moreover,
Article 9(2) of the CTM Regulation made it clear that
infringement could take place without a sale, particu-
larly via junior advertising.5

Initial interest confusion had been considered prior
to Och-Ziff, at least in passing, by courts in the UK,
though not by the CJEU. When L’Ore´al v Bellure was
before the High Court in 2006, Lewison J noted that
counsel for the senior user had raised the issue, but
curtly dismissed it, because it was not mentioned in
the oral argument and, in any event,
‘there was not
a shred of evidence to support it’.6 A more generous
approach was taken at ﬁrst instance in Whirlpool v
Kenwood, a case concerning the product shape of two
competing food mixers. Although the Deputy Judge
found that consumers would merely associate the two
shapes
interest
confusion, he appears to have been open to the idea of
initial interest confusion being actionable in the right
circumstances.7

Following Och-Ziff, initial interest confusion played
a key role in Fine & Country Limited.8 Both parties
were estate agents. The senior user, which operated
at the premium end of the property market, traded
as FINE & COUNTRY. The junior user, which had

previously only traded at the lower end of the property
market as HAART, rebranded part of its business as
FINE, which it used in conjunction with the strapline
‘selling ﬁne homes throughout the country’. Its aim was
to penetrate the premium end of the market. Amongst
the senior user’s witnesses was a Mrs Wilshere. She ﬁrst
sought to sell her property in 2010. She arranged a
valuation with the junior user, thinking it to be the
senior user. However, her husband objected to using
the ‘posh end of Haart’ and so the valuation was can-
celled and a different agent was instructed, unsuccess-
fully. In attempting to sell the property a second time,
she contacted the senior user, but explained that she
was reluctant to use the ‘posh end of Haart’. Although
the senior user’s employee explained that
the two
businesses were unconnected, Hildyard J accepted that
this amounted to misrepresentation for the purposes of
passing off and confusion under registered trade mark
law. While Mrs Wilshere’s confusion was temporary,
and did not ultimately affect her economic decisions, it
suggested that ‘sensible people’ could be confused in a
way that stopped them from dealing with the senior
user. Additionally, the nature of the business was such
that, even if consumers realized that they were not
dealing with the agent with which they had originally
intended to deal,
realization may only have
dawned ‘at a time when inertia may discourage chan-
ging in mid-stream’.9 An example of this could be seen
in the behaviour of another witness, a Ms Appleby,
who instructed the junior user thinking it to be ‘a mod-
ernized rebranding’ of the senior user. Although she
realized her mistake before the end of the contract
of instruction, she decided not to withdraw from the
contract until it had run its course, though the property
was not ultimately sold during this period.10

that

This case exempliﬁes two potential problems arising
from initial
interest confusion: potential damage to
reputation and loss of sales, even when the confusion is
corrected before the point of sale. The case is also inter-
esting because there are two points in time which
could be viewed as the point at which there was a
diversion of trade or at which the confusion affected

the economic behaviour of consumers: the point at
which vendors entered into a contract of instruction or
the point at which the sale of the property took place.
Money would only be diverted at the latter point.
Indeed, there are many everyday situations where the
consumer is ‘locked in’ to a transaction before paying
for his services. For example, a person who orders food
at a restaurant may cease to be confused after placing
the order but before receiving his bill or, to take the
example from Du Cross v Gold (mentioned below), a
person riding in a cab may realize his error before
being told the ﬁnal price on reaching his destination.
Such cases may strictly be considered pre-sale or initial
interest confusion, although the consumer was con-
fused at the time of entering the transaction that locks
him in to an expectation of payment, which will most
likely result in a lost sale, save in the case of the most
bellicose of consumers.

A further post-Och-Ziff example of the acceptance of
initial interest confusion, in principle at least, is Ghias
t/a Griller.11 The senior user owned two word-and-
device marks containing the word GRILLER for res-
taurant services. Those marks formed the basis of a
franchise fast-food business. The junior user operated a
fast-food restaurant under the name GRILLER KING
and used a logo including that wording. In considering
confusion under s 10(2) of the Trade Marks Act, Miss
Recorder Michaels noted a letter written to the senior
user by one of its regular customers who had come
across GRILLER KING and had entered, assuming it to
be a branch of the senior user’s franchise. After asking
why his meal was cheaper than at his usual branch,
he was told it was a special promotion for a new
GRILLER branch. He subsequently wrote to the senior
user, querying the inferior quality of the food and the
difference in price. Miss Recorder Michaels found that
the letter suggested that there had been ‘at least initial
interest confusion’, though it is hard to understand why
this is classiﬁed as initial interest rather than point of
sale confusion since, after having been given wrong in-
formation about the reason for the price difference, the
letter writer appears to have gone on to buy a meal
under that misapprehension (how else would he know
about the quality of the food?). However, this evidence,
and the s 10(2) case, were ultimately dismissed for lack
of a statement of truth and lack of information about
the extent to which the writer was confused.

12 BP Amoco Plc v John Kelly Ltd [2002] FSR 5, para 63.

The ‘outrider’ in recognizing initial interest confu-
sion as an actionable form of confusion under regis-
tered trade mark law came a full decade before Och-Ziff
in BP v Kelly.12 The senior user owned a trade mark for
the colour green as applied to the exterior surface of its
service stations of services in Class 37. The colour
alone was unlikely to be used on service stations and,
by the time that any consumer was ready to purchase
petrol, he would have noticed the junior user’s name
and/or logo on the station. However, the Court of
Appeal of Northern Ireland found that there was ac-
tionable confusion because at the point where motor-
ists made the decision to turn off the road to buy
petrol, the logos could not be seen. Even if they saw
the logo as they got closer, once they had already
turned off towards the station, they would most likely
continue the manoeuvre and complete the purchase at
the junior petrol station. Thus, at the time of complet-
ing the purchase there would be no confusion, but the
sale would only take place as a consequence of the
initial confusion.

On a side point, the court did not accept that such
initial interest confusion could amount to damage for
the purposes of passing off, holding (quoting from
Jif Lemon13): ‘Mere confusion which does not lead to a
sale is not sufﬁcient.’ Since consumers were not con-
fused at the point of sale, there could be no passing
off (para 68). This is perhaps an overly narrow con-
struction because it was confusion that led consumers
to turn off the road and put them into a position
where they bought the junior petrol. It can be con-
trasted with Neutrogen v Golden,14 where the Court of
Appeal was prepared to accept evidence of
initial
confusion that was remedied before sale as indicative of
damage.

that

Does initial interest confusion ﬁt within
the scheme of the Directive?
Is there a need for damage under Article
5(1)(b)?
Once the timing of confusion is separated from the
point of sale, the result is that the confusion will not
necessarily lead to a diversion of trade, or even in a
diminution of the reputation of the senior mark,15
arising from the fact
the consumer wrongly
believes that he has purchased goods made under the
authority of the senior user which turn out to be infer-
ior. Indeed, there is a spectrum of activities that can be
seen as involving initial confusion that is corrected
before the point of sale.16 At one end of the spectrum
are situations where the confusion has absolutely no
impact on the purchasing decision, perhaps because it
is momentary.17 For example, a consumer may see an
own brand product in a supermarket, brieﬂy mistake it
for the branded original, but realize his mistake before
he even picks up the own brand. At the other end are
situations where, although the confusion precedes the
point of sale, it may be too difﬁcult or require too
much effort on the part of the consumer to switch to
the goods or services of the senior user and thus, there
is a diversion of trade. This was the situation in BP v
Kelly, where ‘inertia’ was said to prevent consumers
doing a U-turn and seeking BP’s petrol, and in Fine,
where the witness had entered into a contract with the
junior estate agent and chose not to withdraw. There is
an excellent example in W & G Du Cross v Gold,18 a
passing off case involving rival taxi cabs. According to
Swinfen Eady J, a consumer who entered one of the

15 Activity which harms the reputation of the mark without necessarily

diverting trade was recognized as capable of forming the damage element
in passing off as long ago as 1917 in Ewing v Buttercup Margarine
Company, Limited [1917] 2 Ch 1.

16 The potential width of any spectrum is nicely illustrated in the US
context by J Rothman, ‘Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the
Crossroads of Trademark Law’ (2005– 6) 27 Cardozo L Rev 105, 114– 121
who describes the growth of the US action via the case-law from ‘ “initial
confusion” or confusion that occurs prior to the time of sale, to “initial
interest” involving “possible” confusion, and then to “initial interest”
absent any likely confusion’. The three cases Rothman identiﬁes as
typifying this development are: Grotian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th Steinweg
Nachf v Steinway & Sons 523 F 2d 1331 (2d Cir, 1975) (consumers would
be ‘misled into an initial interest’ in junior Grotian-Steinway pianos
because they would make an association with prestigious Steinway
pianos, even though the sophistication of the purchasers and cost of the
pianos meant that, by the time any purchase was made, they would not
be confused); Mobil Oil Corp v Pegasus Petroleum Corp 818 F 2d 254 (2d
Cir, 1987) (junior use of the name Pegasus Petroleum would give junior
user initial credibility with oil traders because they might link it with
Mobil, which used a ﬂying horse as its logo, even though the consumers
would not be confused at the time of purchasing any oil); and Brookﬁeld
Communications v West Coast Entertainment 174 F 3d 1036 (9th Cir,
1999) (senior user was the proprietor of the trade mark ‘MovieBuff ’ used

junior cabs would be unlikely to stop the driver and
dismount, even if he realized the mistake before the
end of the journey.

Somewhere in between these two extremes is the
situation where the consumer realizes relatively early
on that he is not engaging with the goods or services
he intended and could, in principle, change back to
what he originally intended or withdraw from his mis-
taken transaction, but has had his interest piqued by
the junior goods or services. For example, a consumer
may happen upon a television programme which
shares the name of a book that he has enjoyed, begins
to watch it, swiftly realizes the two are unconnected,
but anyway continues to watch the programme; or he
may click on a webpage thinking it to be that of the
senior user, quickly realize his mistake, but choose to
make a purchase from the junior site anyway. Arguably,
what occurs here is an advantage to the junior user
rather than a harm to the senior user.19

One of the factors which have led to only limited
acceptance of initial interest confusion in passing off
cases is the need for misrepresentation that results in
damage.20 This comes across strikingly in BP v Kelly
(discussed above) where this requirement meant that
initial
interest confusion was accepted for registered
trade mark infringement but rejected for passing off. It
is thus important to consider whether Article 5(1)(b)
requires damage to arise from the confusion, or
whether the mere presence of confusion is sufﬁcient. If
the latter is the case, then even examples at the extreme
end of the spectrum, where the confusion is moment-
ary and/or has no effect, could be actionable (though it
may be argued that such confusion is de minimis).

for an online ﬁlm information database; junior user, a video rental chain,
hosted an entertainment database on its website, www.westcoastvideo.
com, for which it used ‘moviebuff ’ as a metatag—although consumers
would not be confused as to which site they were visiting, they might be
‘diverted’ to the junior site once they saw it in the search results, allowing
the junior user to capture business originally intended for the senior
user).

17 This should not be confused with mere association, where the consumer
realizes all along that the two products are unconnected in terms of trade
origin, but the junior mark make him think of the senior mark.

18 W & G Du Cross v Gold (1912) 30 RPC 117.
19 This example is based loosely on the facts of Knight v Beyond Properties

Pty Ltd [2007] FSR 34, a passing off case. The claim was dismissed
though for lack of damage resulting from any confusion.

20 See D. Keeling et al, Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names
(Sweet & Maxwell London 2011) s 18: 194, C Wadlow, The Law of
Passing-Off: Unfair Competition by Misrepresentation (Sweet & Maxwell
London 2011) s 5-183 (‘As a matter of principle, it is suggested that if
misrepresentation was a material factor in obtaining the customer’s
business and the claimant suffered damage in consequence then there
may still be liability for passing off ’) and also Knight v Beyond, above,

ARTICLE

315

If, however, the confusion must result in damage, then,
at best, only cases at the other end of the spectrum
could be actionable.

The wording of the Directive
The wording of Article 5(1)(b) of the Directive and its
equivalent in the CTM Regulation make no mention of
damage.21 Instead, it merely states that an action stands
where, because of the similarity of the senior mark and
junior sign and the parties’ goods, ‘there exists a likeli-
hood of confusion on the part of the public, which
includes the likelihood of association between the sign
and the trade mark’. There is nothing to suggest that
the confusion must have any consequences. Similarly,
the CJEU, when clarifying the meaning of confusion,
has made no mention of any damage. In Canon, the
court deﬁned likelihood of confusion as the situation
‘where the public can be mistaken as to the origin of
the goods or services in question’22 and ‘the risk that
the public might believe that the goods or services in
question come from the same undertaking or . . . from
economically linked undertakings’.23 No mention was
made of the duration for which that confusion must
last, or any effect that it must have. Likewise, in both
Sabel v Puma24 and Adidas v Marca Mode I,25 where
the court limited Article 5(1)(b) to make it clear that
association per se was not a form of confusion, it did
not impose any further limitation of confusion that
would require damage. If the no-damage approach is
correct, it would mean that, subject to a de minimis
rule, all the forms of potential initial interest confusion
highlighted above would be actionable.

Consistency with the other heads of damage
While the no damage approach may be consistent with
the wording of the Directive, arguably it is inconsistent

21 Wadlow, above, n 20, implicitly suggests that damage in the passing off
sense is not necessary for registered trade mark infringement: ‘Neither
these decisions, nor that of Arnold J. in Och-Ziff Management v Och
Capital should be taken as standing for the proposition that “initial
interest confusion” in the trade mark sense is sufﬁcient for passing off.
The relevant criterion is not confusion in some abstract sense, but
misrepresentation, and the misrepresentation must be a material one, in
the sense of being really likely to cause damage.’ (Ibid, s 5-186).

whether a change in economic behaviour will be required for detriment
to repute.

with the approach taken by the CJEU to construing the
other causes of action under Article 5. In deﬁning det-
riment to distinctive character under Article 5(2), the
CJEU has looked for real effects ﬂowing from the
junior user, in the form of a change in the economic
behaviour of consumers.26 Under Article 5(1)(a), the
court has made great efforts to introduce damage in
the form of harm to one of the functions of the senior
trade mark, even though, on a literal reading, the pro-
vision calls merely for the signs and marks to be identi-
cal without any further qualiﬁcation.27 It would seem
incongruous
that background, Article
5(1)(b), the most commonly relied upon type of in-
fringement, could be satisﬁed with mere passing confu-
sion or confusion which, because it was dispelled prior
to purchase, had no further effect.28 This would not,
however, exclude confusion which continued to have
an effect even after it was dispelled, such as the situa-
tions where it would be too difﬁcult or too much effort
for consumers to revert to the senior goods or services,
even after they became aware that they had been con-
fused.

The internet and advertising cases
Arnold J in Och-Ziff pointed to the CJEU’s decisions in
the comparative advertising and internet cases as evi-
dence that no sale is necessary for there to be infringe-
ment under Article 5(1)(b). According to the judge, it
was implicit in O2,28 the case involving comparative
advertising which employed bubbles
to the
senior user’s registered bubble trade marks, that, if the
advertising had caused confusion,29 this in itself would
have amounted to Article 5(1)(b) infringement, without
the need to show any diversion of trade or similar harm
resulting from that advertising.30

similar

27 Initially in Case C-206/01 Arsenal Football Club plc v Matthew Reed

[2002] ECR I-10273, para 51 (harm to one of the functions of the senior
mark, particularly its essential function). While the CJEU has taken an
increasingly wide approach to the functions that are susceptible to harm
(see Joined cases C-236/08 to C-238/08 Google France SARL and Google
Inc v Louis Vuitton Malletier SA; Google France SARL v Viaticum SA and
Luteciel SARL; and Google France SARL v Centre national de recherche en
relations humaines (CNRRH) SARL and Others [2010] ECR I-2417, paras
75 – 81: harm to the essential, quality guarantee, communication,
investment and advertising functions all accepted as qualifying under Art
5(1)(a)), it has maintained its insistence on some form of harm. Thus,
we might expect a need for some form of damage, even if it does not
amount to diversion of trade, to be required under Art 5(1)(b) as well.

28 Case C-533/06 O2 Holdings Limited and O2 (UK) Limited v Hutchison 3G

UK Limited [2008] ECR I-4231.

29 The CJEU found, based on the facts established by the referring court,

that there was no confusion.

The judge also highlighted the CJEU’s decision in
Die BergSpechte,31 which spans both the advertising
and internet context. The senior user owned a word
and device mark which included the term ‘BergSpechte’
and ‘Edi Koblmu¨ller’ for clothing, travel arrangement
and training and sporting activities. The junior user
purchased ‘BergSpechte’ and ‘Edi Koblmu¨ller’ as adver-
tising keywords. Thus, when either term was entered
into the Google search engine, the junior user’s adver-
tisement appeared as a sponsored link. There would be
a likelihood of confusion if the advertisement

does not enable normally informed and reasonably atten-
tive internet users, or enable them only with difﬁculty, to
ascertain whether the goods or services referred to by the
ad originate from the proprietor of the trade mark or an
undertaking economically connected to it or, on the con-
trary, originate from a third party.32

that

Arnold J used this case as authority for the proposition
that it is sufﬁcient for consumers merely to view the
advertisement for there to be Article 5(1)(b) infringe-
ment, regardless of whether there is a resultant sale and
regardless of whether consumers are confused at the
time of any sale which may eventuate.33 This reading is
bolstered by the CJEU’s holding in Portakabin,34
another case involving the purchase of trade marks as
keywords by third parties,
infringement could
occur even when the junior user did not actually offer
any goods for sale in the advertisement that appeared
in response to the entering of the keyword.35 However,
the CJEU does appear to be suggesting that something
more than mere passing confusion is required. The
idea that consumers may work out the provenance of
the advertisement ‘with difﬁculty’ suggests that it is
assumed that they will spend some time studying the
advertisement. Knee-jerk conclusions would not be
enough. It is also signiﬁcant that the deﬁnition of con-
fusion given in this context (ie consumers cannot tell
the origin of the goods or services or can do so only
with difﬁculty) is exactly the same type of activity iden-

Koblmu¨ller GmbH v Gu¨nther Guni and trekking at Reisen GmbH [2010]
ECR I-2517.

32 Ibid, para 39. The CJEU appears to assume a degree of ‘internet

savviness’ on the part of the average consumer, as it is implicit in the
standard adopted that consumers will not assume that every use of a
trade mark online originates with its owner. This can be compared with
the early approach adopted in relation to domain names by the WIPO
Arbitration and Mediation panellist in the 2002 decision Magazijn ‘de
Bijenkorf ’ BV v Accelerated Information BV [2002] ETMR 62, para. 6.

35 The goods would instead be offered for sale on the junior website which

consumers would reach through clicking on the junior user’s

for the purposes of establishing Article 5(1)(a) infringe-
ment.36 As mentioned,
interpreted
Article 5(1)(a) to require harm. By using the same def-
inition, they are intimating that harm is also required
under Article 5(1)(b), which would suggest that confu-
sion per se would not sufﬁce.

the CJEU has

Non-contemporaneous confusion cases: the
CJEU’s approach
The CJEU is yet to rule explicitly on whether confusion
that precedes sale is actionable under Article 5(1)(b).37
However,
it has considered post-sale confusion in a
small number of cases, highlighted by Arnold J in
Datacard.38 In Arsenal v Reed, the CJEU considered
whether the presence of a notice on the junior user’s
stall stating that certain of the goods sold there were
not ofﬁcial Arsenal merchandise. It was argued that
this notice meant that the sale of the unofﬁcial mer-
chandise would not harm the essential function of the
senior trade mark under Article 5(1)(a). The CJEU dis-
agreed, pointing out that the notice would be ineffect-
ive if consumers came across the goods after they had
been sold and removed from the stall.39 Although this
was an Article 5(1)(a), rather than an Article 5(1)(b)
case, arguably, the approach should apply by analogy
to the latter article. The court identiﬁed the harm to
the essential function in that case as the creation of
‘the impression that there is a material
link in the
course of trade between the goods concerned and the
trade mark proprietor’.40 Moreover, as has been dis-
cussed in relation to the internet cases,
the CJEU
appears to be assimilating the two heads of damage by
reference to the same deﬁnition which involves a form
of confusion.

The Arsenal court’s approach was reafﬁrmed in
Anheuser-Busch. There the CJEU was asked to state the
conditions under which a trade mark owner can
enforce his rights under Article 16(1), of the Agreement

advertisement. Although this ﬁnding was in relation to Art 5(1)(a), the
Portakabin court stated (para 53) that its Art 5(1)(a) stance applied by
analogy to Art 5(1)(b), presumably that included this element.

36 Die Bergspechte, above, n 31, para 35, citing Google, above, n 27, paras 83
and 84, though it should be noted that harm to other functions of trade
marks (discussed above), has also been recognized under Art 5(1)(a).

37 R Burrell and D Gangjee, ‘Trade marks and freedom of expression—a call

for caution’ (2010) 41 IIC 544, 555 describe the European position as
‘unsettled’.

Ilanah Simon Fhima . Initial interest confusion

ARTICLE

Intellectual Property
on Trade-Related Aspects of
Rights. Article 5(1)(a) of the Directive is designed to
implement that provision, and so the court answered
the question by reference to its case law on Article
5(1)(a), particularly Arsenal. In terms of what would
harm the essential function of a mark, the CJEU noted:

That is the case, in particular, where the use of that sign al-
legedly made by the third party is such as to create the im-
pression that there is a material link in trade between the
third party’s goods and the undertaking from which those
goods originate. It must be established whether the consu-
mers targeted, including those who are confronted with the
goods after they have left the third party’s point of sale, are
likely to interpret the sign, as it is used by the third party,
as designating or tending to designate the undertaking
from which the third party’s goods originate.41

Once again, an effect on consumer perception post-sale
was relevant.

It is sometimes thought that the CJEU backtracked
in Ruiz-Picasso,42 discounting post-sale
confusion.
However, a close reading of the case shows that this is
not so. As Arnold J pointed out,43 what the CJEU ul-
timately considered in Ruiz-Picasso was the level of at-
tention to be imputed to relevant consumers. Although
the Advocate General considered the post-sale confu-
sion issue unfavourably,44 the CJEU noted the Arsenal
court’s comments regarding Mr Reed’s sign in relation
to Article 5(1)(a) and concluded that no general rule
could be inferred regarding the level of attention of con-
sumers under Article 5(1)(b).45 It did not rule on the
limits of post-sale confusion and instead upheld the
GC’s ﬁnding that the relevant degree of attention was a
different issue from whether circumstances subsequent
to the sale should be considered as part of the assess-
ment of trade mark infringement.46

On the assumption that post-sale confusion is ac-
tionable, it is difﬁcult to see why pre-sale confusion
should not be.47 The CJEU’s jurisprudence suggests

45 Ibid, paras 45 –47.

47 For similar reasoning in relation to passing off, see B Allgrove and P

O’Byrne, ‘Pre-sale misrepresentations in passing off: an idea whose time
has come or unfair competition by the back door?’ (2006) 1 JIPLP 413,
416.

48 See P Gillieron, ‘Online advertising business models and distinctive signs –

should one rethink the concept of confusion’ (2008) 39 IIC 688, 704–6,

that post-sale confusion causes a form of damage, in
the shape of harm to the origin function of the trade
mark. If initial interest confusion causes damage (and,
as has been noted above, certain species of pre-sale
confusion can cause very real damage), it is hard to see
why its combination of confusion plus damage should
not be actionable by analogy to the post-sale confusion
cases.

Unfair advantage
The ﬁnal piece of the jigsaw is whether, in the presence
of the unfair advantage action under Article 5(2), there
is a need for initial interest confusion at all. Across the
entire highlighted spectrum of potential initial interest
cases, it can be argued that unfair advantage is taking
place.48 Unfair advantage requires no damage, just an
unremunerated advantage for the junior user,49 and so
could potentially capture even the situation where a
supermarket own brand momentarily captures the at-
tention of consumers, particularly if the result is that
consumers purchase the own brand. While it is true
that, unlike Article 5(1)(b), the protection of Article
5(2) is limited to marks with a reputation. However,
the standard for what constitutes a reputation has been
interpreted as a low one, and it seems fair to assume
that initial
interest confusion will only occur if the
senior mark is known well enough to capture the
initial interest of confusion. However, there is some-
thing to be said for accurate labelling:
the real
problem is one of confusion, it should be labelled as
such, and ﬁtting such cases into Article 5(1)(b) would
be most appropriate.

if

The case for ‘operative’ confusion
A review of the case law reveals that there has been no
sudden rush to recognize and apply the concept of
initial interest confusion following Och-Ziff. It would
be fairer to think of initial interest confusion as devel-

who argues that ﬁnding infringement in cases involving new online
business models tends to be a manifestation of protection against free
riding, rather than being designed to prevent confusion or an increase in
consumer search costs. He does not welcome this development. See
similarly Rothman, above, n 15, 162–67, who argues that: ‘One of the
driving forces behind the adoption and proliferation of the initial interest
confusion doctrine is a gut reaction by some judges and scholars that
defendants are “free-riding” off value built up in a product or service by a
trademark holder.’ Unlike Europe, the USA does not have a general unfair
advantage/misappropriation action and Rothman views the free-riding
approach as an undesirable distortion of US trade mark law.

49 The CJEU has shown some inclination to narrow the cause of action in

Case C-323/09 Interﬂora Inc and Interﬂora British Unit v Marks & Spencer
plc and Flowers Direct Online Ltd [2012] ETMR 1, so it is not
inconceivable that in the future they would introduce a minimum level of
beneﬁt for the junior user.

oping incrementally (going back to at least BP v Kelly
and continuing in the light of Och-Ziff) and by analogy
to post-sale confusion and the internet and advertising
cases, with Och-Ziff being just one step in this process.
Initial
interest confusion is not without its dangers.
In particular, there is the potential
for momentary
confusion that is very quickly addressed and causes
no damage to become actionable.
is
what appears to have happened in the USA.50 It is
unclear whether the Trade Mark Directive can effective-
ly prevent such a situation arising, and the literal
wording suggests that mere confusion is all that is
required for an Article 5(1)(b) action. On the other
hand, the CJEU has actively sought damage in relation
to all other forms of
infringement, even where the
wording of the Directive has suggested that this is not
necessary.

Indeed,

this

Within these parameters, the CJEU has been willing
to provide an action against damage which affects how
consumers behave.51 Closest
to our concerns is its
acknowledgement of post-sale confusion. Once confu-
sion that leads to damage is recognized in that sphere,

it is hard, as a matter of principle, to justify not recog-
nizing it in relation to pre-sale confusion, where the
potential for damage in many (though not all) cases is
arguably clearer. Perhaps the best way forward would
be to leave the labels of ‘post’, ‘pre’ and ‘at time of sale’
confusion behind, and instead look for ‘operative’ con-
fusion, that is confusion which has an effect on how
consumers behave. This would encompass, inter alia,
causing consumers to enter a transaction with an unin-
tended party under a misapprehension, causing consu-
mers to enter into a transaction or course of action
from which they cannot or will not extricate themselves
at the point at which they realize their error, altering
consumer behaviour by virtue of a misapprehension
about the origin of the goods that prevents consumers
from making further purchases of the senior goods or
through otherwise altering their perception of
the
senior mark or its owner in a negative way.52 As well as
solving difﬁcult
timing issues, this approach would
allow the courts to provide a remedy in all cases where
confusion leads
to damage, while excluding those
where it had a negligible effect.

50 Described by Rothman, above, n 16, particularly in relation to Brookﬁeld.
51 In this context, ‘bait and switch selling’, where a trader invites consumers
to purchase a particular product with the intention of substituting it for
a different product, is classed as a commercial practice which is always
considered unfair under Annex I, point 6 of Directive 2005/29 concerning
unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market
and amending Council Directives 84/450 97/7, 98/27 and 2002/65 and
Regulation 2006/2004 (the ‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’).
While it cannot be presumed that measures classed as unfair commercial

practices amount to trade mark infringement, it does suggest that the
zeitgeist is against such confusion, even though consumers would know at
the time of any eventual sale that they were not getting which they
originally offered.

52 Indeed, arguably this was one of the most important forms of harm in

Och-Ziff, above, n 1, with the danger that if the junior user did not
conduct its business appropriately, confused consumers would attribute
any negative perceptions to the senior user.
