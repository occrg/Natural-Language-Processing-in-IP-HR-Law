Why America needs a European fashion police
Kamal Preet*

Fashion in the USA
An artist paints a beautiful scene of the sea, using a wide
array of shades of blue. The moment she ﬁxes her idea
on to the canvas, she receives copyright protection
under the law. A company produces a variety of pro-
ducts for men, women, and children ranging from
apparel and accessories to a home collection; once they
afﬁx a spinnaker logo design and use the mark in com-
merce, they may obtain trade mark protection. A cloth-
ing designer creates a scene of a woman sitting at a cafe´
in Paris with the Eiffel tower as a backdrop on a chiffon
blouse with satin lining yet may not receive any copy-
right or trade mark protection for his design or product
because it is only recognized as a useful object rather
than an ornamental form of expression, creativity, or as
a designator of commercial origin. Why is this so?

Currently,

the fashion industry is a multi-billion
dollar business, among the largest industries in the USA
that proﬁts from creative content. While the fashion
industry lives through creative apparel designs, it falls
outside the spectrum of IP law and receives no legal pro-
tection or rights for its creators. This lack of protection
has led to a trend in design copying which has sparked
great variety in clothing and accessory designs available
for consumers in the USA. The more copying there is,
the more incentive designers have to produce new cre-
ations and clothing designs for the US market, thereby
supporting competitiveness in commerce. Copying in
the US fashion industry is encouraged, unlike in other
creative industries, and increased commercial competi-
tiveness is seen as one of the strongest arguments against
providing protection for clothing designs.

Fashion designs are pieces of artwork just like crea-
tive productions in other industries and should also
receive protection. Clothing not only serves a utilitarian
purpose of covering one’s body, but also, in a nation
where freedom of speech is so highly valued, it has
evolved into a form of expression. Legal protection for
fashion designs will promote competitiveness and lead
to an even wider array of apparel designs. The current
IP law on Community designs
in the European
Union shows substantial support for this argument.

to protect their designs in its 27 member states by

Unregistered Community Design regulations in April

appearance of a product. Enforcement of these regu-
lations provides design protection for up to 25 years if
registered designs are renewed on time, and for up to 3
years for any unregistered designs. Despite these Regu-
lations, Europe remains the hub of haute couture,
which remains a big business.

to protect

Haute couture in the US fashion industry receives no
protection under IP law, which has led design copying
to become a serious problem. This article discusses
challenges
faced under current US copyright and
patent laws and will focus particularly on the difﬁcul-
ties faced in trade mark law for fashion design pro-
tection.
trade mark signiﬁes a
company’s mark for its goods or services, a new
fashion design is unique to the designer and serves as a
mark for her reputation and goodwill and thus should
have protection as well.

The article then evaluates the proposal of the Design
Piracy Prohibition Act (DPPA) in March 2006 before
Congress, which sought to provide copyright-like pro-
tection to fashion designs for a period of 3 years under
the Copyright Act, explaining why the DPPA is unlikely
to be effective. Then, having considered the European
Union’s
and unregistered Community
designs, this article explains why this is the ideal sol-
ution—and a necessary one—for fashion designers in
the USA.

Current provisions of US IP law
The fashion industry is a fast-paced, evolving business
where designers produce seasonal goods to meet the
traditional expectations of consumers and the aspira-
tions of prevalent designers and fashion houses to
display their latest collections during semiannual events
at Fashion Week. Paris, New York, Milan, and London,
considered the leading fashion capitals, hold ‘Fall’ and
‘Spring’ fashion weeks showcasing collections several
months in advance of the season so as to allow the
press, buyers from major stores and retailers and other
members of the entertainment industry time to decide
whether to purchase or incorporate these designers and
their works. Given the short life expectancy of fashion
designs as well as their functional purpose as clothing,
there is difﬁculty in applying IP law in the fashion
industry.

foundation for copyright and patent

Copyright
The Constitution of the USA provides that the Con-
gress has the power to promote the progress of science
to
and useful arts, by securing for limited times
authors and inventors the exclusive right
to their
respective writings and discoveries.1 The constitution is
the legal
law,
granting the right to protect the creative works of
authors, artists, and inventors. Currently, US copyright
law offers no protection for fashion designs in apparel
on the grounds that they are ‘useful articles’ that do
not exist physically or conceptually separate from the
clothing itself.2 Copyright law protects ‘original works
of authorship ﬁxed in a tangible medium of expression’,
which exclude items with a functional as well as
aesthetic purpose.3 The general consensus among the

courts is that a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural aspect
of a fashion work is too close to the functional aspects
of the work to make any kind of separability possible,
thereby denying copyright protection.4

in trying to meet

Patents
inventions
Patent law provides protection for useful
for articles of manufacture
and original designs
through utility patents and design patents, respectively.
Using design patents to protect fashion designs raises
several problems
the required
showing of novelty, non-obviousness, ornamentality,
and non-functionality. Additionally, the courts have
doubted whether clothing can even qualify for design
‘To determine whether a design is primarily
patents.
functional or primarily ornamental,
the design is
viewed in its entirety to determine whether the claimed
design is dictated by the utilitarian purpose of the
article.’5 Since clothing has a functional purpose, only
certain aspects of fashion design are eligible for design
patent protection. The courts are thus unlikely to ﬁnd
patent protection for the overall fashion design. More-
over, since patent protection is for inventions, it is dif-
ﬁcult to apply it to fashion designs where there is
insufﬁcient novelty in new designs. The patent process
is also an expensive, lengthy, and complicated process,
which can take more than 2 years to review. Further,
design patents grant 14 years of protection, which is
excessive for protecting fashion works that have a short
life span.6

Trade marks
A detailed examination of current trade mark concepts
shows that this body of law is inadequate for protection
of fashion designs. Both state and federal law govern
trade marks today, with federal law supplying the most
protection available across the USA. Federal trade mark
law is governed by the Lanham Act, enacted in 1946,
and most recently amended in 1996, which deﬁnes a
trade mark as ‘any word, name, symbol, or device or
any combination thereof adopted and used by a manu-
facturer or merchant to identify his goods and dis-
tinguish them from those manufactured or sold by
others’.7 A trade mark serves as an objective symbol of
the good will a business has built up so as to provide
its consumers the rights to anticipation satisfaction

from the products or services they purchase.8 Generally,
there are four functions that trade marks must perform
to obtain legal protection:

1. To identify one seller’s goods and distinguish them

from goods sold by others.

2. To signify that all goods bearing that trade mark
come from or are controlled by a single albeit
anonymous source.

3. To signify that all goods bearing the trade mark are

of equal level of quality.

4. As a prime instrument in advertising and selling the

goods.9

Nonetheless, the purpose of a trade mark is to avoid
consumer confusion, mistake, or deception in their
purchasing decisions, not to provide rights of exclusiv-
ity giving a monopoly over its use.10

Trade mark law as it exists today can adequately
protect logos, names, and other symbols placed on gar-
ments, but the criteria for protection under the Lanham
Act and state trade mark law do not extend to protection
for an entire article of clothing as a fashion item.11 Many
designers have attempted to secure their creative work for
an entire garment under trade dress protection, arguing
that the products’ overall image, that is, its ‘design and
appearance’, justiﬁes protection because it qualiﬁes as a
source of origin.12 Trade dress law prevents consumer
confusion for the ‘look and feel’ of a product’s packaging,
by examining the totality of the elements, which may
include the product’s shape, colour, graphics, packaging,
and label.13 Since trade dress focuses on a product’s
overall appearance, it is the most applicable under IP law
to protection of fashion design.

Since trade dress focuses on a product’s overall
appearance, it is the most applicable under IP law

In order to receive trade dress protection, the Lanham Act
requires that trade dress either be inherently distinctive, or

have acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning;
a likelihood of confusion must exist between the trade
dress of the original product and that of the knockoff
product; and the trade dress employed must serve no
utilitarian or aesthetic function.14 It is this last element
that is problematic for fashion works because it provides
that, if a product is recognized due to its appearance from
its design features, then it has aesthetic functionality and
cannot receive legal protection under the law.15 In Banff
Ltd v Express, Inc., the court held that

the plaintiff ’s objective in the two sweater designs was pri-
marily aesthetic, the designs were not primarily intended
as source identiﬁcation . . . [and] therefore fail to qualify
for protection of trade dress inherent in product design.16

This kind of case law is indicative of the lack of
the courts have for the fashion
understanding that
industry because certain aesthetic features and design
elements, such as arrangement of stripes or display
of ﬂoral designs do in fact serve as source indicators.
Furthermore, recognizing clothing merely as a piece of
cloth that has the sole purpose of covering your body—
and as nothing else—shows the courts’ unwillingness to
apply trade dress protection for fashion design works.17

Even if designers can address functionality concerns,
they must still establish the requisite distinctiveness. In
1992, the United States Supreme Court resolved the
circuit split regarding the requirement of secondary
meaning in establishing trade dress by holding in Two
Pesos, Inc. v Taco Cabana, Inc. that trade dress that is
inherently distinctive is protectable under the Lanham
Act §43(a) without showing that it has acquired sec-
ondary meaning.18 Two Pesos then became a landmark
case in the haute couture industry because clothing
designs are usually inherently distinctive enough for
consumers to identify with its designer, the source,
without the requirement of being on the market for a
signiﬁcant period to build up secondary meaning.19

product in question was a line of spring/summer one-
piece children’s outﬁts decorated with applique´s of
hearts, ﬂowers, and fruits. Samara Brothers brought
action against Wal-Mart for trade dress infringement
by sale of knock-offs of the children’s dress designs.21
Wal-Mart sold these knocks-offs for a lower price than
JC Penney, generating more than $1.5 million in gross
proﬁts. Samara Brothers discovered this after a buyer
complained that their garments were on sale at Wal-
Mart for a lower price than that which JC Penney was
allowed to charge.22 The Court’s holding in this case
put a stop to protection of clothing designs again, since
the short life span of ‘clothing’s marketability more or
less precludes its attaining a secondary meaning until
the item is no longer “in fashion”, at which point a suit
to protect would be meaningless’.23

Why then does US law not protect fashion works? A
likely reason is that the fashion industry thrives on
copying, thus demanding an inquiry into whether legal
prohibition against design copying is ever appropriate.
In answering this question, it is important to consider
whether this creative design process will be inhibited
because that in turn will determine whether the fashion
industry will remain commercially competitive. High-
end designs are borrowed, reinterpreted, and produced
as knock-offs as lower priced designs all the time.
These cheaper imitations are usually successful because
there is high consumer demand for comparable clothes
at a lower price. In reality, these cheaper imitations are
not comparable, but dilute original couture designs
that can never truly be replicated.

The Design Piracy Prohibition Act
The Council of Fashion Designers, whose members
include Diane Von Furstenberg, Narciso Rodriguez,
and Zac Posen,
lobbied Washington for a new anti-
copying campaign, seeking copyright protections for
fashion works under the Copyright Act.24 On 30 March
2006, Congressman Robert William ‘Bob’ Goodlatte
introduced the DPPA, to extend copyright protection
to fashion designs for a 3-year term that commences
upon whichever is earlier: the date of publication of

the registration or the date the design is ﬁrst made
public.25

The DPPA has been dormant since its proposal but,
if passed, would amend Protection of Original Designs
under Section 1301 of title 17 in the United States
Code to provide protection for fashion design.26 This
section, commonly referred to as the boat hull statute,
currently protects ‘an original design of a useful article
which makes the article attractive or distinctive in
appearance to the purchasing or using public’ and ‘the
design of a vessel hull, including a plug or mold’.27
Fashion designers are campaigning for similar protec-
tion for clothing as provided in this boat hull statute,
which was introduced in 1998 to classify boat hulls as a
design protected for 10 years.28 That statute protects
two kinds of designs: an original design of a useful
article which is attractive or distinctive in appearance
and vessel hulls.29 Under the DPPA, the term ‘fashion
design’ would be listed as a third kind of design, receiv-
ing protection for
the appearance as a whole of
including its ornamentation.30
an article of apparel,
Apparel is deﬁned broadly to include articles of cloth-
ing, headgear, handbags, belts, and eyeglass frames.31
Further, the DPPA excludes any fashion designs embo-
died in a useful article that was made public by the
designer or owner in the USA or a foreign country
more than 3 months before the date of the application
for registration.32

With damages starting at $250,000 or $5 a copy,

to any
article’s design which has been copied from an image
of a protected design without

owner.33 The act limits infringement to making, having
made,
importing, selling, or distributing any article
embodying a design which was created without knowl-
edge or reasonable grounds to know what protection
for the design is claimed and was copied from such
protected design.34 The proposed revision applies the
doctrines of secondary infringement and secondary
liability to actions related to original designs by making
any person liable under either doctrine subject to all
remedies,
including those attributable to any under-
lying or resulting infringement.35 Finally, this addition

to determine whether

to the Copyright Act would require the Register of
Copyrights
the application
relates to a design which appears to be within the
subject matter protected as original designs and, if so,
register the design.36

Current copyright law does not protect a design of a
useful article if it cannot be physically or conceptually
separated from the useful article. For fashion designs,
this involves showing that the artistic design aspects are
separable from the article of clothing, which is nearly
impossible for fashion works. If the design’s pictorial,
graphical, or sculptural features cannot exist indepen-
dently of the utilitarian aspects of the article then it
cannot be copyright-protected.37 Much of copyright
case law has denied fashion designs protection due to
the inability to penetrate this functionality barrier. The
proposed DPPA extends protection to fashion works
without resolving this functionality barrier to serve as a
legislative exception to this utilitarian doctrine.

The DPPA focuses on fashion works and haute
couture designs as original creations that should receive
copyright protection, but fails to recognize that these
designs also sometimes serve as source identiﬁers of
goods and services, thus being entitled to trade mark
protection.38 Therefore, the proposed revision to the
Copyright Act, though a step in the right direction, still
lacks a crucial aspect in terms of protecting both a
designer’s goodwill and creativity. Since this provision
alone is insufﬁcient to protect the fashion industry ade-
quately, regardless of whether the Congress passes it,
the USA will still be missing an important form of pro-
tection: the reputation and goodwill a designer’s name
carries to prevent consumer confusion.

A trade mark does not confer a right to prohibit the use of
the word or words . . . [because] it is not a copyright. A
trade mark only gives the right to prohibit the use of it so
far as to protect the owner’s good will against the sale of
another’s product as his.39

Whereas copyright protection will prevent others from
copying the original creation, trade mark law is necess-
ary in order to protect the good will and thwart others
from producing counterfeits or knock-offs. Protecting
the goodwill of a business is important because cheaper

imitations that may be ‘confusingly similar’ will still be
likely, thereby being susceptible to dilution of designer
brands which would still have no means of trade mark
protection. Nevertheless,
the DPPA should not be
passed; instead, a new regulation should be drafted to
include protection both for creative original designs
and for recognition for the name of the artist and
goodwill his work carries for him. The European
Union follows this kind of approach and therefore
offers a good solution for the fashion industry.

Community designs
The European Union offers swift, cost-effective design
protection in two forms: registered rights and unregis-
tered rights. Registered rights require the ﬁling of an
application while unregistered rights exist automatically
once a design has been recorded but with lesser forms
of protection than registered designs. This new system
has created a uniform legal regime, providing protec-
tion for many sectors of the economy (clothing, tex-
tiles, shoes, cars,
furniture, tableware, and
ceramics) across the European Union.40 After 2002, the
Community designs system began to serve as a model
of legal reform throughout the world; the USA should
also use this regime as a form of effective protection
for fashion designs.41

jewellery,

Unlike

the proposed DPPA, design is broadly
deﬁned as ‘the appearance of the whole or a part of a
product resulting from the features of, in particular,
the lines, contours, colours, shape,
texture, and/or
materials of the product itself and/or its ornamenta-
tion’.42 For a registered design to receive protection, it
does not have to be a non-functional product without
aesthetic qualities, so long as the design is not dictated
entirely by the function of the product.43 Additionally,
the design must be new and have a different overall
to designs already within the public
appearance
domain. Finally,
it must not be contrary to public
policy or accepted principles of morality.

One beneﬁt of registered designs is that they have an
‘exclusive right to use and prevent making, offering,
putting on the market, importing, exporting, using or
stocking for such purposes, products incorporating the
design, which do not produce a different overall

impression’ and thus may be infringed regardless of
independent creation.44

Registration of a design allows protection for 5 years,
with four 5-year renewal terms. An application can be
ﬁled directly with the Ofﬁce for Harmonisation in the
Internal Market (OHIM) or through the 25 Industrial
Property Ofﬁces of the Member States (including the
Benelux) with payment of required fees (E350 for a
single application). Any natural person or legal entity
from any country may ﬁle an application, thereby pro-
viding no requirements or restrictions in order to attain
protection for a design. Moreover, a single application
may include multiple designs that have no relation to
one another. For example, a designer can register an
entire line of clothing with different garments and
articles of clothing for the season under one application,
which makes attaining protection convenient and less
cumbersome. Once designs are registered, they are pub-
lished bi-monthly in the nine new ofﬁcial languages of
the EU in the Community Design Bulletin, which
includes a searchable database.45 Both registered and
unregistered Community designs receive the same scope
of protection, the only difference being that the latter
receives a shorter period of protection.46

Both registered and unregistered Community
designs receive the same scope of protection, the
only difference being that the latter receives a
shorter period of protection

Both share the requirements of novelty and individual
character in order to receive protection.47 The EU pro-
vides an automatic design right when a new design is
made public which lasts for 3 years from the date the
design was made available to the public.48 The date
and means of disclosure to the public of a design are
essential because they create the unregistered Commu-
nity design right while also destroying the novelty of a
registered design if
it is not applied for within 12

months of the disclosure.49 Disclosure to the public is
sufﬁcient so long as it is ‘known in the normal course
of business to the circles specialised in the sector con-
cerned operating within the Community’.50 In order to
ensure proof of adequate disclosure in case of possible
legal proceedings, it is crucial to keep every element of
proof that disclosure has been launched or reached,
especially the date of ﬁrst disclosure.51 Furthermore,
just as a single application for a registered Community
design provides protection in all EU member states,
disclosure within one member state may be sufﬁcient if
it is made in such a way that the interested circles of
the industry within the EU have a possibility of becom-
ing aware of the design.52 For example, if disclosure of
a fashion garment is made during Fashion Week in one
country, then it is most likely that the majority, if not
all, of the interested circles from the other countries
will also be present, thereby rendering birth of the right
less difﬁcult to establish.53

Unlike registered designs, if a second designer creates
the design independently, that is, if the designer shows
he was not aware of the existence of the protected
design, there is no infringement.54 For fashion works,
which have a short life span, unregistered design law in
the EU is the ideal protection. Moreover, if a designer
doubts how the market will react to a certain product,
she has a grace period of 1 year to test the market with
just
the protection of an unregistered Community
design and then to register a Community design.55 The
purpose of this grace period is to ensure the novelty of
the design and still receive protection.
if the
national design application was ﬁled less than six
months earlier, then it is possible to claim the priority
of that earlier application date within the registered
community design application.’56 If a designer registers
his design more than 1 year after the ﬁrst disclosure,
then the registered community design may be subject
to subsequent invalidity.57 Thus, a designer would not
be able to receive unregistered community design
protection for 3 years and then ﬁle an application for
a registered community design: the novelty element
would be lacking.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2008, Vol. 3, No. 6

Finally,

the EU provides an additional kind of
protection for designs that
the USA would still be
missing even if the Copyright Act were amended to
include the DPPA. The EU provides the option of com-
bining Community design protection with other forms
of IP. For example, a designer can potentially receive
design rights for an entire line of clothing he creates as
well as register the design of the distinctive product
shape or its packaging as a Community trade mark.58
The scope of design protection is concerned with
appearance and must be new and have individual char-
acter, whereas a trade mark is concerned with origin
and must be capable of distinguishing the goods and
services concerned. By recognizing dual rights, the EU
can adequately prevent design infringement, reinforce
arguments against rights for either kind of protection as
well as more readily compensate designers in damages.

including personal names, designs,

A Community trade mark may consist of any signs
capable of being represented graphically, particularly
words,
letters,
numerals, the shape of goods, or of their packaging,
provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing
the goods or services of one undertaking from those of
other undertakings.59 Though there is a difference
between design and trade mark, that being the shape of
a product and identiﬁcation of trade origin of product
or service, respectively, an article of clothing can still
receive both Community trade mark and design pro-
tection so long as the shape of the garment is novel
and simultaneously serves as a source indicator. This is
often so when a designer launches a new collection for
the upcoming season because there is a general look or
feature that will be common throughout the different
articles of clothing within the entire collection, this
being a symbol of the goods that a designer provides.
Nonetheless, the EU provides a much more detailed
and adequate form of protection for fashion designs
than the USA and continues to retain a competitive
market for the fashion industry.

An incentive for the US fashion
industry?
The USA should adopt the European Union’s registered
and unregistered Community designs as a model for its
own legislation instead of adopting the DPPA. This
would encourage designers from other parts of the
world to bring their work into the USA, thereby result-
ing in an increase in commerce, as well as possible
employment opportunities.60 Currently, a designer
marketing fashion works in the USA can be easily
copied or even worse be subject to imitation even
before a design is readily sold in commerce, merely
from a disclosure at a fashion show months before.

leading American designers

Designers currently have no incentive to bring their
work to the USA,
to
venture abroad to seek protection for their creative
artwork and depriving American society of not just the
latest clothing, but also economic privileges like jobs
and the right to creative expression through fashion.61
The EU scheme is the ideal model for fashion works
and if the USA were to adopt this convenient regis-
tration process, it would beneﬁt the nation in many
ways. Due to the short life span of fashion designs,
the unregistered protection plan is an adequate form
of protection because it gives designers the ability to
their
choose whether
garments after having an opportunity to test
the
market. Nevertheless, this model needs to be protected
especially now, in a time where design copying has led
to increasing numbers of knockoffs and cheaper imita-
tions, a serious problem that needs to be remedied for
the sake of the future of the fashion industry. With a
conscious effort, the USA can and should mend this
issue, which, at a nominal price would beneﬁt designers
and enrich American consumers’ choices with more
groundbreaking creations from protected designers.
