Inventions involving human embryonic stem cells (hESC)
have unprecedented potential to improve human life
through discovery of new drugs and treatment of
incurable neurodegenerative diseases, but at the same
time, the use of human embryos in research gives rise to
contrasting ethical, moral and religious views on the
patentability of such inventions. Whether and to what
extent patent offices should take these views into account
is an open question. The “ordre public” and “morality”
clause in patent law may help us find an answer, but
neither the legislator nor courts have clarified the meaning
of these vague terms. Judicial
interpretation has some-
times increased their ambiguity and raised legal uncer-
tainty for the patentability of hESC inventions. This
situation may be desirable in some cases, but not in
others where the principles of the legal system as a whole
come into play. This paper will shed light on the meaning
of “ordre public” and “morality” for hESC inventions by
examining patent law in the broader legal framework and
emphasizing the interconnectedness of national
legal
systems in a global market as well as the common interest
in healthcare innovations.

INTRODUCTION

| 33

We are living in an era where Frankenstein's inventions have become a reality. Dolly the sheep, human-pig
chimeras (Wu et al., 2017), and human genome editing for therapeutic purposes are all inventions driven by
scientific reasons, but they unavoidably spur a debate on the ethics, morality, public acceptance and philosophical
foundations of such inventions. When these inventions are patented, the discussion on different interests and
values underlying “Frankenstein's inventions” transposes into patent law. Among these inventions, human
embryonic stem cell (hESC) inventions may be considered the most controversial because they have the potential
to introduce inheritable changes into the human genome. This may occur, for example, when the CRISPR-Cas9
technique is applied to modify the DNA of human embryos in order to cure genetic diseases. The main clash of
values and interests in this case is between those that seek to improve human health and those that fear the
creation of designer babies or humans with superlative skills as depicted in the movie Gattaca.1 Although these
inventions and related patents have not yet materialized, it is interesting to note that the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) has awarded a patent on “gamete donor selection,” which enables prospective parents
to handpick a sperm or egg donor with whom they would be likely to produce a child born with desirable traits
(FDA News Release, 2017) and the Japan Patent Office now allows patents on CRISPR-Cas9 applied to hESC as
long as the invention does not aim at creating a human being. These patents encourage research with hESC in
order to improve human life through discovery of new drugs, treatment of incurable neurodegenerative diseases,
drug toxicity arrays, organ transplantation and through an understanding of the origin of health problems (Atala,
2009), but they may also represent a step toward human genome modification.2

The current debate on the patentability of hESC inventions, however, focusses on the destruction of the embryo.3
The generation of human embryos implies the destruction of the blastocyst, a structure in early development that
contains a cluster of cells from which the embryo arises (Expert Group, 2016, p.133). Some deem the destruction of
the blastocyst equivalent to the destruction of an unborn child, while others sustain that the blastocyst will never
develop into a child unless implanted in the uterus wall (EuroStemCell, 2018). This ethical dilemma on the status of the
embryo4 and related social concerns enter into patent law through the public policy clause. This clause, which
excludes some types of inventions from patentability, is found in art. 27. 2 of the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). The provision gives an option to World Trade Organization
(WTO) countries to exempt subject matter from patentability for reasons of “ordre public” and “morality”:

Members may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial
exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or
plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made
merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law.

Art. 27.2 of the TRIPS Agreement article recognizes the differences between different jurisdictions.5 Prior to the
TRIPS agreement, the EU, Japan, New Zealand and other WTO members had a public policy clause in their patent
systems, contrary to Australia (Monger & Clark, 2013) Canada6 or the United States (Bagley, 2003, pp. 469–547). The
implementation of the TRIPS Agreement did not affect their provisions on “ordre public” and “morality” or public
policy. In any case, art. 27.2 gives poor guidance on the type of inventions that should be excluded from patentability.
The vagueness of its terms can be clarified by courts and national legislation. But the interpretation of these legal
terms in different jurisdictions may result in different types of permissible hESC inventions under national patent laws.
This situation creates legal uncertainty, it may hinder the competitivity of research institutions and business firms that
operate internationally,7 and thus run counter to the objectives of the TRIPS Agreement.8 In order to shed light on the
matter, this paper will clarify the limits of “ordre public” and “morality” for hESC inventions. It will first explain the
rationale of these limits and their significance for hESC inventions. Then it will try to elucidate the meaning of the
terms through an analysis of courts’ decisions and suggest some criteria for assessing “ordre public” and “morality” for

hESC inventions. The legal considerations will build upon elaborations on the concept of ethics as a set of values that
guides judicial and legislative decisions.

2 | THE RATIONALE OF THE “ORDRE PUBLIC” AND “MORALITY” CLAUSE
IN PATENT LAW

The public policy clause in patent law restricts the scope of patent rights ex-ante. This means that patents cannot be
granted for the subject matter that falls under the patent clause. This type of limitation to patent rights is known as
“exclusion to patent rights” (Christie, 2011, p. 121). Exclusions to patent rights are not new. They have their origin in
national laws. European countries excluded some type of inventions from patentability for reasons of public health,
morals, or safety, or as being contrary to the general interest of the state since the nineteenth century.9 Other
countries such as Japan and China refer to inventions liable to contravene public order, morality or public health (art.
32 of the Japan Patent Act) and to creations that violate the law or social ethics, or harm public interests (art. 5 of the
Patent Law of the People's Republic of China), respectively. The United States have also considered morally
controversial inventions under the requirements of utility and subject matter as delineated in section 101 of the
Patent Act (Bagley, 2007, pp. 317–320; Bently et al., 2010, p. 53). Justice Story is repeatedly quoted for explaining
that a “useful” invention is one “which may be applied to a beneficial use in society, in contradistinction to an invention
injurious to the morals, health, or good order of society, or frivolous or insignificant. (emphasis added)” (Notes on the
Patent Laws). Although the Supreme Court later declared that the power to impose limits to patentability of subject
matter belongs only to Congress,10 the USPTO clarified that “inventions directed to human/non-human chimera
could, under certain circumstances, not be patentable because, among other things, they would fail to meet the public
policy and morality aspects of the utility requirement” (Bagley, 2007, p. 321).

A WIPO study identifies six public policy justifications for exclusions from patentability (Bently et al., 2010, pp.
44–45) and it notes that these justifications are subject to change.11 For the purpose of this paper, two rationales are
relevant. Those that aim at excluding undesirable subject matter from patent protection and those that recognize
countervailing policy considerations. The first type of rationale can be understood in relation to the role of patent law
in signaling the kind of desirable activity under the patent system (Schneider, 2009, pp. 129–157). In this respect, the
Board of Appeal of the EPO has argued that the ordre public and morality clause is a question of principle to safeguard
the public trust in the patent system as a whole (Stauder, 2016, pp. 200–201). This rationale can be further explained
based on economic reasoning. Neoclassical economic theory suggests that patents act as incentives to invest in R&D.
The absence of patents in a technological field will discourage research in that particular field. Since patents guide “the
investment of capital in the use and development of pre-existing developments” (Hadley, 1986, p. 134), they can be a
means to direct the flow of capital toward improvements of current research. In absence of patents, the capital may be
directed toward more profitable research. Patents remain a business tool for companies to capture their investment
although some argue that other types of IP rights or regulatory mechanisms may play a more important role that
patents in personalized medicine (Burk, 2015, pp. 232-255; Price II, 2016, pp.1401–1452). In this way, patent grants
signal desirable types of inventions and indirectly influence the inventive activity.

The exclusion based on countervailing policy considerations takes account of values and rights that deserve
protection. In terms of the issue at hand, it may be envisaged that patents on hESC may be counterbalanced against
the right to health. For example, patents may increase prices for hESC-based inventions and impair the right to receive
healthcare for patients who cannot afford high prices. In this case, competition law can be a more appropriate
mechanism to address the monopoly effects of patents. Indeed, several authors propose to leave the public policy
clause outside the patent realm (Bagley, 2007, pp. 317–320; Strauss, 2002, pp. 45–62) since patent examiners are not
well-equipped to decide on matters beyond patent law (Treichel, 2009, p. 450). Others argue that the patent system is
the only legal arena where technologies are investigated on a case-by-case basis and the EPO may be particularly apt
to make decisions on the matter (Sterckx & Cobain, 2012, p. 300). Moreover, the interpretation of art. 27.2 is quite

complex. For example, the exclusion concerns the commercial exploitation of the patent, not the patent per se.12 The
irrelevance of national laws in defining “ordre public” and “morality” may, in particular, seem difficult to conceive
because if a country prohibits the commercial exploitation of an invention, there may be no interest to grant a patent.
Similarly, if a country allows the commercial exploitation of the invention, there may be no interest to disallow the
patent.

Since the TRIPS Agreement was negotiated with the aim to foster trade, the author of this paper believes that the
wording “exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law” can be better understood in
relation to the international system. This may be the case of a company that has protected the invention in countries
where patentability is allowed but it also intends to obtain a patent in a country that prohibits research or has no
regulations on the patented invention in order to have market power when laws change in the future. Even if the
provision is applied in the national context, it can have a significance when the legislator plans to change the
regulation. Legislative procedures may be long and complicated compared to patent processes. In some cases, it may
be quicker and easier to grant a patent while waiting for the regulatory change. Indirectly, patent offices play a
regulatory role13 but their position cannot depart from governmental objectives. Patent grants are often political
decisions that indicate the types of inventions that can be deemed beneficial for the public. This may occur when a
patent is granted on an invention for which no regulation is in place yet. Indeed, this is the case of hESC inventions.
Different countries have different regulations for hESC research (EuroStemCell, 2017) but new scientific discoveries
in the field create legal loopholes. Until the legislative body takes a decision on the ethical aspects of patentability,
patent offices will bear the burden. This is especially the case of those countries that have an “ordre public” and
“morality” clause into their patent laws.

3 | THE MEANING OF “ORDRE PUBLIC” AND “MORALITY” IN PATENT
LAW FOR hESC INVENTIONS

Although exclusions aim at providing clear boundaries for patentability, they are a “constant source of contention”
(Bently et al., 2010, p. 67). The vagueness of the terms “ordre public” and “morality” is a significant example of
interpretative difficulty. Their meaning can be clarified through definitions offered by dictionaries, literature and court
cases. The terms “ordre public” and “morality” have their origin in French law (Gervais, 2008, pp. 334–350). While a
definition of “morality” as “a set of social standards for good behavior” (Morality, n.d.) or “principles concerning the
distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior” (Morality, n.d.) offered by dictionaries may correspond
to the French concept of bonnes mœurs14 understood as “the degree of conformity to moral principles (especially
good)” (Gervais, 2008, p. 345; UNCTAD-ICTSD, 2005, p. 375) it is not possible to find a definition of “ordre public” in
English. In French law, the term is an evolutionary concept that expresses concerns about “matters threatening the
social structures of civil society as such” (Gervais, 2008, pp. 343–344). The EPO guidelines explain that the purpose of
this public policy clause is to “deny protection to inventions likely to induce riot or public disorder, or to lead to criminal
or other generally offensive behaviour” (EPO Guidelines, 2018, Part G- Chapter II–4.1). According to the guidelines,
the provision will be invoked in rare and extreme cases, when the public would “regard the invention as so abhorrent
that the grant of patent rights would be inconceivable.” On the other hand, the concept of morality has been related to
the belief that some behavior is right and acceptable whereas other behavior is wrong, this belief being founded on the
totality of the accepted norms which are deeply rooted in a particular culture.15 Obviously, this explanation offers
poor guidance for hESC inventions, which need a case-by-case evaluation.

It is worth focusing our attention on EPO case law since the EPO boards of appeal have decided 26 cases on “ordre
public” and “morality.” Ten of them concern hESC inventions.16 While it is not possible to infer a general rule on the
interpretation of the public policy clause because the EPO judges have elaborated different tests for assessing “ordre
public” and “morality” depending on the subject matter,17 we can refer to art. 53 (a) of the Convention on the Grant of

6

PRIFTI

European Patents known as the European Patent Convention (EPC)18 as the legislative basis for EPO decisions. This
provision establishes that European patents shall not be granted in respect of:

inventions the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to ‘ordre public’ or morality; such
exploitation shall not be deemed to be so contrary merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation in
some or all of the Contracting States.

R. 28 of the Implementing Regulations to the EPC further explains that under art. 53 (a), patents should not be

granted on the following inventions:

1. processes for cloning human beings;
2. processes for modifying the germline genetic identity of human beings;
3. uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes;

Since R. 28 is a special provision compared to the general provision of art. 53 (a), this means that patentability
decisions on hESC inventions should first be examined under this rule. If a decision cannot be reached, the provisions
on “ordre public” and “morality” should be assessed. The application of R. 28, however, requires an interpretation of
terms such as “cloning,” “human being,” “germline genetic identity” “use of human embryos” and “industrial or
commercial purposes.” Courts have not yet exhaustively clarified these terms, but there is common understanding
that the terms “cloning process” refer to the process of creating a cell or organism with the same nuclear genome as
another cell or organism (EPO Guidelines, 2018, Part G, Chapter II, 5.3). It should be noted here that patent law is not
concerned with the morality of the invention, but with the morality of the commercial exploitation of the invention.
This means that if a human being were cloned, patent law would deem its “commercial exploitation” as immoral, not
the cloned human being. There are two different types of cloning, reproductive and therapeutic cloning. The first aims
at making an entire cloned human, while the second clones human cells for transplants and other medical uses. Two
common methods of therapeutic cloning are somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and pluripotent stem cell induction.
Reproductive cloning and cells obtained by the SCNT method are not currently patentable in Europe19 but induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be patented. The interpretation of this provision is yet uncertain because there is no
legal definition of the status of “human being” and it is not clear whether the human embryo can be deemed a human
being (Vo v France).

The terms “human being” are also relevant for interpreting the ban on “processes for modifying the germline
genetic identity of human beings.” This provision refers to processes that introduce heritable changes into the human
genome. For example, the CRISPR-Cas9 technique could potentially be used to correct DNA sequences responsible
for causing genetic diseases. The genetic modifications introduced by CRISPR-Cas9 are transmissible over
generations. This is considered to be against “ordre public” and “morality.” Likewise, “uses of human embryos for
industrial or commercial purposes” are deemed immoral under R. 28. Although the meaning of these terms may appear
quite straightforward, they have been subject to interpretation. For instance, the Expert Group on patent law (Expert
Group, p. 146) elaborates on three meanings of the term “use”: strict, middle, and widest. The “strict meaning” refers to
the direct use of human embryos in the inventive process, the “middle meaning” involves an invention obtained by
destroying the human embryo, whereas the “widest meaning” implies a “process or substance which depends on a
prior, ‘upstream’ non-destructive use of a human embryo.” The majority of the members of the Expert Group conclude
that only those inventions that require the direct use of human embryos and of processes that destroy human
embryos are excluded from patentability, whereas two dissenting members argue that any use of human embryos
should be excluded from patentability. With respect to the purpose of embryo use, the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU)20 has clarified that any use of the human embryo is excluded from patentability unless the use
of the invention is “for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes which are applied to the human embryo and are useful to
it” (Oliver Brüstle v Greenpeace eV). This definition may add to legal uncertainty since it does not clarify the meaning

of “useful.” It would be important to explain whether the utility of the invention contributes to the embryo per se and/
or to the development of the embryo in order to understand the type of inventions that can be deemed patentable.
There is also no agreement on the scientific understanding of “embryo.” In this case, lack of clarity does not
necessarily have negative effects. The provisions on patent law are closely linked to scientific developments. Since the
field of hESC inventions is in rapid progress, it may be desirable to avoid a static definition of “human embryo.” Indeed,
the CJEU changed the definition of human embryo from a wide concept in the Brüstle case to a narrower one in the
International Stem Cell Corporation case. The understanding of “human embryo” in Brüstle was coined as:

any human ovum after fertilisation, any non-fertilised human ovum into which the cell nucleus from a
mature human cell has been transplanted and any non-fertilised human ovum whose division and further
development have been stimulated by parthenogenesis constitute a ‘human embryo’ within the meaning of
Article 6(2)(c) of the Directive;

In the International Stem Cell Corporation case, the CJEU judges excluded a non-fertilized human ovum whose
division and further development have been stimulated by parthenogenesis from the concept of human embryo. The
exclusion was justified by the fact that, in light of the current scientific knowledge, a human parthenote as such is not
“capable of commencing the process of development which leads to a human being.” The reference to “current
scientific understanding” is important because it highlights how the law is influenced by scientific developments.
When science is in continuous evolution, legal interpretation navigates uncertain waters. In both cases, the CJEU
argued that it is upon national courts to decide “whether a stem cell obtained from a human embryo at the blastocyst
stage constitutes a ‘human embryo’ within the meaning of Article 6(2)(c) of the Directive.” It appears that the judges
took account of the different understandings of “human embryo” under national European laws. In addition to
defining the concept of “human embryo,” the CJEU judges reiterated the reasoning of EPO decisions on morally
acceptable hESC inventions. In Europe, only hESC inventions that are obtained by not destroying the blastocyst are
patentable.

The rationale of this exclusion is strongly linked to the supremacy of human dignity as clarified in Use of embryos/
WARF. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) claimed products “prepared exclusively by a method
which necessarily involved the destruction of the human embryos from which the said products are derived, even if
the said method is not part of the claims.” The EPO explained that the intended purpose of the rules on
biotechnological inventions is to preserve human dignity (Sterckx & Cobain, 2012, p. 286) and the rationale of R. 28, in
specific, is to prohibit misuse or commodification of the embryo. The EPO ruled that the invention violates the
prohibition of Rule 28(c) since the destruction of the human embryo is an integral and essential part of the industrial or
commercial exploitation of the claimed invention. Although the Enlarged Boards of Appeal in the WARF case offered
no definition of “human dignity,”21 it confirmed the respect for human dignity as one of the primary objectives of EU
law. The safeguard of human dignity was previously explained by the Court of Justice of the European Union in case
377/98 (Kingdom of the Netherlands). The Advocate General observed the following:

The right to human dignity is recognized by nearly all Contracting States and also the ECJ as a fundamental
right. The human body is the vehicle for human dignity. Making living human matter an instrument is not
acceptable from the point of view of human dignity. The right to human dignity is perhaps the most
fundamental right of all, and is now expressed in Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union, which states that human dignity is inviolable and must be respected and protected
(emphasis added).

Some authors argue that the wording in the “Use of embryos/WARF” decision, “implies that if a product is
produced by a production method which initially involves the destruction of hESC then if further production
(incubation of the cell culture) does not require further destruction of hESCs after the patent application filing

date, patentability would not be precluded,” and therefore, human dignity would not be violated. At present, the
EPO does not deem immoral patents on hESC filed after 5 June 2003. This is the date when a protocol to derive
human parthenogenetic embryonic stem (hpES) cells from activated oocytes (parthenotes) was disclosed in the
PCT application WO 03/046141 (Advanced Cell Technology). After this date, patent filings on “inventions relating
to human pluripotent stem cells including hES cells, to their uses and to products derived from them are patentable
(subject to fulfilling all patentability criteria) on the basis that these may be produced and put into practice using a
method which does not involve destroying a human embryo” (Expert Group, p. 145).22 Based on statutory
prohibitions and legal decisions, the following table gives an overview of the current state of patentability in
Europe (Table 1).23

Nevertheless, patentability of hESC research is far from certain for two main reasons. The first reason
pertains to the continuous evolution of science, while the second to judicial interpretation which is influenced
by several actors. In Europe, for example, third parties24 have often advanced many arguments against patents
on hESCs concerning mainly the monopoly effects of patent rights and informed consent of genetic material
extracted from the human body. These arguments have not been substantiated (Rennie-Smith, 2018/2019) and
have rarely been considered by the Boards of Appeal. The EPO has clarified that it has not been vested with the
“task of taking into account the economic effects of the grant of patents in specific areas of technology and of
restricting the field of patentable subject-matter accordingly.”25 Similarly,
the EPO has declared its
incompetence to decide on informed consent since the EPC does not provide for such provisions (T-272/95
If third parties’ arguments were sufficiently substantiated, they may further limit the
and T-666/05).
patentability of hESC inventions. This, however, will depend on the type of invention. One reason that may
justify this interpretation is the necessity to interpret exclusions from patentability in order to give effect to
their purpose (Treatment by surgery/MEDI-PHYSICS, Para. 3.1). A narrow or a broad interpretation can be
adopted depending on the interests at stake. For example, if the purpose of the exclusion is deemed to be the
safeguard of human dignity, no inventions that destroy human embryos should be allowed. If the purpose of the
exclusion is the protection of human life (and the embryo is not considered to be “human life”), inventions that
imply the destruction of human embryos could be patentable.

This suggestion on the interpretation of “ordre public” and “morality” may add to legal uncertainty. In the area of
patent law, “it is especially important that the law remain stable and clear” (Bently et al., 2010, p. 61). Indeed, the
vagueness of law creates incentives to overcome legal hurdles through skillful drafting. This situation raises
transaction costs and as mentioned in the beginning of this paper, it may damage the competitiveness of firms in the
market. Different interpretations of the public policy clause may also facilitate the lack of public's trust in the patent
system. Therefore, it is imperative to explore options that offer legal certainty.

4 | EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR ASSESSING “ORDRE PUBLIC” AND
“MORALITY” IN PATENT LAW FOR hESC INVENTIONS

A suggestion to offer legal certainty for hESC inventions may appear more as a brave proposal rather than a pragmatic
solution. This is because the concepts of “ordre public” and “morality” are subject to change over time and it is not
possible to have a common understanding of the terms even at a particular point in time. Patents on life forms are an
example of significant divergence with respect to the morality criterion. While most of the European society strongly
opposes patents on life forms and the modification of human germline,26 there have been no similar reactions in other
jurisdictions. The reasons for these views may be founded on various religious and philosophical concepts,27 but it
may be worth drawing our attention to the dichotomy between those that contrast patents on any life form based on
the belief that life is sacred and those that accept the patentability of biological material driven by the intention to
realize social goals. Depending on the interests at stake, the last category may be composed of a plurality of actors
with different views on the type of subject matter to be excluded from patentability. Some may deem hESC inventions
obtained through the destruction of human embryos non-patentable, others may not see the destruction of human
embryos as a limit to patentability and may further opt to extend patentability to human genome modification.

The idea of value pluralism considers all these views valid and incommensurable (Isaiah Berlin, 2016). Indeed, they
are all important given that societal wellbeing is determined by the welfare of its individuals. However, when
legislative and judicial bodies are invited to decide on the matter, they need to compare different values. A common
denominator for hESC inventions may be found in the objective to improve healthcare. Given that ethics permeates all
body of law (Moufang. 1994, pp. 487–515) and it is present in the concepts of “ordre public” and “morality” (Sterckx &
Cobain, 2012, p. 297), it appears reasonable to propose that ethics as a “a set of concepts and principles that guide us
in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures” (Paul & Elder, 2013) serves as a yardstick for
assessing hESC inventions against “ordre public” and “morality.” Ethics is a means to distinguish between bad and good
laws and helps determine morality, les bonnes mœurs, what is especially good. Since the primary aim of hESC
inventions is to improve healthcare, in terms of the issue at hand, ethics can be found in human rights and in universally
accepted principles. The human right to health, often coined also as the right to receive healthcare (Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and World Health Organization, 2018) has been enumerated in
several international instruments such as the preamble of the Constitution of the World Health Organization, art. 25
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, art. 24 of the Rights of the Child, art. 5 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, art.
12 and 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and art. 25 of the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Countries may refer to the potential of hESC inventions to
realize the right to health as “the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and
mental health” as provided for in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in order
to justify the patentability of controversial research. This may be the case of human genome modification experiments
in China conducted with the aim to find a cure for cancer (Rana, Dockser Marcus, & Wexin, 2018). The patentability of
germline therapy is another example. Some countries allow it, others prohibit it a priori, under embryo protection laws
(Germany), or constitutional bans (Switzerland), whereas “others consider it ethically unacceptable at current levels of
understanding, not per se” (Schatz, 1998). This raises the question of the extent to which the right to health should
prevail.

Human dignity may represent a limit. For example, a life-saving invention obtained by destroying human embryos
would be prohibited.28 Human dignity is reiterated in the EPO and CJEU decisions on hESC inventions. The Japan
Patent Office has also affirmed the protection of human dignity as a public policy objective (Trial against Examiner's
Decision of Refusal 2008–7386). The protection of human dignity of unborn embryos may appear unreasonable when
compared with the potential of hESC inventions to save lives. In this regard, it is worth noting that the legal status of
the embryo is determinant for deciding on the matter. There is no doubt that in addition to law, science and national
public policies influence the interpretation of the public policy clause. Whereas it is upon governments to direct

10

scientific developments for the benefit of society, the types of advantages that hESC inventions bring to the society
will depend on the interests at stake. The vagueness of the terms “ordre public” and “morality” accommodate all of the
interests involved and it may be unreasonable to provide a static definition of the terms. However, research involving
hESC is a global concern because of its importance in personalized, precision and regenerative medicine. Investments
both from the public and the private sector are on the rise and studies show that the global market for hESC research
will reach two billion USD by 2020 (Global Industry Analysts, Inc., 2017). If an invention happens in one country, it will
undoubtedly be distributed in other countries. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to propose some principles that
provide guidance in understanding the public policy clause. Commonly accepted values as a guide on the patentability
of hESC inventions can be found in soft law international instruments such as the UNESCO Universal Declaration on
the Human Genome and Human Rights, and the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.
These international legal instruments set the limits for the evolution of science in line with a concept of ethics that
helps humanity advance. In specific, art. 11 of the UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human
Rights prohibits reproductive cloning of human beings as a practice contrary to human dignity. Current patent laws
comply with this provision. Art. 3 of the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights further
explains that “human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms are to be fully respected” and “the interests and
welfare of the individual should have priority over the sole interest of science or society.” The primacy of the human
being and prohibitions on the intervention on the human genome are also affirmed in the Oviedo Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine:
Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine binding for all EU member states. Art. 12 and art. 14 of this Convention
establish that predictive genetic tests should be performed only for health purposes and the use of techniques of
medically assisted procreation shall be allowed only if “serious hereditary sex-related disease is to be avoided.” It
appears thus that relevant limits for hESC inventions in international law are the ban on human genome modification
and the welfare of the individual over the interest of science or society.

Another option for an evaluation of “ordre public” and “morality” may be the examination of scientific guidelines
developed by national science foundations and guidelines on hESC research elaborated by public bodies. This route was
followed by the Japan Patent Office in Trial against Examiner's Decision of Refusal 2008–7386, where several scientific
national and international documents were cited.29 The Asilomar Conference and its recommendations on experiments
with recombinant DNA and ban on cloning have been followed by the scientific community for a long time (Fredrickson,
1991). Therefore, it appears reasonable that patent judges include scientific evaluations in their decisions.

Given different levels of socio–economic development between WTO countries, it is not wise to recommend a
uniform understanding of the public policy clause at present. But the above analysis allows us to give some general
recommendations for conducting a test of “ordre public” and “morality” based on art. 27.2. The test may involve two
steps. The first step should reply to the following question: Is the patent rejection necessary30 to end the offence? If
there are alternative measures to stop the offence against “ordre public” and “morality,” a ban on patentability will be
of no use. If there are no alternatives to stop the offence, patent judges should assess whether the commercial
exploitation of the invention is against “ordre public” and “morality.” The investigation of this question should first
examine laws, regulations and scientific guidelines of national public authorities, then consider international soft or
hard law instruments, and finally examine the purpose and use of hESCs in relation with domestic public policy. If the
purpose and use of hESCs promote the public policy objective of healthcare and do not harm the individual, the
invention should be considered patentable.

5 | CONCLUSIONS

The inclusion of the “ordre public” and “morality” clause in patent law serves as a means to guide scientific
developments for the benefit of society. As explained in this paper, patent offices have important regulatory functions
and the inclusion of a public policy clause in patent law is not a surprise.31 The interpretative difficulty linked with

value judgments enclosed in the terms of “ordre public” and “morality,” however, encumbers the work of patent
offices. The current interpretation of the public policy clause for hESC inventions is filled with legal uncertainty on the
definition of scientific terms. Indeed, it is not easy to hem scientific developments in a legal definition. This paper
argues that in some cases it may be preferable to adopt flexible definitions but a global interest in healthcare
innovations may require a common understanding of “ordre public” and “morality” in the long run. To this purpose, it
was suggested that ethics as a set of values should determine the bonnes mœurs, what is good for society. The set of
common values was found in international legal instruments and scientific guidelines that prohibit human cloning and
put the welfare of the individual over the interest of science or society. At present, the concept of human dignity
appears to set important limits for the patentability of hESC inventions. But these limits are subject to interpretation.
Science is in continuous evolution and the question is not whether society or law will follow, but at what pace.

ENDNOTES

1 This is a science fiction movie representing a future society driven by eugenics.
2 It is worth noting here that there exists a market for human genome modification. See better Fox (2008), pp. 162–166.
3 The importance of hESC in research remains even after the invention of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by Prof.
Yamanaka. Although iPSC circumvent the problem of embryo destruction, hESC are still relevant for conducting similarity
tests (to evaluate their similarity with iPSC) and for studying diseases. As confirmed during interviews with scientists
(Friederike Matheus and Micha Drukker of Helmholtz Centrum in Munich, December 2016) the performance of iPSC and
hESC varies in base of the object and purpose of research.

4 Please, note that the blastocyst is a distinctive stage of the embryo. For a scientific definition of “blastocyst” see

Encyclopedia Britannica.

5 Prior to the TRIPS Agreement, the clause was originally inserted into national patent laws and in the text of the EPC. For
more see Sterckx and Cockbain, (2012), pp. 23–24, p. 289. For the clause in the TRIPS Agreement see Gervais (2008) pp.
334–350.

amendment.

7 For an understanding of legal hurdles see Furman, (2013), pp. 230–233.
8 This may happen because less competition in the market might reduce the transfer and dissemination of technology as

required in art. 7 of the TRIPS Agreement.

to be prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment.

11 In particular, it refers to the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO) reasoning in T 315/03, Oncomouse, para

4.4. See p. 44 of Bently et al. (2010).

12 For a better understanding of the restrictions set in art. 27.2 see, Correa (2016), pp. 267–268.
13 It has been affirmed in T 0356/93 (Plant cells) of 21.2.1995 that “The EPO being at the crossroads between science and

public policy, was qualified to make value judgements about a given technology.”

14 The foundations of the concept can be found in the “boni mores” in Roman law. For an understanding of the concept see

Zimmermann (1996), pp. 706–715.

15 For more explanations see The Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 8th ed,/July 2016,
available at https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/caselaw/2016/e/clr_i_b_2_2_2_b.htm. Accessed 14
February 2018.

16 The results are based on a search performed on the Boards of Appeal database, http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-
law-appeals/advanced-search.html, last accessed 27 January 2018. The search terms were “52(a)” in the box “EPC article”
for the period 1989–2018. Please, note that although the results page displays 36 cases, some concern the same case
published in different languages.

17 For example, in the Oncomouse case, T 0315/03 (Transgenic animals/HARVARD) of 6.7.2004, the judges adopted a
utilitarian understanding of the clause and allowed the patentability of the transgenic mouse. In another case, they used the
test to reject an application claiming a transgenic mouse for screening hair growth stimulants.

18 The EPC incorporates the provisions of the Directive 98/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6
July 1998 on the Legal Protection of biotechnological inventions. Although their provisions apply to different jurisdictions,
they are highly harmonized.

19 SCNT cells are patentable in other jurisdictions. For instance, Japan grants patent rights on SCNT for therapeutic purposes.
20 To be noted that the decisions of the CJEU apply only to EU countries, but the EPO follows CJEU's decision for the sake of

substantive harmonization in patent law. For more see Pila and Torremans (2016), p. 129.

21 For a study on the meaning of the concept see Beyleveld and Brownsword (2001).
22 In addition, the EPO clarified that patent claims should be examined in combination with the “technical teaching of the
application as a whole as to how the invention is to be performed.” This reasoning appeared necessary in order to avoid
patent prohibitions by clever and skillful drafting.

23 The US and Japan patent laws allow for more types of patentable hESC inventions.
24 Patents granted by the EPO may be opposed before the EPO within nine months of the publication of the mention that the

patent has been granted.

25 See, for instance, G 1/98 Reasons 3.9 and T 1213/05. In T-666/05, the EPO adopted skilful legal drafting to distinguish
between “exploitation of the patent” and “exploitation of the invention.” Since art. 53 (a) refers to “exploitation of the
invention,” the judges argued that the negative effects of the patent could not fall under the wording of the provision.
26 In the Oncomouse case, polls showed the contrariety of Europeans to animal patents. The initiatives “Kein Patent auf
Leben!” and “No Patents on Seeds” represent an umbrella of organizations in Europe against life forms. The opposition to
patents on modification of human germline is mainly related to eugenics fears.

27 To be noted the humanist inheritance of the European Union as stated in the preamble of the Consolidated version of the

Treaty on the European Union, pp. 15–16.

28 This is a hypothetical case. If hESC inventions were filed after 5 June 2003, patent offices would deem the inventions

patentable.
