Is a domain name property?
Sheldon Burshtein*

Domain names have become increasingly valuable
assets,
in some respects more valuable than trade
marks. A domain name may identify not only the
source of the goods, services, business, or informa-
tion, but also the virtual
location of the source,
much as an address or telephone number does. How-
ever, there is still a significant unresolved issue as to
whether a domain name is a form of intangible prop-
erty or merely a contractual right. Resolution of this
issue is important for commercial transactions affect-
ing domain names and for legal proceedings and
remedies relating to them. Although US appellate
authority holds that a domain name is a form of
intangible intellectual property,1 it is submitted that
the better, but not
judicially clear or consistent,
view is that a domain name is not property.2 This
position is reflected in the .ca registry, where, in regis-
tering a domain name, the registrant agrees, as a con-
tractual condition of registration, that it acquires no
property right in the domain name.3

1. Characterization of domain
names
A domain name is a character string that, when entered
on a browser, enables one to download material from a
remote server associated with the Internet protocol
(IP) address to which the domain name resolves. The
registrant can cause the domain name to resolve to a
particular IP address and can elect to change the IP
address to which the domain name resolves. This
functionality is common to all domain names and is
the defining characteristic of a domain name.4

 Domain names may be greatly valued by their
owners and large sums of money may be paid
for them, but that does not of itself mean that
they are â€˜propertyâ€™.

 While there is some authority under United
States law to suggest that domain names are
property, it is submitted that the better view is
that
they are not property but are instead
merely contractual rights.

 Domain name registration authorities have
adopted different policies when dealing with
proprietary issues relating to them.

 Some guidance as to the legal nature of domain
names may be derived from a comparison with
the legal status of telephone numbers.

In attempts to answer the fundamental question of
whether a domain name registration is property or
merely a contractual right flowing from a registration
agreement, domain names have been analogized by
courts to addresses,5 patents,6 trade marks,7 and
even by one writer to cattle.8 However,
in this
authorâ€™s view, the best way to characterize the legal
status of a domain name is by analogy to a telephone
number. A sequence of electronically generated sig-
nals, assigned by the operator of a telephone utility
to a subscriber, enables the subscriberâ€™s instrument
to be contacted for sound, text, and graphics from
another instrument in the network. An alphanumeric
telephone number corresponds to the sequence of
electrical signals needed to contact the instrument.

A subscriber can ask the telephone company to asso-
ciate the telephone number to a specific location.

In some respects, domain names are even more
akin to toll-free vanity telephone numbers9 such as
1-800-HOLIDAY. The analogy is appropriate because
a domain name is a mnemonic for the unwieldy ini-
tial portion of a numerical address. The mnemonic
device is often related to a business name or a trade
mark and may be the basis of a substantial advertising
investment. Each represents a scarce public resource
in that the unique nature of vanity numbers and
domain names means that only a limited number of
each is available. Finally, the continued right to use
a vanity number or a domain name is dependent on
the continuation of services from the telephone car-
rier or domain name registry. One of the first United
States domain name decisions provides some valida-
tion for this characterization.10 The court analogized
Internet domain names
to telephone number
mnemonics. Other US decisions have followed this
approach.11 US courts have consistently held that
telephone subscribers have no proprietary rights in
the numbers assigned by telephone companies.12

subscriber from those of others.13 However, in Can-
ada the traditional trade mark law requirement of
distinctiveness means that a telephone number must
distinguish the source of goods or services if it is to
be entitled to trade mark protection.14 Over time a
telephone number may, through use as a trade mark
to distinguish goods, services, or business activities,
acquire trade mark significance to the point where it
can be registered15 or where rights can be enforced at
common law.16 The same is true for a domain name.
In registering a domain name, a registrant con-
tracts for a defined period of time for the right to dir-
ect how a domain name is resolved. The registrant
receives only the conditional contractual right to the
exclusive association of the registered domain name
with a given IP address for the term of the registra-
tion.17 The registrant does not, through its contract
with a domain name registry, obtain any right against
any other person, other than the de facto consequent
exclusivity resulting from the fact that the identical
domain name may not be registered or used by
another person during the term of the registration.
No right exists separate and apart from the contract
with the registry.18 In this authorâ€™s view, any â€˜owner-
shipâ€™ of a domain name is therefore merely a contrac-
tual right, incidental to registration, to direct how a
character string will resolve when a user enters the
name on a browser.19

has also held that a domain name is not a property
right.22 In these decisions, for the most part, reliance
has been placed on the telephone number analogy.
Some decisions acknowledge that telephone numbers
constitute unique property interests. However,
in
what was until recently the leading case on the ques-
tion of whether a domain name is property,23 the
court chose to follow a line of cases holding that tele-
phone numbers are neither the property of, nor in the
possession of, telephone subscribers. Instead the court
characterized a domain name as the product of a con-
tract.24 It has been held that, in the .com registry, a
domain name registrant only has a contract with its
registrar,
rights being governed
exclusively by the service agreement with the regis-
trar.25 Courts have declined to order the seizure of a
domain name, saying that a domain name is not
property.26 It has also been held that the improper
transfer of a domain name cannot constitute the
tort of conversion because a domain name is not
property.27

registrantâ€™s

the

However, several appellate decisions may have
clouded the issue. In Porsche Cars North America v
Porsche.Net,28 the Fourth Circuit interpreted the in
rem jurisdiction provisions of the Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act (ACPA).29 The defendant
challenged the in rem jurisdiction of the ACPA30 to
escape the application of the statute on the basis
that a domain name is only an address and not prop-
erty. The court relied on an earlier decision, unrelated
to the ACPA, which rejected the position that a
domain name is nothing more than an address.
That decision, which was rendered under the pre-
ACPA Lanham Act, said only that a domain name
was not merely an address in the context of the court
determining whether the defendant was using the
domain name as a trade mark.31 The court then
went on to say that â€˜Congress plainly treated domain
names as property in the ACPAâ€™ (emphasis added).32

However, the court did not hold that a domain name
is property.

The ACPA, which authorizes an in rem civil action
against a domain name, may suggest that a domain
name is intangible property, since an in rem action
is traditionally brought to determine the status of
specific property.33 However, the ACPA does not
address the relationship between a domain name
registration and the contract with the registry. Fur-
ther, while the ACPA provides for an in rem action,
the legislation does not state that a domain name is
property. Since a domain name registration does
not exist separately from the registrantâ€™s contract, it
is submitted that no property right attaches to the
domain name or to the registration on its own.34
The ACPA merely permits the availability of in rem
jurisdiction because of the difficulties in obtaining
in personam jurisdiction over cyberpirates. This is
made clear by the fact that one of the conditions for
in rem jurisdiction under the ACPA is that a trade
mark owner be unable either to obtain in personam
jurisdiction over, or to locate, the defendant.35 Thus
the ACPAâ€™s in rem jurisdiction is merely a procedural
technique. It is submitted that Porsche merely stands
for the proposition that,
for ACPA purposes, a
domain name is subject to in rem jurisdiction as if
it were property.

claim to exclusivity. The court therefore held that a
domain name is subject to the tort of conversion
under California law, even though it is intangible
property.37 The decision must, though, be considered
in its context. The plaintiff sued to regain control
the extremely valuable sex.com domain name
of
from the
who
misappropriated the domain name registration by
sending a forged letter to the registrar, NSI. The trial
court rejected the claim, holding that the improper
transfer of a domain name cannot constitute the
tort of conversion because a domain name is not
property.38 On appeal, the court held that a domain
name is a form of intangible property, ordering the
defendant to transfer the domain name registration
and awarding damages against NSI.39 The plaintiff
subsequently settled against VeriSign, the successor
to NSI.40 This decision followed an earlier one in
the same circuit in which, on a jurisdictional ques-
tion, the court assumed that a domain name could
be converted.41

In the United States, therefore, the current but not
uniform view appears to be that a domain name is a
form of intangible property which is protected by
the tort of conversion because (i) a domain name
represents an interest of precise definition, (ii) a
domain name is subject to exclusive possession of
control, and (iii) a registrant has a legitimate claim
to exclusivity in a domain name.42 However, a more
recent intermediate appellate decision has held that
a domain name is not personal property unless
registered as a trade mark.43

3. Canada
Canadian courts have not yet fully or properly con-
sidered the question, but they have equally clouded
the issue. The Ontario Superior Court has suggested
in obiter comments that a domain name, while

difficult to characterize as real or personal property,
could be characterized as intangible property.44 In
Easthaven Ltd v Nutrisystem.com Inc 45 the plaintiff,
a Barbadian corporation, was the registrant of the
domain name sweetsuccess.com. The domain name
incorporated in Delaware, had its head
registrar,
office in Ontario. The defendant,
incorporated in
Delaware and having its principal place of business
in Ontario, owned a family of SWEET SUCCESS
trade marks. The plaintiff offered to sell the domain
name to the defendant. The defendant sued the
plaintiff and the registrar in Pennsylvania, where the
trade mark owner obtained a preliminary injunction
against transfer of the domain name. The plaintiff
then sued in Ontario. The action against the registrar
was discontinued when it placed the domain name
â€˜on holdâ€™. The defendant moved to dismiss the
Ontario action. The court stayed the Ontario action,
suggesting that a domain name, while difficult to
characterize as real or personal property, could be
characterized as intangible property.

of its Rule 377 of the Federal Court Rules 199846 or
that the rule may be applied to support an order to

owner of the trade marks MOLSON and MOLSONâ€™S,

against the defendant, who had registered the domain
names molson.com and molsonbeer.com. The court

control over
domain names into the registry of the court. After
determining that the motion was brought pursuant
to Rule 377, the court concluded that it was not clear
that
intellectual property is â€˜propertyâ€™ within the
meaning of Rule 377 or that the rule may be applied
to support an order to preserve intellectual property
rights. Further, the plaintiff failed to meet the test
applicable under Rule 377, which is the same test as
for an interlocutory injunction. While some may sug-
gest
implicitly considered that a
domain name is property, the court did not so hold.
At most, the court effectively said that, even if a
domain name might be intellectual property, it was
not clear that Rule 377 applied.

With respect to domain names registered in the .ca
registry, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority
(CIRA) Registrant Agreement provides that the regis-
trant expressly agrees
the registration of a
domain name does not create any proprietary right
for the registrant, a registrar, or any other person, in
any name used as a domain name or in any registra-
tion, and that the entry of a domain name in the
WHOIS database of the CIRA registry is not to be
construed as evidence of ownership of the registered
domain name.49 The registrant must not transfer or
purport to transfer a proprietary right in any registra-
tion or grant or purport to grant as security, or in any
other manner encumber or purport to encumber, any
domain name registration.50 Thus, at least in the .ca

registry, by virtue of the contractual terms underlying
a registration, the registrant of a domain name clearly
obtains no property right in the domain name or its
registration.

4. Other jurisdictions
A German court has held that a domain name is pro-
perty granted pursuant to a contract, but that the right
to use the property is subject to certain obligations
and duties which are subject to trade mark law.51

5. Conclusion
The decisions in the United States and Canada illus-
trate that there is still a significant unresolved issue
as to whether a domain name is a form of intangible
property or merely a contractual right. Resolution of
this issue is important for commercial transactions
affecting domain names and for legal proceedings
and remedies relating to them. Although there is Uni-
ted States appellate authority to the effect that a
domain name is a form of
intangible intellectual
property,52 it is submitted that the better, but not
judicially clear or consistent, view is that a domain
name is not property. However, despite the number
and value of domain names, this issue is not likely
to be settled for a while, and even then may be
resolved differently in each jurisdiction.
