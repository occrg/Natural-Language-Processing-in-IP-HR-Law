in procedure. First, the requirements for assessing
patentability have been tightened up. In the UK,
the former test attempting to identify a technical
contribution was carried out
in isolation from
considerations of
inventive step. This meant that
any advantage provided by the invention in a tech-
nical
field could be put forward by a practioner
as an argument that a ‘technical contribution’ had
been made, even if the advantage identified was sepa-
rate from the features of the invention that made the
invention novel. The inventive concept itself could be
in an excluded field. An advantage provided by the
invention will, however, no longer provide an argu-
ment that subject-matter is patentable unless it stems
directly from that part of the claimed subject-matter
that is alleged to be new and inventive.

Although there seems to be no direct relationship

UK perspective, the UK practice notice does exactly

bring the Patent Office’s approach to excluded matter
in line with that in the European Patent Office, and
hopefully provide clarity for applicants and prac-
tioners. Not all change is unwelcome!

tion) Act 1995

A look at the London Olympics Bill in so far as it
seeks to prevent ambush marketing and protect
use of the Olympic intellectual property

the host

Legal context and facts
On 6 July 2005 the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) chose London as
for the 2012
Olympic and Paralympic Games. The ‘Host City
Contract’ subsequently signed by the British Olympic
Association and the Mayor of London requires the
UK to ‘meet the requirements of the International
Olympic Committee to effectively reduce ambush
marketing . . . and control advertising during Games
time’.

To that end, the London Olympics Bill was pre-
sented to the House of Commons on 14 July 2005,
published on 15 July 2005, debated in Standing Com-
mittee, and amended on 18 October 2005. It deals in
particular with regulation of advertising activities and
commercial exploitation in connection with the
Games and protection of the Olympic intellectual
property such as the Olympic symbol, motto, and
associated words.

Ambush marketing This is defined by the IOC
as ‘a planned attempt by a third party to associate
itself directly or indirectly with the Olympic Games
to gain the recognition and benefits associated with
being an Olympic partner’.

Ambush marketing is neither a new phenomenon,
although it has received increasing publicity in recent
years, nor is it restricted to the Olympics or indeed
to sporting events. The Sundance Film Festival in Jan-
uary 2005 was said by the Sundance Institute to be
awash with ambush marketing alongside official
sponsors
such as Volkswagen, Hewlett-Packard,
American Express, and Sony.

Ambush marketing is often seen as parasitic,
unethical, and a form of ‘free-riding’ since it involves
unauthorized association with an event without
payment of
the official sponsorship fees. Official
sponsors invariably pay huge sums for the privilege
of being allowed to associate themselves with events,
for example by displaying their brands on advertising
hoardings and selling branded merchandise at official
venues. The official sponsors of the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics
reportedly paid over US$40 million
each while the total sponsorship fees for the Sydney
Olympics 2000 were in the region of US$700 million.
Expenditure of such large sums is no guarantee
against ambush marketing however. Anheuser-Busch
paid over US$50 million to become the official spon-
sor of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City
with its ‘Whassup’ advertising campaign, only for a
small
to use the
phrase ‘Wasatch. The Unofficial Beer. 2002 Winter
Games’. Similarly, when Visa sponsored the 1994
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, American
Express ran an advertising campaign stating that
Americans would need a passport but not a Visa. At
the Sydney Olympics 2000, Qantas Airlines used the
slogan ‘The Spirit of Australia’ in the face of Ansett
Air, the official sponsor, using the slogan ‘Share the
Spirit’.

local company, Schirf Brewery,

Ambush marketing can be highly successful. A sur-
vey carried out less than a month after the 1996
Atlanta Olympics asked respondents to name six
companies associated with the Olympics. The result:
54% named American Express while 72% named
Visa. The official sponsor was Visa but, as the results
show, American Express achieved high recognition
without paying hefty sponsorship fees. So too did
Nike, again not an official sponsor. Similarly, in a
survey carried out some months before the Sydney
Olympics 2000, 58% of respondents named Qantas
Airlines as an official sponsor while only 38% named
the actual sponsor, Ansett Air.

It is now commonplace for legislation to be imple-
mented ahead of major events in attempts to prevent
ambush marketing. The objectives of doing so are
to protect the financial investment made by official
sponsors and maximize the return to organisers of
the event which, without official sponsorship, would
be unlikely
to take place. Wide-ranging pro-
visions proposed for the 2012 Olympics are discussed
below.

Analysis
London Olympics Bill 2005 The London
Olympics Bill
is considered first as it deals with
restrictions on advertising and then with protection
of the Olympic intellectual property.

(1) Restrictions on Advertizing The Bill provides
that the Secretary of State is to make regulations on
advertising in the vicinity of London Olympic events.
These are to

(i) state the places where, and the nature of advertis-
ing to which, the regulations apply, plus what is
to be treated as advertising within the vicinity
of such a place;

(ii) apply to advertising of any kind, including non-
commercial advertising and announcements or
notices of any kind;

(iii) apply to advertising in any form, including distri-
bution/provision of documents or articles, dis-
play or projection of words,
lights or
sounds, and things done with or in relation to
material which has or may have purposes/uses
other than as an advertisement;

images,

(iv) specify the period during which they are to apply
(this may only be for such time as considered
necessary to comply with the Host City Contract.
This period may vary with the venue);

(v) allow ‘a responsible body’ to control advertising
and authorize others to undertake advertising in
relation to the London Olympics;

(vi) impose obligations on those who advertise with-
out authorization or obtain a benefit from such
advertising—this could include owners and occu-
piers of premises or those responsible for such
premises.

Failure to comply with the regulations will be a
criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to
£20,000 on summary conviction in the magistrate’s
court. This is significantly higher than the current
maximum of £5,000. It is a defence to prove that
the regulations were breached without the accused’s
knowledge or despite his
reasonable
the breach from occurring or
steps
continuing.

ranging, especially that relating to ‘advertising of

any kind including non-commercial advertising and
announcements or notices of any kind’. To some
degree, these are not surprising given past occur-
rences. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, for example,
Nike advertised extensively on billboards and a Nike
hospitality facility and retail outlet was
set up
adjacent to the official Olympic hospitality facility.
Airspace above and around Olympic venues is also
useful to ambush marketers and will be controlled
by the proposed regulations as it was during the
Sydney Olympics 2000. The overall objective is to
create a ‘clean city’.

(2) Protection of Olympic Intellectual Property It
is necessary here to look first at The Olympic Symbol
etc (Protection) Act 1995 (‘the Olympic Act’) and
then at changes made to it by the Bill.

The Olympic Symbol etc (Protection) Act
1995 The Olympic Symbol etc (Protection) Act
1995 created ‘the Olympics association right’ by
which use in the course of trade of the Olympic
(five rings) symbol, the Olympic motto, and pro-
tected words (essentially variations on ‘Olympic’
such as ‘Olympian’ and ‘Olympiad’) is prohibited
by anyone other than the owner of the right (at
present the British Olympic Association), whether
in English or in translation. The Olympics association
right also prohibits the use in the course of trade
of a representation so similar
to the Olympic
symbol or the Olympic motto as to be likely to
create an association with them in the mind of the
public.

Use of the prohibited symbol or motto or a sym-
bol/motto similar to these or of the protected words
(together defined as ‘a controlled representation’)
constitutes infringement and is actionable as such.

‘Use’ is defined in line with the Trade Marks Act
1994 (‘the Trade Marks Act’) as use on goods or their
packaging, offering or exposing for sale, importing,
exporting and, use on business papers or in advertis-
ing. Use is also, importantly, to include use in a flag
or banner.

There are a number of defences to infringement,

the main ones arising where

(ii) the use creates an association which fairly repre-
sents a connection between the Olympic Games
or movement and any person/thing provided
the use is in accordance with honest practices in
industrial or commercial matters;

(iii) a controlled representation is used in a literary,
dramatic, musical, or artistic work or in a sound
recording, film, broadcast, or cable programme
provided that either there is no use in relation
to goods or services or the user does not intend
these to be used in relation to goods or services
in circumstances which would infringe
the
Olympics association right and, in each case, the
use is in accordance with honest practices in
industrial or commercial matters;

(iv) a controlled representation is used pursuant to a
right created by registration of a design under
the Registered Designs Act 1949 or a trade mark
under the Trade Marks Act or is liable to be pre-
vented by virtue of such a right.

The Olympics Act also includes criminal offences
which derive from the Trade Marks Act and, so far
as the latter is concerned, are used as the basis of
counterfeiting actions. Specifically, the Olympics Act
provides that it is a criminal offence if, without the
owner’s consent, a person

(i) applies a controlled representation to goods or

their packaging;

(ii) sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale, or
hire or distributes goods which bear (or the
packaging of which bears) a controlled represen-
tation or has any such goods in his possession,
custody, or control in the course of a business;

(iii) applies a controlled representation to material
intended to be used for labelling or packaging
of goods, as business paper in relation to goods
or for advertising goods;

(iv) uses in the course of a business material bearing a
controlled representation for labelling or packa-
ging of goods, as a business paper in relation to
goods or for advertising goods, or has any such
material in his possession, custody, or control in
the course of a business;

(i) the use is not such as ordinarily to create an
association either with the Olympic Games or
movement or with a quality ordinarily associated
with the Olympic Games or movement;

(v) makes an article specifically designed or adapted
for making copies of a controlled representation
or having such an article in his possession, cus-
tody, or control
in the course of a business

knowing or having a reason to believe that it has
been, or is to be, used to produce goods or mate-
rial for labelling or packaging goods, as a business
paper in relation to goods or for advertising
goods.

It is, however, a defence for a person charged with
any of these offences to show that he believed on
reasonable grounds that the use was not an infringe-
ment of the Olympic association right.

The Olympics Act includes restrictions not only
just on use but also on who can register a controlled
representation as a trade mark or registered design.
A trade mark or design consisting of or containing a
controlled representation cannot be registered unless
the Patent Office is satisfied either that the applicant
for registration is the person appointed under the
Olympics Act as the owner of the Olympics associa-
tion right (currently the British Olympics Associa-
tion) or that the latter has given consent to the
applicant. Unregistered design right is also addressed
by the Olympics Act, which states that design right
does not subsist in a design that consists of or con-
tains a controlled representation.

Changes to the Olympic Act by the
Bill There are a number of changes of which the
major ones are as follows:

Joint ownership of
the Olympics association
right The Olympics association right may be owned
by more than one person. It may also be owned
jointly or concurrently and for different purposes;
so, for example, Paralympic associations can be joint
owners of Paralympic words and Olympic organiza-
tions can be joint owners of Olympic words.

Extension of Olympics association right and
protected words The Olympics association right is
extended to cover words so similar to the protected
words as to be likely to create an association in
the mind of the public with the Olympic Games or
the Olympic movement—the
relevant provision
in the Olympics Act refers to the Olympic symbol
and the Olympic motto only.

Protected words are also expanded to include var-
iations on ‘Paralympic’ such as ‘Paralympian’ as well
as the words ‘Olympic’,
‘Paralympic’,
and ‘Paralympics’.

‘Olympics’,

Restrictions on infringement The Olympics asso-
ciation right will not be infringed by the use of a con-
trolled representation

(i) as a necessary incident of publishing or broad-
casting a report of a sporting or other event
forming part of the Olympic Games;

(ii) where the use is as a necessary incident of pub-
lishing or broadcasting information about the
Olympic Games;

(iii) as an incidental inclusion in an artistic work,

sound recording, film, or broadcast;

(iv) where a controlled representation is included in
an advertisement for a publication or broadcast
of a kind mentioned above.

These defences are intended to allow news reporting
and journalistic use, both prospective and retrospec-
tive; so, for example, a current affairs programme
about or in preparation for the Olympics should
not infringe. The intention, it is said, is to protect
against gratuitous use in journalistic reporting which
does not accord with normal journalistic practice.

Use of a protected word in relation to parallel
imports will not infringe either, although conditions
apply:

(i) the goods must have been put on the market in

the EEA1 by the owner or with his consent;

(ii) the representation must have been used in rela-
tion to the goods when they were put on the
market;

(iii) the owner does not object to further dealings
in the goods (objections would typically arise
where the condition of the goods has been chan-
ged or impaired after they were initially put on
the market)

There is also no infringement where a protected
word is used in a context that is not likely to suggest
an association between a person, product, or service
and the Olympic Games or Olympic movement.

The concept of ‘association’ is defined to include
any kind of contractual or commercial relationship,
any kind of corporate or structural connection, or
the provision by a person of financial or other sup-
port for or in connection with the Olympic Games
or Olympic movement. ‘Association’ will not occur

however where a statement is made which accords
with honest practices in industrial or commercial
matters and does not make promotional or other
commercial use of a protected word by incorporating
it in a context to which the Olympic Games and the
Olympic movement are substantively irrelevant. An
example given in the Standing Committee debate
was a bus company offering travel services from
Hull to London for people to travel to watch the
Summer Olympics 2012; it being said that such com-
pany must be allowed to say that it is running services
from Hull to the Olympic Park—this would be in
accordance with honest commercial practice.

New Paralympics right A new Paralympics associa-
tion right is created: references to the Olympics asso-
ciation right will apply equally to the Paralympics
association right; so, for example, a reference to the
Olympics Games will be treated as a reference to the
Paralympic Games.

conviction in the magistrate’s court.

a

London Olympics association right A new ‘London
Olympics association right’ is created. This is an event
association right, designed to prevent ‘use of any
representation (of any kind) in a manner likely to
suggest to the public that there is an association
between the London Olympics and goods or services
or
services’. The
words ‘representation of any kind’ go further than
the Olympics association right which is restricted to
controlled representations: they prevent association
with the London Olympics through use of any words,
symbols, and matter other than those which are spe-
cifically protected under the Olympic Act. This is
likely to have far-reaching consequences.

provider

goods

or

of

The concept of

‘association’ between a person,
goods, or services and the London Olympics, as
with the Olympics association right,
includes any
kind of contractual or commercial relationship, any
kind of corporate or structural connection, and the
provision of financial or other support for, or in
connection with, the London Olympics. Again, there

will be no ‘association’ between a person, goods, or
a service and the London Olympics by virtue of a
statement which accords with honest practices in
industrial or commercial matters and does not
make promotional or other commercial use of a
representation relating to the London Olympics by
incorporating it in a context to which the London
Olympics is substantively irrelevant.

There is, however, a presumption of infringement,
in the absence of evidence to the contrary, where
any of the expressions ‘games’/‘two thousand and
twelve’/‘2012’/‘twenty twelve’ is used with one another
or with one of the following : ‘gold’/‘silver’/‘bronze’/
‘London’/‘medals’/‘sponsor’/‘summer’.

Again, this could have far-reaching consequences
and advertisers who fall foul of this provision, for
example by using the expression ‘London 2012’
without authorization, will
find that, contrary to
the normal rules of infringement, they bear the bur-
den of disproving infringement. This is said to be
consistent with the House of Lords judgment in
Sheldrake v DPP which states that reversal of the
burden of proof is consistent with Article 6 (right
to a fair trial) of
the European Convention on
Human Rights so long as the measure is justifiable
and proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.
In the Standing Committee debate however, it was
confirmed that the expressions ‘Visit London with
us in 2012’ and ‘Keep active and play outdoor games
this summer’ by, respectively, a hotel and a sports
organization for example would not amount
to
infringement. The expressions mentioned above can
be added to, restricted, or varied if thought ‘neces-
sary in order to prevent commercial exploitation of
the London Olympics’.

The London Olympics association right will not
be infringed, however, where any of the expressions or
combination of expressions listed above is a registered
trade mark and is used in relation to the specific goods
or services covered by the registration. Nor will it be
infringed where the defences to registered trade mark
infringement as set out in the Trade Marks Act
apply—namely where use of the expression in ques-
tion is

(i) use by a person of his own name or address;

(ii) use of an indication concerning the kind, quality,
intended purpose, or other characteristics of
goods or services;

In each case the use must be in accordance with hon-

in accordance with honest practices; so,

specific defence

There is a separate defence for use of company
names and the names of unincorporated businesses
which applies through application of the Olympic
Act. This provides that use of a representation as
part of a corporate name which was the name of the
company immediately before the day on which the
Bill comes into force will not infringe. The same
applies where the name of an unincorporated busi-
ness includes a representation and the business was
being carried on under that name immediately before
the day on which the Bill comes into force. The Bill is
expected to receive Royal Assent and come into force
early in 2006. Accordingly the example of ‘London
Games Limited’ incorporated in 2011 would not fall
within the specific company names defence given
the 2011 date of incorporation.

There are also publishing, broadcasting, and parallel
imports defences as for the Olympics association right.
Authorizations allowing use of a representation
by individuals or by a class of persons can be
granted by the London Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games (LOCOG). These are likely to
be issued primarily for the benefit of official sponsors

Practical significance
The Bill is very much in line with the Australian
legislation implemented for the Sydney Olympics
2000 and emulated by the Cricket World Cup 2003
in South Africa and the Athens Olympics 2004. The
first draft of the Bill, published on 15 July 2005,
encountered strong objections from the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising which said that the terms
of the Bill were ‘a step too far’. Amendments to the
Bill, all proposed by the Department of Culture,
Media and Sport, are welcome, in particular the defi-
nition of ‘association’ and the provisions allowing
incidental use of
the Olympic Symbol, Olympic
motto, protected and similar words. The concept of
‘honest practices in industrial and commercial mat-
ters’ is still relatively unclear, however, despite its
inclusion some 11 years ago in UK trade mark law.
Overall, it is still the case that in purely legal terms,
the Bill goes beyond the normal methods of redress
for breach of the relevant intellectual property rights,
namely actions for registered trade mark infringe-
ment and/or passing off. The former is relatively
straightforward and generally relies on showing that
the infringer is using an identical or similar sign for
the same or similar goods or services and that there
is a likelihood of confusion. The latter requires the
complainant
to show goodwill, confusion arising
from a misrepresentation by the defendant, and
damage typically as to source or an incorrect associa-
tion between the parties.

So far as the Bill relates to the London Olympics
association right, it creates a new and much wider-
ranging right to take action against

use of any representation (of any kind) in a manner
likely to suggest to the public that there is an associa-
tion between the London Olympics and goods or
services or a provider of goods or services.

limited to the use of registered or
This is not
unregistered trade marks, nor does

misrepresentation, confusion, or damage. The pre-
sumption of infringement where certain expressions
are used is also of concern notwithstanding its stated
compatibility with the European Convention on
Human Rights.

On a practical level, and judging from other major
events, the Bill would seem unlikely to prevent mar-

individual athletes or teams taking part in the Lon-
don Olympics 2012 as opposed to official sponsor-
are Nike’s
ship of
sponsorship of Michael
the Barcelona
Olympics 1992 and Adidas’
Ian
Thorpe at the Sydney Olympics 2000. Also at the
Sydney Olympics 2000, Cathy Freeman was spon-
sored not by the official sponsor Ansett Air but by
Qantas Airlines, who ran an extensive advertising
campaign featuring Freeman. In a similar vein, the
Bill may not preclude sponsored broadcasting of
an event. This may be as or more effective than
sponsoring the event
itself given that broadcasts,
certainly of the Olympics, will likely attract a world-
wide audience.

Perhaps not surprisingly, policing against ambush
marketing on the ground can be taken to extremes.
At the Rugby World Cup 2003 for example Vodafone
sponsored the Australian team but flags bearing the
Vodafone logo were confiscated outside the Telstra
stadium in Sydney.

Ambush marketing is a vexed topic. There are
schools of thought that regard it as ingenious and
contributing to increased awareness of events rather
than ‘free-riding on the coat-tails’ of official sponsors.
However you view it, ambush marketing is big busi-
ness and, while there has been little litigation in this
area to date, this may well change.

& Article 81 Defence struck
out in ‘legitimate reasons’
infringement action

Sportswear Company Spa and others v Ghattaura and
Stonestyle [2005] EWHC 2087

In an action for trade mark infringement under
s 12(2) Trade Marks Act 1994 to prevent
the
removal of label information and swing tags from
premium brand clothing an Article 81 defence
pleading hard-core
covenants
between the proprietor and his distributors was
struck out for lack of nexus.

anti-competitive

Legal context
At the heart of the application was the submission by
the Claimants that there was no nexus between anti-
competitive agreements under Article 81 EC Treaty
and infringement proceedings under section 12(2)
Trade Marks Act 1994.

Facts
The Claimants, owners of a premium clothing brand,
STONE ISLAND, brought an action for trade mark
infringement against a supplier and retailer under
section 12(2) Trade Marks Act 1994 (legitimate rea-
sons to prevent circulation of goods placed on the
market by trade mark proprietor or with his consent)
because they were selling STONE ISLAND clothing
which had had labels and swing tags removed or
defaced. There was no dispute that the goods had
been placed on the market in the EEA with the con-
sent of the Claimants.

Analysis
The Claimants claimed that the sale of such clothing
damaged the reputation of the mark because the pub-
lic had the right to expect their goods to be in mint
condition. The Defendants claimed that they had car-
ried out the acts because the labels and swing tags had
garment codes which permitted the Claimants to
identify the source of clothing. They said that the
Claimants would use such information to stop such
supplies and thus interfere in the grey market for
STONE ISLAND goods. The Claimants accepted
that such arguments were relevant when the Court
had to consider whether there were ‘legitimate rea-
sons’ under section 12(2).

However, the Defendants also raised an Article 81
defence to the trade mark infringement action.
They said that the distribution agreements between
the trade mark proprietor and its UK distributor
were anti-competitive containing price-fixing and
anti-parallel import provisions and were thus con-
trary to Article 81. As an alternative defence, they
also pleaded that the action had been brought as
an ‘object, means or consequences’ of
this anti-
competitive agreement and was thus also contrary
to Article 81.

The Claimants applied to strike out the defence
to the
