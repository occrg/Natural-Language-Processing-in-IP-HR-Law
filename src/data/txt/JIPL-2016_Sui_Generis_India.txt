Sui generis is the answer: positive protection
of traditional knowledge in India
Deekshitha Ganesan*

The protection of traditional knowledge (TK) as an
intellectual property right in India is still in its infancy.
The debate on the importance of protecting TK
increased following a number of patents granted in
the United States and the European Union on TK
used for centuries by Indian indigenous communities.
India was one of the ﬁrst countries that attempted
to develop a system to protect its TK, establishing the
Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). However,
this early effort was not followed by signiﬁcant develop-
ments. Since the TKDL is merely a database, questions
remain as to the real extent of the protection of TK in
India and its effectiveness in ensuring that the beneﬁts of
such knowledge reach the indigenous communities.

This article looks at the history and development of
the TKDL and its role as a defensive protection, with ref-
erence to the systems adopted by other countries to
protect TK. The key questions analysed in this article
concern: (i) whether the TKDL is a comprehensive data-
base of TK, (ii) how far the TKDL constitutes an indica-
tor of prior art references and (iii) what method of TK
protection should be adopted in India. Given the limited
scope of this article, alternative means of protection will
not be examined.

The ﬁrst section examines the history and reasons
behind the creation of the TKDL. In addition, it dis-
cusses the agreements between the Council for Scien-
tiﬁc and Industrial Research (CSIR), which developed
the database, and foreign patent ofﬁces. The second
section focuses on the status of TK as prior art, in
reference to the patentability requirements of novelty
and non-obviousness. Further,
it examines the im-
portance of the TKDL as an indicator of prior art
references, as well as its success in supporting chal-
lenges to patent applications ﬁled after its creation.
The third section looks at the limitations of the TKDL
and discusses whether it is a comprehensive database.
Finally, drawing from the experiences of other coun-
tries, it analyses how far the scope and functions of the
TKDL can be increased to develop a sui generis system
of protection for TK.

† The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library
(TKDL), developed by India, was one of the earliest
initiatives in protecting traditional knowledge in
the world. As a country rich in traditional knowl-
edge largely unknown to the rest of the world,
India set up the TKDL to ensure that this knowl-
edge was not misappropriated by third parties
using more traditional means of IP protection such
as patents. However, the TKDL remains a defensive
protection of traditional knowledge that does not
fully ensure that the beneﬁts of the information
reach its original holders as far as possible. This
article looks at the origins of the TKDL, its scope
and role, and, ﬁnally, at the need for a sui generis
protection for traditional knowledge in India.

† Although discussions on the development of a
universal
framework for protecting traditional
knowledge are ongoing at the World Intellectual
Property Organization, the process of consensus
building has been slow. Therefore, legislation and
protection mechanisms in each individual country
will continue to determine how such knowledge
can be used by third parties.

† This article suggests that India should adopt a frame-
work for the protection of traditional knowledge
similar to that of Peru, in order to provide legal cer-
tainty both for the communities that hold such trad-
itional knowledge and for the third parties that seek
to make use of it. Keeping in mind the many beneﬁts
that traditional knowledge has to offer, the objective
of such framework would be to make the knowledge
available for beneﬁcial exploitation, while ensuring
that the local communities receive their due.

History of the traditional knowledge
digital library
The international discussion on the protection of TK1 is
rooted in the problem of bio-piracy, where TK is misap-
propriated for commercial gain and patents are obtained
without the consent of the holders of such TK and with-
out any compensation in return. In these cases, patent
protection is granted to whoever is the ‘ﬁrst-to-ﬁle’ rather
than the ‘ﬁrst-to-invent’.2 In addition to issues of unfair
advantage and lack of consent, granting such patents in-
correctly is of commercial disadvantage to the holder as it
would make it unlawful to export such products to coun-
tries where the patent has been granted.

Attempts to patent and misappropriate TK ﬁrst came
to light in India in the patent application for turmeric in
the United States.3 The application, ﬁled by two non-
resident Indians, concerned certain wound healing prop-
erties of turmeric. In response, the CSIR ﬁled objections
contending that the twin conditions of novelty and non-
obviousness were not satisﬁed. References from ancient
Indian scriptures and an article from an Indian medical
journal were submitted as evidence of the use of tur-
meric for the claimed purposes for many centuries.4
Consequently, the US patent ofﬁce revoked the patent
that had been granted in 1997.

Another example was an application ﬁled in the Euro-
pean Patent Ofﬁce (EPO) by AgriDyne, a company based
in the United States, to patent an oil extract derived
from the Neem tree. The claim was that the extract could
be used as a fungicide and insecticide, which are com-
monly known and accepted uses of Neem tree extracts in
India. As the EPO does not make a distinction between
prior art that is regional or foreign, published or un-
published, the patent granted in 1994 was subsequently
revoked. However, the same patent remained valid in

1 The deﬁnition of TK has been the subject of much debate and countries
have objected to calling such knowledge ‘traditional’ due to its dynamic
nature and adaptability. However, the WIPO deﬁnition of TK as ‘[t]he
content or substance of knowledge resulting from intellectual activity in a
traditional context, and includes the know-how, skill, innovations,
practices and learning that form part of traditional knowledge system, and
knowledge embodying traditional lifestyles of indigenous and local
communities, or contained in codiﬁed knowledge system passed between
generations’ is the prevalent understanding.

the United States as foreign oral prior art is evaluated
differently.5

In addition to these two instances, India has also suc-
cessfully defended its TK in a patent application for bas-
mati rice. The huge amount of money spent in ensuring
that these patent applications did not succeed made it
unviable to continue challenging them on an individual
basis.6 These experiences before international patent
ofﬁces prompted the Government of India, through the
Ministry of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy
(AYUSH) and the CSIR, to develop a database—the
TKDL—as a defensive protection mechanism, in 2001.7
The TKDL does not ensure that TK holders obtain
any speciﬁc rights over their knowledge. However, it
enables the protection of such TK from misappropri-
ation by breaking the barriers of language and access.8
The TKDL aims at digitizing existing publicly available
literature on TK, speciﬁcally Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani
and Yoga, by translating it into English, French, Spanish,
Japanese and German, creating a database of prior art
references that does not constitute prior art by itself.9
It acts as bridge between the original Sanskrit and ver-
nacular texts and the various international patent off-
ices which make use of this information to identify
prior art.

Following the decision of the Government of India to
permit the sharing of the database, access was granted
free of cost to the Indian patent ofﬁce, as well as to the
EPO (2009) and the German (2009), United States (2010),
Japanese (2011), Canadian (2010) and Australian (2011)
patent ofﬁces.10 In order to prevent bio-piracy, the access
agreements stipulate that the contents of the TKDL cannot
be revealed to any third party, including after termination
of the agreement, unless required for patent search and
examination and to provide citations of prior art to appli-
cants.11 The patent ofﬁces are also required to provide, on

a quarterly basis, information on how the TKDL was uti-
lized for prior art searches.12

The agreements are not very detailed and merely
contain a minimum set of provisions; particularly disap-
pointing is the lack of a strong dispute resolution clause.
The standard clause on ‘[s]ettlement of disputes’ only
provides that disputes are to be settled amicably: this
appears to be insufﬁcient given the importance of the in-
formation that the TKDL has collected and distributed
free of cost.

Traditional knowledge as prior art
Much of the above discussion on the development of the
TKDL is premised on the fact that such TK does in fact
constitute prior art.13 Therefore, it raises the question of
whether, despite its distinguishing features, TK can be
universally considered to be prior art.

Prior art is a crucial component of the process of
evaluating whether a patent can be granted, as the inven-
tion needs to fulﬁl the requirements of novelty and non-
obviousness.14 The condition of novelty is satisﬁed if the
invention does not form part of the prior art and has not
been disclosed to the public; this determination involves
a comparison of the invention and the prior art.15 Non-
obviousness, on the other hand, requires the patentee to
establish the invention is not obvious to a person skilled
in the art.16 Since prior art plays an important role in the
process of determining the validity of patents, its precise
deﬁnition and extent is a crucial part of the inquiry.17

The deﬁnition of prior art depends on each jurisdic-
tion. For instance, the European Patent Convention and
the Japan Patent Act both deﬁne prior art as including
any disclosures made before the priority date of the
invention,
including those made orally, without any

16 Ibid, 209. In the United States (35 USC s 103), the European Union and in
the United Kingdom (Patents Act, 1977), the condition of non-obviousness
requires a determination of the scope and content of the prior art, the
differences between the prior art and the inventive concept of the claim and

geographical boundaries. However, the United States
Patent Act considers oral disclosures as prior art only if
made within the country,18 while written disclosures are
included regardless of boundaries.19

The need to evaluate novelty and non-obviousness
has spurred the debate on how TK can be assessed as
prior art, especially where it is part of oral traditions. In
order to defeat a patent application, it is necessary to
prove that the knowledge, as prior art, was already in the
public domain, that the invention has a conceptual con-
nection with such knowledge, and that this knowledge
was ﬁrst realized by the indigenous community.20 The
examiner also has to determine whether the disclosed
TK would have made the invention obvious to any
person skilled in the art. This could pose difﬁculties if an
invention draws from publicly accessible TK but the
skills to interpret such knowledge are only known within
the community.21 Countries have given differing opi-
nions to the WIPO Inter-Governmental Committee on
Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional
Knowledge and Folklore (IGC) on how to address this
situation, depending on the geographical origins of the
TK. However, it is submitted that the opinions expressed
by the EPO and Trinidad and Tobago provide the correct
answer. According to the latter, ‘[o]nce the knowledge
becomes explicit it can be assumed that any person with
average skill in the art with access to the explicit knowl-
edge can utilize the art’22; therefore, the invention may
fail the test of non-obviousness. Further, even if this
knowledge is public only to a limited extent, that is,
within the community itself, ‘the knowledge is still con-
sidered public domain’23 and the invention may fail the
test of novelty.

While most countries have not directly clariﬁed whe-
ther TK would constitute prior art, India has provided a

whether these differences would have been obvious to a person skilled in
the art. In the United States, there exist other secondary considerations that
aid in the process of determining non-obviousness.

17 A single disclosure is generally considered sufﬁcient to destroy the novelty
of an invention. Similarly, if the invented product is used in a public place
once, even if no one observed the details of its working, the invention is no
longer considered novel.

18 Therefore, TK handed down through generations in foreign countries, but

which has not been documented, can be patented and used in the United
States.

positive answer through amendments to ss 25 and 64 of
the Indian Patent Act 1970.24 The latter provides an add-
itional ground for revocation of a patent on the basis
that the invention is already covered and known as part
of TK. Despite these individual measures, the manner of
protection of TK at the international level remains un-
certain as the WIPO IGC works on building consensus
on appropriate solutions. The Inter-Governmental Com-
mittee noted the distinctiveness of TK and identiﬁed
certain key considerations to be kept in mind when pub-
lishing TK. Due to its largely oral and undocumented
nature, taking prior consent from the holders of the TK
before releasing the information into the public domain
is imperative, as this could affect their rights to seek pro-
tection of such knowledge.25

As for other types of prior art, the date when the in-
formation was publicly made available is crucial in deter-
mining whether the TK can be considered as prior art. If
a document already existed, the date of publication will
be considered as the relevant date.26 The publication,
however, is also expected to be detailed and comprehen-
sive.27 While this aspect can prove to be a problem with
TK that is transmitted from generation to generation,
across communities, efforts like the TKDL strive to make
sure that TK is consolidated and made available. The
most signiﬁcant issue, however, is whether the TK was
available to the public or not. Generally, a single disclos-
ure is sufﬁcient for information to be considered as
public. However, as the speciﬁc knowledge of most TK is
conﬁned to communities, it is advantageous, from a prac-
tical perspective when challenging a patent, if the TK was
nevertheless easily accessible by people doing research in
the ﬁeld, and particularly by patent examiners.28

Despite these obvious challenges, there is consensus
that TK cannot be excluded from the scope of ‘prior art’.
The issues identiﬁed above are being addressed in the

on-going and important process of documentation of
TK around the world. Admittedly, at no point in time is
it possible to compile all TK in a single database. Never-
theless, when access to databases is shared, even if ac-
companied by limitations,
it reduces the chance of
incorrect patents being granted, as the patent applica-
tions can be tested against the TK prior art and the
requirements of novelty and non-obviousness.

An evaluation of whether TK constitutes prior art is
necessarily a fact-based analysis. Given the nature of TK,
a broader interpretation would be appropriate especially
in cases where the TK prior art exists only as ‘prior use’.
Interpreting the ‘availability’ of information and the
extent of publication strictly would prove counterpro-
ductive, as it could have the effect of excluding certain
kinds of TK.

The TKDL initiative was aimed at addressing some of
these challenges. It is a cost-effective mechanism that
eliminates the otherwise huge expenditure that would
have been incurred before patent ofﬁces around the
world in challenging misappropriation of TK through
patenting. Further, it has not increased the risk of bio-
piracy, as it is a closed access database.29 As an indicator
of prior art references, the TKDL has, to some extent,
achieved the twin objectives of preventing misappropri-
ation, by making TK prior art publicly available, and
promoting access to information on existing, public
knowledge. The TKDL team has ﬁled third-party obser-
vations at the EPO in over 200 cases that have led to the
patent being refused or the application being withdrawn.
For example, challenges30 have been brought, inter alia,
against patent applications on the role of ginger, onion
and cumin as slimming agents, the use of the watery
extract of melons as an anti-vitiligo cream, the beneﬁts
of pomegranate in treating heart diseases, skin ailments
and the use of Ashwagandha to treat stress.31

24 Avilia, above, n 9, 46. In Merell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc and another v HN

Norton & Co Ltd [1996] RPC 76, Lord Hoffmann uses the example of an
Amazonian Indian who uses the bark of a special tree to treat malaria,
stating that he will be considered to be using quinine even if he chooses to
believe that it is the ‘magic spirit of the bark’, similarly to a scientist who
might also use such powdered bark to treat malaria if he did not have
quinine sulphate. Lord Hoffmann notes that the prior art does not
necessarily have to be in the form of a chemical equation. Therefore, it can
be inferred that the tree bark that helps treat malaria would constitute prior
art. This is similar to the case where neem extracts were sought to be
patented for their ability to act as a fungicide, despite Indians having used
the neem tree for the same purpose for centuries.

There is, however, some scepticism on the truthful-
ness of the claims made by the TKDL team regarding its
success in challenging patent applications. It would
appear that the team has, in the past, overstated the role
of the TKDL in inﬂuencing the decision of EPO exami-
ners.32 While the TKDL team has frequently submitted
third party observations, the extent to which these obser-
vations have impacted the EPO examiners is in question.
This circumstance, together with the limited informa-
tion available on TK in the public domain and the closed
access nature of the database, casts doubts on the true
success of the TKDL initiative.

Need for suigenerisprotection in India
As a defensive mechanism, the TKDL has been successful
in its limited aim of consolidating available TK prior art
relating to traditional Indian medicinal practices.33 As any
database system, the TKLD faces limitations, such as trans-
lation problems that could result in ineffective searches.34
More signiﬁcantly, the TKDL has left unrecorded a variety
of sources, including oral TK, which ought to be protected
similarly to other forms of TK. Besides the issues related to
collection and codiﬁcation of oral TK, however, there are
no other relevant obstacles to its protection. In this part, a
different approach, based on a sui generis model of protec-
tion, is proposed to remedy the situation.

The exclusion of oral TK from the TKDL, whether de-
liberate or otherwise, is at the heart of a new positive
protection framework that India needs to develop to
protect its TK. The documented TK is information that
was already publicly available. Oral TKs and knowledge
speciﬁc to certain communities are better protected by
access and beneﬁt sharing mechanisms.

This combination of defensive and positive protection
has been adopted successfully by some countries,35 and
it is submitted that India should implement a similar

method of protection. Although there is a range of posi-
tive methods of protection of TK (such as patents, trade
secret protection, trade mark, geographical indication
etc), the predominant approach,36 also advanced in the
WIPO negotiations on TK, has been to develop a sui
generis method of protection.

For

instance, prospecting agreements have been
entered into by Costa Rica with research companies for
access to biological material and TK. One of these con-
tracts was signed between a government entity and the
US company Merck for over 10 000 samples of plant and
animal varieties to be obtained with the help of the
population. In return, the company agreed to pay $1
million, provide $130 million worth of equipment, fa-
cilitate technology transfer and pay royalties for any
drug that would be discovered as a result to be used in
conservation efforts.37 The obvious downside to this
agreement is that the Costa Rican government would
have no recourse against a third party who obtained in-
formation from Merck and used it. Further, the govern-
ment agreed to deal with TK that is not owned by the
State and there was no involvement of the indigenous
population in the negotiation process. However, this
model has been applied in other countries, like South
Africa, with an increased focus on the rights and needs
of the native population.38 Brazil’s TK legislation identi-
ﬁes and guarantees the rights of TK holders; further, it
contains a chapter dedicated to beneﬁt sharing, which
recognizes the right of TK holders to assign their rights
and enter into licensing agreements.39

Peru’s regime is also governed by legislation (Law
27811 of 24 July 2002) primarily focused on the rights of
indigenous communities. It establishes that TK cannot
be individually owned and that the indigenous people
must exercise their rights collectively through a repre-
sentative organization for their well-being and to set
their own priorities.40 The communities can also grant

objections claimed by the CSIR have been called into question.

of the nascent stage of development of the legal framework on the
protection of TK and of the lack of consensus on the appropriate method
to construe such framework at an international level.

(prior and informed) consent to licensing agreements,
provided there is equitable beneﬁt sharing.41 Further,
two separate royalty payments are to be negotiated: one
as a percentage of the market sales of the product devel-
oped, to be set aside in a fund, and another, of no less
than 5 per cent of the gross value of the market sales, as
payment for sustainable development.42 Contributions
to the fund go towards the beneﬁt of all indigenous com-
munities, for ﬁnancing development projects.43

Peru has also divided its TK into three categories.
First, where the TK has become known outside the indi-
genous community by mass communication and media
and can be easily accessed, it is deemed to be in the
public domain. Secondly, if the TK has passed into the
public domain in the previous 20 years, it is considered
to be in the public domain, but its use will require
payment of royalties. These two categories of TK are
entered in the Public Register of Collective Knowledge of
Indigenous People. The third category includes undis-
closed TK that is entered into the Conﬁdential National
Register of Indigenous People, on request.44 Infringe-
ment actions can be brought by the communities if any
of their rights under the statute are violated. Peru’s model
performs both the defensive and positive functions. The
information concerning TK contained in the registries is
often sent to patent ofﬁces around the world to determine
whether the conditions of novelty and non-obviousness
are satisﬁed against prior art. Further, all patent applica-
tions that make use of TK are required to submit copies
of the licensing agreement or equivalent contract; if the
requirement is not fulﬁlled,
the application may be
rejected. The only exception concerns TK that is already
in the public domain.45

The Peruvian model integrates the many facets of TK
protection into a single statute. It acknowledges the
group nature of TK rights and ensures that crucial
knowledge remains available for technological innov-
ation, with the consent of the indigenous communi-
ties.46 It appears that the TKDL and India’s existing TK
protection framework began with similar intentions. It
would be beneﬁcial for India to mirror the Peruvian

model to strengthen the existing protection and ﬁll the
gap created by oral and undocumented TKs.

Introducing conﬁdential registers will help in docu-
menting TK that indigenous communities do not wish
to make available to the general public immediately,
allowing them to share it on a contract basis with prior,
informed consent. Supplementing the current regime of
protection with a legislation tailored for TK47 that ex-
pressly recognizes the rights of indigenous communities
to license TK through their representative organizations,
India will be able to achieve a ﬁne balance between posi-
tive and defensive protection.

In addition, this model will also aid in the protection of
oral TK. Communities can choose to register oral TK in
either the conﬁdential or public register. If registered in the
former, it will be inaccessible to third parties. However, the
communities can eventually choose to enter into licensing
contracts and beneﬁt sharing agreements regarding such
TK. This solution, in combination with a condition similar
to proviso (ii)(d) to s 10 of the Indian Patent Act 1970,
which requires the geographical origin of biological mater-
ial used in an invention to be speciﬁed, could help prevent
bio-piracy by making it mandatory for companies to
reveal the source of the TK in order to receive protection.

However, it is not that the sui generis model is a
concept that is alien to India. It has been used in the past
in the protection of the Jeevani (Aarogyapaccha) plant.48
Researchers working in the Agastyamalai Mountains
noticed that the Kani tribes consumed a wild berry that
had immunity enhancing, restorative qualities, later con-
ﬁrmed by laboratory tests. The technology was trans-
ferred to a pharmacy in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and
the medicine was marketed successfully. Fifty per cent of
the licensing fee and royalties was set aside for the devel-
opment of the Kani tribe through a trust. However, there
were allegations of mismanagement of funds and the
beneﬁts did not fully reach the tribe when the Govern-
ment of Kerala got involved.49 This is an example of a sui
generis system (though developed privately in this case)
that can support the TKDL in the prevention of mis-
appropriation by giving indigenous communities their

purpose of granting rights over the TK, but rather aim at defensive
protection to aid in prior art searches and to maintain the collective
knowledge of communities.

46 Unlike the Panama model, where the focus is more on commercialization
but which is limited territorially to Panama alone, or the Brazilian model,
which also grants individual rights over TK. See Romero, above, n 41.

47 The Bio-Diversity Act, 2002 and Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’

Rights Act, 2001 have a more narrow scope. The latter, for instance, is
applicable only to farmers. In addition, the former statute also requires the
National Biodiversity Authority’s consent, as opposed to the involvement
of the indigenous communities in the negotiation process.

due. It is imperative to proceed towards a codiﬁcation of
these rights and of the corresponding duties and respon-
sibilities of those making use of such knowledge.

Peru points the way
The TKDL, created as a response to indiscriminate
patenting of Indian TK, is today one of the largest data-
bases of its kind. However, it is nowhere near to provid-
ing a consolidation of the entire oral and undocumented
TK available in India. This appears to be the result of a
conscious structural decision, as such wide consolidation
was never the intention of the TKDL. The initiative
focused on translating documents that were already pub-
licly available on traditional Indian medicine, preventing
the risk that these medicines and treatments could
become inaccessible to the population, by virtue of in-
correct grant of patents.

This is also the reason why patenting, as a means of
protection of TK in India, is not desirable, as it would
put out of reach the very knowledge that a protection

framework for TK seeks to make available. Other forms
of intellectual property rights also appear to be inad-
equate in protecting TK. For instance, the protection
accorded to trade secrets would not protect TK that is
already in the public domain,50 while geographical indi-
cations and trade marks would not protect the content
of the knowledge.

In light of this, it is imperative for India to develop a
sui generis model of protection along the lines of the
Peruvian statute, in order to ensure that while making
known and unknown TK available to the public, the in-
digenous communities also receive their due. The deci-
sion to enter into licensing agreements should be solely
within the domain of the communities, with the neces-
sary assistance of the State. This approach, accompanied
by the creation of different registers for TK, differen-
tiated on the basis of the extent of the conﬁdentiality of
the knowledge, will serve a dual purpose, aiding prior
art searches, to prevent misappropriation through paten-
ting, and ensuring that this dynamic knowledge is con-
solidated and does not disappear over time.

Knowledge’ (2011) 36 Yale J Int’l L 371.
