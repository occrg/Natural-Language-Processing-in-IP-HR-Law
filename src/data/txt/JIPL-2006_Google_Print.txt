Legal reflections on the Google Print Library
Project
Joseph Savirimuthu*

1. The challenge of leveraging
the internet
The controversy involving Google and the Authors
Guild can be regarded as an example of the way the
digital environment demands a re-examination of
business strategies that sustain existing product and
revenue streams. This controversy reÔ¨Çects concern
that the markets for mass consumption of goods,
and the channels for their distribution and produc-
tion, cannot be sustained without supportive intellec-
tual property rights infrastructures and mechanisms.1
Google could have anticipated many of the sub-
stantive issues relating to copyright and opted instead
for the expedient mechanism of a contractual licence
from the Authors Guild. While copyright rules and
norms permit parties to order their activities and
relations, lawyers must nevertheless be alert to the
malleability of copyright rules and norms and the
likely implications of technological and legislative
developments. The uncertain boundaries of the jurid-
ical framework of ‚Äòfair use‚Äô under section 107 of the
Copyright Act 1976, the pronouncements in Kelly v
Arriba Soft,2 and the action initiated by Perfect 10,
challenging search engine operators‚Äô reliance on the
fair use defence in respect of their use of thumbnail
images of copyright works, suggest on close examina-
tion that the simple rules and norms conceal a num-
ber of complex problems.

One major issue that cross-cuts many of

the
debates on how best to address the copyright and
business issues is whether innovative strategies can
be found for increasing consumers, and public access
to digital content.3 It is beyond the scope of this arti-
cle to analyse juridical attempts to deal with the

Google that it was proposing to create an all-
embracing online library was met by a range
of responses ranging from enthusiastic endorse-

 Much of the response to the Google Library

cerning the extent to which copyright law does

issues relating to property entitlements. It concludes
that, notwithstanding the problems of designing
appropriate frameworks
to sustain property and
non-proprietary systems in the digital environment,
the opportunities created by the open standards
framework in this environment may provide some
clues on how best to leverage the exponential poten-
tial of the resources provided by the internet.

2. The Google dispute
Copyright law has long been plagued by arguments
surrounding the scope of the proprietary entitlements
of owners against the background of the public inter-
est in the dissemination of information. To a layper-
son observing disputes over the use of photographs
from tabloid newspapers, logos in a newspaper, dis-
tributing cuttings from a newspaper to staff in a com-
pany, or downloading music Ô¨Åles, the reÔ¨Ånements of
copyright law may seem strangely at odds with rea-
sonable expectations of members of the public that
they enjoy free access to material. A central feature
of contemporary debates is the assertion that copy-
right law impedes the proper dissemination of ideas
and curtails freedom of expression.5 This is the view
of some who take issue with the decision by the
Authors Guild to Ô¨Åle a class action suit for copyright
infringement against the commercial search engine
provider Google.6 The suit was Ô¨Åled a year after Goo-
gle announced its plans to digitize the existing collec-
tion of books held in the libraries of four universities
and the New York Public Library.7

Google launched two projects. Under the Google
Book Search Program for Authors and Publishers
(GBSP), copyright owners can submit books for con-
version into digital texts.8 The GBSP aims to provide
copyright owners of books with an opportunity to
publicize information about books through Google‚Äôs
homepage.9 This is a voluntary project. Only owners
of copyright in the books can submit book titles
and content.10

The Google Book Library Project (Google Print)
goes further. This is a plan to digitize all the books

held by the selected libraries. Scanning would cover
books both in print and out of print. If the project
had been limited to scanning books out of copyright,
that would have been the end of the matter. However,
when information surfaced that Google was planning
to expand its search database of literary works by
scanning books in copyright, questions regarding

infringement of the literary copyright of authors were
raised. To stem these concerns Google issued a press
release indicating that publishers who opposed the
inclusion of their copyright works in Google Print
can opt out of the scheme. Google also attempted to
assure the publishers that the copyright in literary
works would be respected. For example, if there is
content to match the search terms relating to books
currently in copyright, only extracts will be made
available. In addition to the information about the
book being displayed, the search engine will also dis-
play links to sources where the book can be obtained.
The Authors Guild, a society of published writers
in the United States, represents more than 8000 mem-
bers. In an action brought against Google it maintains
that the scanning of the texts of copyright works in
print and those out of print held by the University
of Michigan constituted an infringement of literary
copyright.11 The guild also argued that the assump-
tion by Google of their exclusive rights threatened
to undermine the market for licensing their works.

their

creative
protection and compensation for
works.12 The 1976 Copyright Act, as amended
by Congress, gives copyright owners exclusive rights
to reproduce works
in copies or phonorecords
and to prepare derivative works based upon the copy-
right work. Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act pro-
vides that copyright protection subsists in original
works of authorship, Ô¨Åxed in any tangible medium
of expression, now known or later developed, from
which they can be perceived, reproduced, or other-
wise communicated, either directly or with the aid
of a machine or otherwise. ‚ÄòLiterary works‚Äô include
books, collections,
translations, and compilations.
Section 102(b) states that work not Ô¨Åxed in a tangible
form of expression, listings of ingredients, and con-
tents lists, titles, names, and short phrases are not
protected. Section 106 provides copyright owners of
literary works with a range of proprietary entitle-
ments that
includes the rights to reproduce the
copyright, to distribute copies of the work to the
public, and to display the copyright work publicly.
Third parties
these
rights, unless speciÔ¨Åc exemptions apply, must obtain
prior authorization from the owner of the copy-
right.13 Reading sections 101 and 106 together,
it appears that
the scanning of copyright works
constitutes an infringement of the author‚Äôs literary
copyright. It follows from this that a third party
copyright
must obtain permissions where
work has been exploited in various media.
In
New York Times v Tasini,
the Supreme Court
held the defendants liable for infringing the literary
journalists,
copyright

though they obtained consent
from the print
publishers.14

Assuming that there is a prima facie case of copy-
right infringement, a defendant in the position of
Google can avoid liability under the 1976 Act if it
can avail itself of speciÔ¨Åc exemptions or defences.
Of particular relevance to Google is the fair use

defence under section 107. When determining fair
use the court will take into account

(i) the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or
is for non-profit educational purposes;

(ii) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(iii) the amount and substantiality of the portion used
in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;
and

(iv) the effect of the use upon the potential market

for or value of the copyrighted work.

Two observations may be offered. First, a commercial
enterprise such as Google is not barred from relying
on this defence. Ground (1) expressly provides that
use of the copyright work is not limited to non-proÔ¨Åt
or philanthropic activities. Second, ground (3) is
unlikely to assist Google since the complaint made
by the Authors Guild is that the entire copyright
work has been scanned and stored in the search
engine provider‚Äôs database.

Disagreements as to the applicability of grounds
(1), (2), and (4) raise a range of substantive and
policy issues. Is the wider public beneÔ¨Åt to be derived
from increased access relevant to the issue of fair
use?15 Should Google be permitted to succeed, par-
ticularly as a number of copyright works scanned
into its database are either out of print or not gener-
ally well known to the public?16 Is it practical to
require Google to obtain consent from every individ-
ual author whose works are held in the library
collections?17 Is the scanning of the digital work a
‚Äòtechnical‚Äô copyright infringement, bearing in mind
that users will see only selected extracts? What
are the consequences for technological
innovation
and the beneÔ¨Åts offered by search engines in dissemi-
nating information if the fair use defence is denied?
Should copyright
rules designed for print be
mechanically applied to scanning collections
in
libraries to be stored in search engine servers?18

12 The US Constitution Art I, s 8, cl 8 envisages that copyright be protected so
as to ‚Äòpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries‚Äô.

The extensive jurisprudence on fair use is partly
attributable to the fact that the furtherance of the
public good has long been seen as an important
feature of the defence.19 As the Judiciary Committee
to the House of Representatives in its Report to Con-
gress noted, there is a trade-off between providing
producers with a set of exclusive proprietary entitle-
ments and ensuring that information and ideas are
freely accessible to the public.20

the
jurisprudence on fair use, the following characteristics

unpublished collection of letters and writings.21 Next,
the balance may tilt in favour of the copyright owner
if the defendant‚Äôs use of the work damages the for-
mer‚Äôs principal market operation.22

to have recognized that

Recently, in MGM v Grokster, the Supreme Court
appears
the disbeneÔ¨Åts
accompanying the restrictions imposed by copyright
maintain the stability and integrity of the operation
of the market.23 Jonathan Band avoids the issue of
market stability by arguing that Google‚Äôs activities
will lead to an increase in the demand for books.24
There is, however, a fundamental objection to this
argument and it is to do with the fact that the

complainants in the lawsuit are not the publishers
but the authors.

Finally, defendants have successfully relied on the
fair use defence by arguing that the use of the work
is transformative and non-consumptive. In Field v
Google Inc, a court held that the use of search engine
functionality to cache web pages was a fair use for the
purposes of the Copyright Act and could also be
regarded as an intermediate and temporary storage
of material under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act.25 In reaching this conclusion the court drew
attention to the transformative character of
the
work undertaken by Google, namely the provision
of users with material information that would not
have been readily apparent from the complainant‚Äôs
web page.26 The mere posting of copyright informa-
tion on a website is, however, unlikely to be seen as
a form of transformative use.27 In Kelly v Arriba Soft
the display of thumbnail images reduced from copies
made of full-size images of the plaintiff‚Äôs website was
held to be a transformative use.28

Returning to the Google Print dispute, Google‚Äôs
regarded as non-
actions
consumptive of the plaintiff‚Äôs literary works.29 The
act of reproduction undertaken by Google cannot
by any stretch of the imagination be seen as a soft-
ware equivalent of a web crawler. In MAI Systems
Corp v Peak Computer the act of starting up a com-
puter, which leads to the operating system being cop-
ied into the RAM, was held to be an unauthorized
reproduction of copyrighted software.30 By analogy,
even though the use of the copyright material under
the search display may not be substantial, the act of
uploading and the previous digital scanning would
constitute a usurpation of
the copyright owner‚Äôs
exclusive right of reproduction.31

Joseph Savirimuthu ¬∑ The Google print library project

The major stumbling block to Google‚Äôs reliance on
the principle of transformative use is the recent ruling
of Judge Matz in Perfect 10 v Google Inc, which
appears to contextualize the scope of the transforma-
tive use defence within prevailing market norms and
practices. Perfect 10 own and run an adult entertain-
ment business with an online presence. There are
copyright pictures of nude models on this site. Perfect
10‚Äôs business model generates revenue streams from
the sale of magazines and the provision of sub-
scription services. Unlike the complainants in Kelly,
Perfect 10 licenses reduced-sized images of nude
models for downloading by mobile phone users.
Google provide an image search functionality which
displays miniaturized versions of pictures on their
website as well as providing links to Perfect 10‚Äôs web-
site. Perfect 10 argued that the creation and display of
thumbnail images of the copyright pictures consti-
tuted an infringement of
its rights under section
106. The court rejected Google‚Äôs reliance on section
107 with regard to the creation and display of the
thumbnail images.

Although the court was hearing only a motion for a
preliminary injunction, the line of reasoning pursued
by Judge Matz is instructive. He held that the use of
Google‚Äôs inline linking and frames to enable users to
view images from Perfect 10‚Äôs website did not consti-
tute an infringement of Perfect 10‚Äôs copyright in its
full-size photographs. The basis for this conclusion
was that the use of the thumbnails was prompted by
the need to make the information easy to locate and
manage, and to generally increase its accessibility,
particularly to advertisers. Thus, the reduced-sized
images were transformative in the sense that their
creation and display was designed to display visual
search results quickly and efÔ¨Åciently. In this respect
the Perfect 10 case adopts a similar approach to that
taken in Kelly v Arriba Soft. Any gains for Google
must, however, be seen as being minimal since the
court then held that the display of the thumbnail
images of the nude pictures on Google‚Äôs website
did constitute infringement of the copyright in the
reduced-sized images as it superseded the plaintiff‚Äôs

activities of supplying these images to mobile phone
companies.

We can summarize the arguments canvassed so far.
Arguments about the beneÔ¨Åts of increasing access
and knowledge cannot be viewed in isolation. Where
appropriate, the beneÔ¨Åts of increased access must be
balanced against considerations relating to market
norms and practices and the importance of enforcing
property rights.32 There is a strong commercial bias
in the way the defence of fair use is interpreted. In
particular, a defence of fair use is unlikely to succeed
if there is a workable and efÔ¨Åcient instrument such as
contractual and licensing agreements. A defendant‚Äôs
failure to obtain permission from organizations such
as licensing and collection societies for authors and
publishers may severely erode the likelihood of a
successful claim of fair dealing.33 From the evidence
provided so far it is unlikely that Google‚Äôs use is
transformative, and the claim that section 107 applies
in its favour will be refused.

4. The Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act 1988
The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 estab-
lishes property rights over works in which copyright
subsists. Section 1(1) provides that copyright subsists
in literary works. Under sections 2(2) and 2(6)
authors or owners of literary works such as books
have exclusive rights, for example, to reproduce those
works in any material form, publish the work, and
perform it in public. These rights of exclusivity under
the Copyright and Related Rights Regulation 2003
now extend the copyright owner‚Äôs control over
the communication of the work to the public by
electronic transmissions.34 For example, accessing
information through a search engine is arguably a
form of communication to the public and gives rise
to proprietorial claims should search engine opera-
tors utilize works protected by copyright. Informa-
tion disclosed through a search is a form of making
available to the public because online users can now
access it from a place and at a time individually cho-
sen by them. Communication to the public would
also include ‚Äòbroadcasts‚Äô. Section 6 of the 1988 Act

adopts
Accessing copyright works through a mobile phone,
wireless network, or computer connected to the
internet would now come within the scope of this
section.35

Section 30 of

the 1988 Act provides

speciÔ¨Åc
defences to an action for copyright infringement,
there being no general defence of fair dealing in the
United Kingdom. Two key legal and evidentiary
burdens must be met. Any dealing with the work
must be fair and the dealing must have been under-
taken in the speciÔ¨Åc instances identiÔ¨Åed by the 1988
Act. In Fraser-Woodward Ltd v British Broadcasting
Corporation Mr Justice Mann indicated that whether
the dealing was fair would be an issue of impression:
the motive of the person using the copyright work
would be a relevant factor.36 The implication is that
the defence may be denied to a defendant if the con-
duct or purpose of the use was shown to be improper
or unfair.37 The absence of a general defence of
fair dealing is signiÔ¨Åcant since Google cannot bring
themselves within any of the context-speciÔ¨Åc defences
available under section 30.38 For example, under sec-
tion 30(1) the exemption to copyright infringement
will be available only where the defendant shows
that
the dealing with the work was undertaken
for the purpose of criticism or review of that or
another work or of a performance of a work. Further,
with the exception of section 171(3), the section
30 exemptions
to commercial
organizations.

are unavailable

The main area of argument over the Google Print
dispute is likely to revolve around the applicability
of section 171(3). This section provides that ‚ÄòNothing
in this part affects any rule of law preventing or
restricting the enforcement of copyright, on grounds
of public interest or otherwise‚Äô. The incorporation

35 The act of making available through a technological process such as
caching and passive transmission would not be covered. Under Art 5(1)
of the Copyright Directive, acts of reproduction which are an integral
and essential part of the technological process with no independent
economic significance (contrast eg with a Napster client‚Äìserver model)
are deemed not to give rise to copyright infringement liability. See also
the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2013).

37 Hubbard v Vosper [1972] 2 QB 84, Associated Newspapers Group plc v News

of Article 10 of the European Convention of Human
Rights into the Human Rights Act 1998 is regarded
by some as providing the judiciary with the statutory
authority to resuscitate the dormant public interest
defence in copyright law.39 One line of argument is
that the exercise of copyright to prevent Google from
scanning the collection of works held in the libraries
would be inconsistent with the human right to access
to information and freedom of expression.40 Such an
argument is intended to persuade the court to adopt
the view that the monopoly vested in the copyright
owners is detrimental to the public interest in having
access to the collections held in the libraries.

The judiciary have shown a willingness to prevent
or restrict claims for equitable relief in cases involving
breach of conÔ¨Ådence on the grounds of public
interest.41 For example,
in Harrods Ltd v Times
Newspapers Ltd the Court of Appeal held that an
action for breach of conÔ¨Ådence could not be invoked
to protect iniquity.42 Current judicial deliberations
suggest that the characterization of the public interest
in these terms would be unlikely to succeed. In R (on
the application of ProLife Alliance) v BBC the House of
Lords acknowledged that the Human Rights Act 1998
did envisage the role of the law in protecting the free-
dom of expression.43 The House, however, suggested
that
justify the imposition of
conditions or restrictions on the rights of a party. A
similarly cautious stance was taken by the Court
in Ashdown v Telegraph.44 The policy
of Appeal
informing the court‚Äôs attitude to the public interest
argument
substantive
rules and norms will provide the commencing
point for analysis, in which context the fact Google
Print did not seek a licence (as the Authors Licens-
ing and Collection Society points out) may be
signiÔ¨Åcant.

5. Copyright reforms: the
problem of institutional design
The copyright issues raised by the Google Print dispute
resemble those facing businesses whose principal prod-
uct and revenue streams are derived from controlling
the channels for production and distribution of digital
content. Technological and legal instruments such as
contracts are increasingly used to resolve what,
in
essence, are business issues about how digital content is
to be accessed. Parallels can, for example, be drawn
between the issues raised in Google Print and the chal-
lenges facing the music industry. Market dominance is
inextricably linked to the ability to control the product
and revenue streams. Contractual terms ensure that the
channels for production and distribution are not com-
promised. Technological protection measures embedded
in digital works aim to enforce copyright rules in the
digital environment. Unauthorized acts of reproduction
or copying have important ramiÔ¨Åcations for the way the
economic and legal relations are structured.45

commitment

anti-circumvention of

Another development to bear in mind is the polit-
ical
to providing knowledge-based
industries with supportive regulatory infrastructures.
The swift enactment of the Copyright and Related
Rights Regulations 2003, the introduction of legisla-
tion criminalizing
rights
management technologies, and the economic impera-
tives informing the Gowers Review suggest that the
law will continue to perform a supportive role in
knowledge-based industries.46 This is not surprising.
Employment in industries reliant on solid intellectual
property rights infrastructures continues to rise.47 For
example in the United States 11.5 million jobs are
attributed to creative industries. A WIPO study has
also commented on similar macro and micro patterns
in the MERCOSUR countries.48 Foreign sales and
exports from the United States in 2002 amounted to
US$89.26 billion.49 More recently, the UK govern-
ment has pointed to the importance of protecting

There is, however, more to the Google Print dispute
than the issue of prior permission. At the normative
level there are intense debates about the general direc-
tion of institutional reform. The principal area of con-
tention which they highlight
the deep-seated
disagreement over the practical and normative aspects
of designing institutional infrastructures that balance
the diverse interests and goals of rights holders and
stakeholders in the information economy.51 At a prac-
tical level, fair and workable solutions are being sought
for a balanced framework appropriate for the digital
environment. It has been suggested that a public fund-
ing mechanism would help alleviate copyright owners‚Äô
concerns regarding piracy. This is, however, a form of
indirect taxation, which assumes that there is a univer-
sal or homogeneous set of works that merit subsidy
owing to public interest.52 Those engaged in ‚Äòhigh cul-
ture‚Äô may feel aggrieved at having their taxes subsidize
popular or chart music. Another proposal, that of inte-
grating the private entitlement regime within the pub-
lic welfare framework,53 does not address sufÔ¨Åciently
the question of how consensus is to be reached
with regard to applicable benchmarks, and what might
be the reasons for treating books, music, and entertain-
ment as meriting state intervention when infrastruc-
tures relating to education, health, and transport (all
deserving causes) gradually move in the opposite direc-
tion through the establishment of policies that empha-
size the ordering role of market norms and rules.

Despite the complexity of the governance chal-
lenges, numerous developments suggest that busi-
nesses in particular may wish to re-examine their
business models and instruments used for increasing
access to digital content. There are early signs that
businesses are beginning to adapt to the digital envi-
ronment. The origins of the paradigm shift can be

the internet is nothing more than hardware and software,
it has now become a medium for cultural expression and
coordination. Open standards for communication, ease
of access, and the relatively low cost of computers and
broadband have led to an explosion of creativity and cul-
tural expression. For example, communities such as
copyleft, the culture of blogging, and the spread of web-
sites incorporating the creative commons licence can be
seen as marking an important trend towards the gradual
empowerment of consumers and users. Rather than Ô¨Åx
our sights solely on how users‚Äô interests are being com-
promised by the commodiÔ¨Åcation of the information
commons, we could reÔ¨Çect on the numerous opportuni-
ties for collaboration, creativity, and expression that the
internet now makes possible.54 To be sure, the process
of peer production of a vibrant information commons
is well under way.55 Wikipedia, an international web-
based free-content encyclopaedia project, enables many
individuals to engage in collaborative activities. MySpa-
ce.com provides a social networking service. Users of
the service can now create and share musical works or
works of authorship. We can, for example, see the devel-
opments in the way music is accessed and consumed
without relying on the coercive facilities of copyright
law. An online user who visits the Napster site is pre-
sented with a set of choices and options. Subscribers to
online music sites such as Napster can now access a mil-
lion tracks of music, have at their disposal interactive
radio stations, and can share music Ô¨Åles with other sub-
scribers.

Google‚Äôs attempts to corner the market in information
sourcing through search engine functionality marks the
Ô¨Årst wave of challenges for copyright. Microsoft is plan-

ning to scan about 100,000 out-of-copyright books
held by the British Library and place them online.56
The Open Content Alliance has a similar goal of making
available classic books online.57 The willingness of busi-
nesses to adopt business models that correspond to
‚Äòsoft‚Äô norms, the emergence of open access publishing,
and creative commons suggest that orthodox business
models have to rethink how copyright and licensing
strategies may best enable them to innovate and better
address the needs of consumers. In respect of the book
and publishing industries, businesses currently relying
on copyright cannot marginalize the signiÔ¨Åcance of the
digital environment for business models.

6. Generative infrastructure leads
the way
This article has attempted to redress the current
imbalance in the debates over institutional design
and copyright law. By conceptualizing the problem
of institutional design in its empirical context, it pro-
poses that the decentralized architecture and open
communication protocols facilitate a range of oppor-
tunities for expression, creativity, and coordination.
As Castells reminds us:58

Networks have extraordinary advantages as organizing
tools because of their inherent flexibility and adapt-
ability, critical features in order to survive and prosper
in a fast-changing environment. That is why networks
are proliferating in all domains of the economy and
society, outcompeting and outperforming vertically
organized corporations and centralized bureaucracies.

An overemphasis of the shortcomings of our formal
institutions of governance may unwittingly distract
us from recognizing that copyright law, like markets,
is ultimately socially constituted. By focusing on the
generative architecture of the internet, we should
spend more time reÔ¨Çecting on what managing com-
plex information systems entails as we strive to design
effective and fair institutions.
