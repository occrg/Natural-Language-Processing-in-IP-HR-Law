Biobank-related research and intellectual
property rights: deconstructing the obscurity
Rajam Neethu*

I. Introduction

Biobanking and Big Data have become prominent terms.
Biobanks are deÔ¨Åned as collections of samples of human
bodily substances that are or can be associated with per-
sonal data and information relating to their donors.
Examples of bodily substances are cells, tissue and blood,
as well as DNA as the physical medium of genetic infor-
mation.1 The scale at which it is possible to collect, store
and analyse such information has been commonly referred
to as Big Data.2 However the actual connotation of Big
Data takes different forms based on the nature of the Ô¨Åeld
of exploration, eg computer science, Ô¨Ånancial analytics,
business or genomics.3 This article limits the exploration
of Big Data to the Ô¨Åeld of genomic studies and its associ-
ated health research. Large-volume correlation analysis is
made possible using biobanks, which in fact Ô¨Åll the gap
between the clinical and biological data.4 While acknowl-
edging the importance of algorithmic data as an essential
constituent of biobanks, this article limits its examination
to issues facing the exploitation of samples stored in bio-
banks for medical research. As a result, discussion of geno-
mic research in Big Data in the current context essentially
entails a discussion of human subjects and how their data
would ethically be handled during research.

The beginning of systematic collections of human cells
and tissues dates back to the eighteenth century and in-
cludes Ô¨Åxed, processed as well as frozen viable and non-
viable materials.5 In Europe, however, the mushrooming
of biobanks is a fairly recent phenomenon which began
approximately a decade ago. Though frozen samples were
stored in many laboratories, they were not a standardized
collection that could be regarded as a biobank. It has been
the growth in scientiÔ¨Åc technology and increased possibili-
ties to store biological data from large cohorts that has

ipants under the lens of IP law. While IP law policies
tend to focus on the promotion of innovation, the
contextual discussion on biobanks also calls for the
consideration of ethical aspects.

‚ÄòBiobanks for research‚Äô, German National Ethics Council, 2004; Biobank refers
to the structure, while biobanking essentially means the technology involved in
the storing of samples and data. A biobank is also commonly referred to as a
biorepository, repository or tissue bank, which simply refers to a collection of
biospecimens and their associated data. A biobank can be comprised of hu-
man, animal or environmental (eg seeds, viruses, soil, etc) biospecimens.

When they are limited in point of time, like a speciÔ¨Åc cohort, it is referred as a
biorepository by some, however, a strict distinction does not exist between the
two terms. Eg, See Article 3 III, Ordinance No. 2,201 of 2011 Brazil.

enabled the new systematic approach to biobanking.6
These changes have provided systematic approaches to un-
derstand disease patterns and formulate new pathways for
personalized medicine. In 2006 the European Strategy
Forum on Resource Infrastructures (ESFRI)7 recognized
the importance of biobanks as a strategic resource infra-
structure to bridge the gap created in basic discovery and
translation into medical products and applications. The
Biobanking
resources Research
Infrastructure (BBMRI) was a result of this realization.
Since its inception in 2008 the BBMRI has adopted several
initiatives to create a more formalized biobanking struc-
ture that would act as a resource for biomedical research.

Biomolecular

and

The deÔ¨Ånition of biobanks, as discussed earlier,
encompasses two sets of
information stemming from
their technological base8: the samples and the data. These
can largely help researchers to secure an analysis of the
samples ‚Äòas such‚Äô, eg where the samples are part of a pop-
ulation collection or under a speciÔ¨Åc investigation cohort.
The same set of samples may be also used for other re-
search purposes, eg diabetes studies in coeliac patients.
Population studies, hospital collections and clinical studies
broadly form the basis of biological collections and are
popularly referred to as the ‚ÄòBig Data‚Äô of health. They con-
tain various subsets of genomic and proteomic data, dif-
ferent types of samples, multiple aliquots relating to
disease groups or at times they may be linked with hospi-
tals or clinics. Much of the actual usage of these Big Data
relating to health research is still unknown and often
apprehensions about this ‚Äòunknown‚Äô part informs the dis-
cussion relating to concerns over the potential uses and

application of biorepositories.9 While public investments
in such endeavours have as their ultimate goal the foster-
ing of advanced research and innovation for better health
care systems, the exploitation of these resources presents
some challenges. The main concern for donors and pa-
tients is the ‚Äòun-conceived‚Äô exploitation of biobank data.10
Researchers may use relevant information along with the
samples collected by a biobank to further their own Ô¨Ånd-
ings, thereby giving a starting point for research. IP rights
come into consideration when research results need to be
transformed into factual applications in order to exploit
the research possibilities fully. Biobanks are often caught
directly between the values relating to medical research
and the potential commercial and scientiÔ¨Åc value of such
Big Data. Initial concerns raised by relevant literature in
this Ô¨Åeld have related to the issue of consent11 with respect
to the use of samples and also underuse of biological re-
sources held by biobanks.12 But with more research proj-
ects being Ô¨Çoated within such repositories, concerns have
shifted to IP rights and their management, particularly
over standards relating to exchange and data-sharing poli-
cies.13 The importance attached to research using human
biological materials
also reÔ¨Çected in the new
Recommendation CM/Rec (2016)614 on research on bio-
logical materials of human origin, examined in this article.
This article considers three main challenges in bio-

is

bank-related research:

(a) property laws;

(b) IP rights; and
(c) ethics.15

10 Biobanks may involve a variety of data. It is not essential that all bio-

banks are related to a health database. The contents of the biobank vary
based on its nature and purpose. It is to be noted that all data related to
donors come within the purview of the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 27 April 2016, which repeals the earlier Directive 95/46/EC.
Under the new regulation, special exemptions are provided for scientiÔ¨Åc
archives and in the interest of public health. The notion of ‚Äòun-conceived
usage‚Äô means that it is unconceived by the donors at the time of donating
the samples. It is a legally valid usage but based on the nature of consent
followed under national law and does not mean violations of the laws of
Data Protection (see footnotes 34‚Äì36 for related discussion on the point).

Rajam Neethu  Biobank-related research and intellectual property rights

ARTICLE

309

Biobanks consist of a combination of genetics, tissues,
health treatment and patients or donors. The governance
of a resource infrastructure within such a conglomerate
paradigm has found unsettled equations within traditional
property rights.16 Control over ideational or intellectual as-
pects on the other hand is regulated by IP rights.17 In the
context of biobank-based research activities, the discourse
on IP rights has often stemmed from the traditional con-
cept of property as control over resources. This approach
has resulted from an ethical discourse primarily focused
on the participants to such research.18 For instance how
are issues of ownership over samples and ownership over
intellectual efforts dealt with in the context of biobanks?
Does IP law act as an enabler or restrictor in biobank-
based research? Does bioethics allow balancing them out?

Rights over intellectual creations

Human biological materials including human tissues
stored in a repository evolve out of a process that goes
from collection, storage and preservation to research
and use for industrial purposes. The fact that these ‚ÄòBig‚Äô
datasets have great economic value requires a functional
balance between the aims of biobanks, spontaneous do-
nations and the notion of public good.19 Biobanking as
a system enables the transfer of bio specimens from the
donor to the repository with altruistic motives or in the
interest of research, the result of which may be beneÔ¨Å-
cial to the patient or for others suffering from a similar
situation as the donor. However, difÔ¨Åculties arise when
the use of a donated sample is extended beyond those
that were considered by the donor, eg where there is a
broad consent from the donors. In this context two in-
terrelated tensions arise: one relating to legal ownership
over the donated biological material, and the other re-
lating to IP rights connected with the research results
obtained by using such materials.

The traditional concept of ‚Äòownership‚Äô refers to an
exercise of complete dominion over things or claims
and gives the ‚Äòowner‚Äô a ‚Äòjus in rem‚Äô.20 Ownership rights

have often found an uncomfortable equation with hu-
man biological materials used in research and have
sought a distinction from the common law notions of
property.21 In the context of discussions over tissue
samples taken by research entities like biobanks, the
purpose of the biobank at hand often determines the
creation and use of the resources and‚Äîas a result‚Äîthe
nature and conceptualization of ownership may vary.
However, there is still a lack of consensus as to how
these concepts need to be governed.22 While some have
regarded the debate over ownership rights in genomic
research meaningless,23 others have considered it as the
basis to recognize different models of governance.24
SigniÔ¨Åcant parts of the literature on the apprehensions
relating to biobanks and its research uses tends to over-
lap the notions of patent ownership and ownership of
the tissue samples per se. The concept of ownership of
tissues is a matter which has been under the purview of
national
legislation. The Anglo-Saxon tradition has
been the ‚Äòwork and skill‚Äô test to determine the excep-
tions to the rule that the human body and its separated
body parts lack proprietary status.25 This entails that
sufÔ¨Åcient amount of skill and labour invested in pro-
curing and preserving body parts could lead to limited
possessory rights devoid of commercial usages. This ap-
proach has been signiÔ¨Åcantly
an
Australian High Court decision.26 In R v Kelly27 this ex-
ception was acknowledged as conferring on the right-
holder the simple right to continue possessing the body
part, while making it possible for the state to prosecute
its theft. However, it did not offer any right to sell,
transfer or proÔ¨Åt from such processed human biological
parts. Common law tradition has focused on criminal
prosecutions pertaining to human biological materials
taken from corpse and has not distinguished between
samples taken from corpses and samples from living
human bodies, despite having had such an opportunity
in the Diane Blood case.28 There the Court of Appeal of
England and Wales refused to examine the legality of
the sperm taken from an unconscious spouse without

biological samples this cannot sit well because all rights under a tradi-
tional notion of ownership cannot be exercised.

express consent in the interest of the appellant‚Äôs wish to
conceive a child from her husband. Rather, the cases fo-
cused on other ethical implications, notably bearing a
child conceived with a neurologically dead person. The
debate over ownership of body parts has been extensive
and is not within the scope of this article. However, ref-
erence to it serves to highlight the debate over the con-
cept of ownership ‚Äòper se‚Äô and the exploitation of
research results. In other words, the question as to
whether tissues can be property per se is different from
the question as to how research results can be pro-
tected, eg where the samples used in the research cohort
arise from a biorepository. Patent law protects the func-
tionality as disclosed from the technical disclosure and
thus does not concern itself with the proprietary rights
of tissues or cells.29 There are several instances from the
United States which reÔ¨Çect this conÔ¨Çict, though stem-
ming from a patent landscape. For instance in Moore v
Regents of the University of California,30 the question
was whether Moore retained any property rights in the
‚ÄòMo cell line‚Äô, which was derived from Moore‚Äôs spleen
and was subsequently patented. The Supreme Court of
California rejected Moore‚Äôs claim for conversion,
thereby dismissing any property claims in the sample
taken from Moore during his surgery. Another signiÔ¨Å-
cant case is that of HeLa cells, these being the most
widely used model cell line for studying human cellular
and molecular biology. Application as a model organ-
ism has contributed to the characterization of impor-
tant biological processes
than 70,000
publications and 11,000 patent applications.31 The cell
line originated from a cervical cancer tumour of a pa-
tient named Henrietta Lacks, who later died of cancer
in 1951.32 This key example is illustrative of the con-
cerns that may arise in the context of biobanks, particu-
larly in respect of ownership rights. Concerns over the
exploitation of donated tissues without proper consent
often culminate in claims of ownership rights over the
samples. In a fairly recent case, a Canadian court has
ruled that

personal property but it does not form part of the per-
son from whom it came because it belongs to hospitals
as part of the medical record‚Äô.33 This does not necessar-
ily mean that donors do not have a say in how their
samples ought to be used. In Gudmundsdottir v The
State of Iceland,34 the Icelandic Supreme Court held
that the daughter of a deceased man could prevent his
health information from being entered into the Health
Sector Database.35 Along similar lines, the European
Court of Human Rights has held that taking tissues
without proper assessment of consent and by not in-
forming the spouse of the deceased, thus depriving the
exercise of certain rights established under domestic
law‚Äînotably the right to express consent or refusal in
relation to the removal of relevant tissue‚Äîwas a viola-
tion of the surviving spouse‚Äôs right to privacy under
Article 8 of the European Human Rights Convention.36
In addition, the anguish suffered by the wife in Ô¨Ånding
out about the removal of some of her husband‚Äôs body
parts was considered in itself a violation of human dig-
nity.37 In another instance, the European Court of
Human Rights held that the retention of the applicant‚Äôs
Ô¨Ångerprint information, after all charges against her
were dropped, infringed her right to privacy.38 From
this case law it appears that the interrelated concepts of
privacy and autonomy are uniÔ¨Åed at a more fundamen-
tal level by consideration that each reÔ¨Çects a valued as-
pect of human personality and is visible in the context
of physical samples.39 This is in line with the analogy
taken in a different context in Google Spain SL, Google
Inc. v Agencia Espa~nola de Proteccion de Datos, Mario
Costeja Gonzalez,40 in which the Court of Justice of the
European Union held that an individual may request to
have relevant information pertaining to him delisted from a
search engine even if ‚Äòthose rights override, the economic
interest of the operator‚Äô.41 Overall, while ‚Äòjus in rem‚Äô gov-
erns ownership rights over excised biological samples, there
exists ‚Äòjus in personam‚Äô in respect of the individual‚Äôs right
over the use of his biological samples.42.This in fact has
been the basis for debate over the issue of the various types

of informed consent originally mooted by Convention on
Human Rights and Biomedicine.43

The above discussion provides two important inferences
in the context of biobanking: the donor may choose what
use (if any) will be made of his samples, also because one‚Äôs
own right to self-determination is a fundamental right in it-
self;44 health researchers will be able to achieve the goals of
medical research only if their research falls within standard-
ized norms of consent and respect for privacy. From a dif-
ferent angle, one might argue that this also implies that,
once donated on the basis of informed consent (irrespective
of the type of consent) following a standard protocol, a do-
nor may not be able to make further claims in respect of the
use of sample in research. However, withdrawal of samples
from the research is possible in light of privacy consider-
ations as referred to above. It might not be possible for the
donor to make a claim (including IP-related) on the sample
as such.45 However, often balancing the public outlook
might be difÔ¨Åcult at the cost of even dissolving the biobank.
For instance, failure of the Icelandic biobanking cohort in-
volving private company deCode is an example which of
how the Icelandic Government failed to address the various
concerns relating to uses of the samples taken from
Icelanders.46 This means that, while there may no longer be
proprietary rights post-donation of tissues, there may still
be limited rights of other kinds.47 In addition the ‚Äòuse‚Äô, ‚Äòex-
change‚Äô and ‚Äòtransfer‚Äô of such Big Data to researchers out-
side the facility or even across borders can be a challenge to
any discourse around ownership. This calls for due dili-
gence on the part of governing bodies and ethics commit-
tees in biorepositories. It may be essential for biobanks to
build a cooperative and productive framework to address
these issues by taking into consideration the substantive
public engagement in the existence of biobanks.48

II. IP rights and biobanks

A. IP rights and possibilities within biobanks

As discussed above, the importance of biomedical re-
search drives the creation of research infrastructures. In

innovations.49 Analogous

the context of medical research, the impact of IP rights
can be seen as a multi-cyclic chain (Fig. 1 Annex). The in-
novation cycle is in fact a continuous process of discovery,
validation development, registration and commercializa-
tion, leading to the creation of value which can be rein-
vested in further
to the
innovation cycle, the biobanks also form part of a research
cycle by acting as a facilitator of information. Pathmasiri
et al.50 considers that within the life of biobanks there are
three different phases, ie the creation, collection and ac-
cess phases. Just as the innovation cycle has ‚Äòresearch con-
cept‚Äô as its focal point, the purpose of the collection
governs the structure and purpose framework of the bio-
bank at issue. In case of standalone biobanks with inde-
pendent collections, it is possible that there could only be
two phases, ie the creation and collection phases. Access
in such cases depends on a researcher‚Äôs research project
that is using the sample from the biobank. In this way
they may only act as catalyst within a bigger innovation
cycle. Within these phases there could be an upstream
phase where mostly sample study and analysis is con-
ducted for the creation of a collection. Then the actual
collection and processing of data originates the repository.
This technically qualiÔ¨Åes as the upstream phase in the life
of a biobank.51 The downstream phase begins wherein the
researchers working with speciÔ¨Åc disease investigations
may use the sample collected by the biobanks for the pur-
poses of their research projects. Interestingly each of these
phases may involve different IP considerations.

i. Patents
The upstream phase of a biobank, ie the creation and col-
lection phases, may be characterized by patents for innova-
tion equipment for sample collection and storage, eg
sample processors or lab automation units that help to
process the sample and also generate automated data from
the wet samples as they are being processed. The upstream
phase may be also subject to patents for certain products
used in research, eg cell lines that may be used for various
research purposes

requirements to be considered an invention. In addition,
processes relating to the extraction of certain samples for
speciÔ¨Åc cohorts could also qualify for patenting, eg extrac-
tion and storage of spinal Ô¨Çuid for speciÔ¨Åc studies. The
downstream research using samples leading to qualitative
research outcomes may be patented as well. In Europe the
relevant legislative framework appears fairly homogeneous
in relation to donation of tissues,52 blood53 and organs54
in the context of the quality and safety framework which
deÔ¨Ånes the parameters of all stages of the chain from dona-
tion to transplantation. However, these legal frameworks
do not address research using human tissues and cells
when used for purposes other than application to the hu-
man body.55 The European intellectual property regime
partially covers the use of human genetic materials in med-
ical research, both through legal framework and decisions
of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

the European Patent
Convention (EPC)56 and the Directive on the legal protec-
tion of biotechnological inventions, popularly called the
Biotech Directive.57 The EPC approach to inventions is
non-discriminatory and reÔ¨Çects Article 27 of TRIPS.58
Irrespective of the nature of technology, an invention that
is new,
industrial application
would qualify for protection.59 However, the EPC does
not contain speciÔ¨Åc provisions concerning the patentability
of human biological materials,60 such as, for instance, hu-
man cell lines.61 Lack of clarity as regards biotechnological
inventions led to the adoption of the Directive. This con-
siders elements isolated from the human body or other-
wise produced by means of a technical process to be a
patentable invention even if the structure of that element
is identical to that of a natural element.62

In International Stem Cell Corporation v Comptroller
General of Patents63 in relation to Article 5(1) of the

Directive the CJEU held that, ‚Äòwhile the human body at
the various stages of its formation and the simple discov-
ery of one of its elements are not patentable, an element
isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by
means of a technical process can be patented‚Äô.64

In T 0080/05,65 the EPO had to consider a method
for diagnosing a predisposition for breast and ovarian
cancer in a human subject.66 Opponents67 to the patent
alleged that methods disclosed in the application were
not patentable as per Article 52 (2) (a) EPC and Article
52 (2) (c) EPC because they were based on a discovery
of a mutation and discovery of relationship that exists
in nature between mutation and disease. It was also
contented by the opponents to the patent that it was a
purely mental act that a human having this mutation
has a predisposition to the disease. The opponents also
referred to Article 53(c) EPC, which states that patents
shall not be granted for diagnostic methods practiced
on the human or animal body. However, the EPO
Board of Appeal noted that ‚Äòan element isolated from
the human body or otherwise produced by means of a
technical process may constitute a patentable invention.
This Ô¨Ånding applies to claims relating to products, ie
genes, and is a fortiori applicable to the method claims
here at issue‚Äô.68 Moreover, the Board held that subject
matter not a mental act because the features of the
claims are considered as requiring working steps of
technical nature. Further, the methods claimed were of
a technical nature and were performed on a tissue sam-
ple of a human subject and not on a human subject per
se and are therefore patentable.69

reports or publications forming a part of the content of
the biobank database and the substantial investment
put in creating the biobank that would be protected un-
der the Database Directive 96/9/EC70 as a sui generis
right. The latter protects any investment put into ob-
taining, verifying or presenting the contents of the data-
base having a minimum level of originality.71 The value
of biobanks lies in the biological samples they collect
and the genetic data contained therein.72 The invest-
ments that go into ‚Äòobtaining‚Äô and ‚Äòverifying‚Äô the con-
tents of a database, which in this case would be the
genetic samples from the participants and their associ-
ated primary data, should secure protection under the
Database Directive.73 The term of protection of the sui
generis rights is 15 years. However, when the database
is modiÔ¨Åed in a substantial way (evaluated qualitatively
or quantitatively) to the contents of a database it gives
rise to a fresh term of 15 years for the database.74 Thus
for biobanks to which new information or collections
are added, it could be easier to obtain extended periods
of protection.

iii. Trade marks
Trade mark law might also be relevant in the context
of biobanks. Trade mark registration is available to
signs that can be represented graphically and distin-
guish the goods or services of one undertaking from
those of another. Trade marks serve as indicators of
business origin, and may consist of words,
logos,
devices or other distinctive features such as colours
or shapes, or a combination of these.75 Biobanks
may beneÔ¨Åt from protecting their identity through
their name and logos in order to build a brand value
over time.

a piece of information that meets certain requirements
under Directive 2016/943,77 such as (a) it is secret that
it is not known among or readily accessible to persons
within the circles that normally deal with it; (b) it has
commercial value because it is secret; (c) it has been
subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by
the person lawfully in control of the information, to
keep it secret.78 A trade secret model for biobanks has
been proposed by some authors79 on the belief that it
would help remove the ambiguity and misunderstand-
ing surrounding the respective rights and obligations of
contributors, biobanks, researchers and their institu-
tions alike under the current regimes of informed con-
sent. A trade secret model aims to use contracts to
deÔ¨Åne the relationship between various parties in-
volved, ie donors, biobanks and researchers in the con-
text of biobanks.80 While this is a laudable move in
terms of alternative strategies to the issues of consent, it
may not Ô¨Ånd many followers in Europe. This is the case
because it tends to undermine a key principle in the
Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine,81 ie,
‚ÄòThe human body and its parts shall not ‚Äúas such‚Äù give
rise to Ô¨Ånancial gain‚Äô and using the trade secret would
mean a commerce or enterprise in genes from an ethi-
cal point of view which is not the direction to be fol-
lowed for biobanks.82 However,
it would still be
possible for biobanks to use trade secrets in the various
techniques employed by them‚Äîsuch as extraction pro-
cesses for samples‚Äîand would serve as an alternative
to patents, which may be costly for publicly funded bio-
banks to maintain.

This requires one to consider two further aspects: the ex-
tent to which a biobank can claim a share in the research
results that are protected through IP rights; and the ethi-
cal question facing IP protection for this kind of re-
search. The Ô¨Årst aspect has often been considered
negatively in scholarly discussion.83 However, where bio-
banks get involved with a special process for securing
samples for the research or where they co-fund such re-
search projects, biobanks could in fact claim a share in
the IP rights emanating from such research.

While a functional analysis could help in clarifying
the protection of research results, the ethical aspect of
‚Äòpre-patent‚Äô biobank research remains a matter of con-
cern. There is no doubt that the use of samples and
data held by these repositories are put to rigorous scru-
tiny by relevant ethics committees or boards. However,
it is still not possible to trace the IP applications using a
biobank‚Äôs sample, which has the effect of holding up
other research using similar samples from the biobank
or where the exploitation of a patent research result is
made in unwarranted ways. The role of the ethics com-
mittees is limited to the ‚Äòactual use‚Äô of samples and not
to the potential exploitation of IP rights.

IP law itself only allows for a limited consideration

of this issue.

On the technical front, patentability of an invention
might be validly excluded on grounds of ‚Äòordre public‚Äô
or ‚Äòmorality‚Äô in order to protect human, animal plant
life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the envi-
ronment.84 This standard cut-off exemption has been
indicated as an effective solution.85 This approach un-
der TRIPS has been effectively adopted under Art.53 (a)
EPC. The purpose of this provision under the EPC is to
deny patent protection to inventions likely to induce
riot or public disorder, or to lead to criminal or other
generally offensive behaviour.86 Some of the examples
offered by the examination guidelines of EPO87 tend to
throw some light on this, such as incitement to riot or
acts of disorder;
to criminal acts; racial,

incitement

such invention.

similar discriminatory propaganda; and
religious or
grossly obscene matter. This provision of law, apart from
forming a ‚Äòblanket clause‚Äô that is framed to accommo-
date future developments, constitutes a ‚Äòfundamental
and high-ranking norm‚Äô that is ‚Äòfuture-proof in the
sense of being technology neutral‚Äô.88 The approach
taken under the EPC differs from the one under TRIPS,
in relation to which a ‚Äònecessity‚Äô test requires an assess-
ment of the necessity in preventing the commercial ex-
ploitation of
such
exclusion cannot apply merely because of a prohibition
in the law. With respect to biotech inventions, Rule 28
of the Implementing Regulation offers examples from
the Ô¨Åeld of biotechnology that potentially gives rise to
an objection under the ‚Äòordre public‚Äô and morality
clause.89 The correct approach to Rule 28(c) of imple-
menting regulation, as per the enlarged board of appeal
in Warf case,90 is to identify the claimed monopoly and
ask whether that monopoly embraces the exceptions
mentioned under the provision.91 Rule 29(2),92 how-
ever, deÔ¨Ånes which biological material originating from
the human body may be patented. It states that:

In any case,

An element isolated from the human body or otherwise
produced by means of a technical process including the se-
quence or partial sequence of a gene may constitute a pat-
entable invention, even if the structure of that element is
identical to that of a natural element.

This position under Rule 29(2) is resounded under
Art.5 (2) of the Biotech Directive.93 In Howard Florey94
(The Relaxin case) the EPO observed that exclusion
from patentability on these grounds would be only pos-
sible if the invention at issue was regarded as universally
outrageous. In that case DNA as such was not regarded
as life but rather as one of the many chemical entities
participating in biological processes. Hence no offence
to human dignity had occurred, also considering that
the donor of the relevant tissue has been asked for her
consent and her self-determination was not affected by

the exploitation of the claimed molecules.95 While sam-
ples isolated from the human body by a technical pro-
cess might not be treated as offensive of the ‚Äòordre
public‚Äô and morality clause per se, what would really be
a matter of concern would be the issue of self-
determination. This is exactly the concern reÔ¨Çected in
the case law discussed above in the context of owner-
ship of human biological materials. Respect for auton-
omy is one of the basic ethical principles as far as
biobanks and their research activities are concerned.
The right to freely and voluntarily decide whether or
not to participate in medical research is now universally
accepted as a standard principle which is strengthened
further in international covenants like the Helsinki
Declaration on Biomedical Research,96
the Oviedo
Convention97
and the Universal Declaration on
Bioethics and Human Rights.98 Thus, it was not sur-
prising when the special Eurobarometer survey of 2010
reported that even though only a third (34%) of
Europeans had heard of biobanks, the majority (67%)
of them felt that researchers should ask for permission
for every new piece of research to be conducted. The
question as to the ethical implication of a patentable in-
vention has to be distinguished from the ethical impli-
cations facing the research leading to the invention.99
However, this distinction often seems to be entangled
in the discussions relating to the patentability of human
tissues. This was, for instance, the case in John Moore v
Regents of the University of California.100 The concern
raised therein was
recognized by the Californian
Supreme Court when it sought to reconcile the concept
of ‚ÄòÔ¨Åduciary duty‚Äô with the need to seek a patient‚Äôs con-
sent for a medical procedure through an informed con-
sent by disclosing any personal interest of the doctor
unrelated to the patient‚Äôs health, whether research or
judgment.101
economic that may affect the medical
However the CJEU in the judgment in C-377/98,102
concerning the application for annulment of
the
Directive by The Netherlands, dealt with a similar issue
in a different way. The Kingdom of the Netherlands in
the case submitted that the absence in the Biotech
Directive of a provision requiring veriÔ¨Åcation of the

consent of the donor or recipient of products obtained
by biotechnological process would undermine the right
to self-determination. The court rejected this argument,
stating that reliance on the fundamental right of human
integrity was

clearly misplaced as against a directive which concerns only
the grant of patents and whose scope does not therefore ex-
tend to activities before and after that grant, whether they
involve research or the use of the patented products.103

The court furthermore stated that ‚Äòthe grant of a patent
does not preclude legal limitations or prohibitions ap-
plying to research into patentable products or the ex-
ploitation of patented products‚Äô.104 Though the views
in the Relaxin case and C-377/98 are different, what is
clear is that the Relaxin case enabled the EPO to use the
exclusion to regulate the conduct of pre-patent research
activities.105

In the context of biobanks, the discourse is essentially
distinct. This is so because the intended use of samples
for research is an essential component of the deÔ¨Ånition of
biobank itself.106 The very foundational basis for the crea-
tion of these collections is to enable them to become re-
search resource infrastructures. Consistent with this, the
issues raised in Moore and HeLa cell
line essentially
points towards the adherence of good research practices
and scientiÔ¨Åc integrity. While such instances tend to act
as harbingers of a structured research and IP policy for
publicly funded biobanks, they may not be beÔ¨Åtting ex-
amples in the given context. The current understanding
of the potential of biobanks has prompted an increased
standardization in the collection, storage and exploitation
of relevant resources. For instance, the UK biobank regis-
try clearly articulates in its aims the use of samples ‚Äòfor
improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a
wide range of serious and life-threatening illnesses ‚Äì in-
cluding cancer, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, arthritis,
osteoporosis, eye disorders, depression and forms of de-
mentia‚Äô.107 The aims of such repositories and the donor‚Äôs
aspiration can Ô¨Ånd homogeneity only through research
and development of facilities for the treatment of many
life-threatening diseases. The ‚Äòsubsequent use‚Äô of human

biological materials arises at the point of collection.108
The procedures followed during the collection phase gov-
ern the scope of the use of such resources. While stan-
dardizations of sample quality, form and analysis are
important for the full exploitation of the resources col-
lected in biobanks, it is also essential to standardize access
and use of the samples quite early on. This would ensure
transparency in research and protection of research re-
sults through patents. This is also beneÔ¨Åcial from an in-
dustrial point of view to follow the guidelines of use and
access outlined by a biobank to ensure clarity in research
purposes and outcomes. The strength or weakness of a
patent rests on the achievement of this clarity on the con-
Ô¨Çicting interests involved and not on account of the pat-
ent itself.109 However, there could be other factors that
are remotely connected to the ethics of patentability. For
instance, the examples of Tongan and Icelandic popula-
tion biobanks have shown that not all biobanks are well
received in the public opinion.110 European patent law is
interpreted and applied in a sufÔ¨Åciently rigorous manner
to ensure that
the human body effectively remains
unavailable and inalienable and that human dignity is
properly safeguarded.111 However, the important ques-
tion to ensure compliance with research ethics remains a
grey area. Although there is formally no restriction in the
scope of ‚Äòordre public and morality clause‚Äô to exclude bi-
ological materials taken in violation of human autonomy
and dignity, it has never been applied by the EPO. The
lack of clarity in this respect is bound to bring in the vi-
cious circle of debate over ownership and use of biologi-
cal materials in research.

III. Biobanking: a case for health care
participation

Unlocking life‚Äôs code through the Human Genome
Project has opened up unlimited possibilities for medical
diagnosis and early cure of diseases. Despite this, the

for

and

health

researchers

scientiÔ¨Åc community has been concerned that premature
patenting would slow down innovation and hinder drug
development.112 Thus, patenting per se is not a worry
but premature patenting is. These concerns were laid to
rest with the publication of all human genetic sequences
of the Human Genome Project in 2003 in the public do-
main.113 This has provided a valuable source of informa-
tion
pharmaceutical
companies alike.114 As new diagnostic methods and tools
are being discovered and new functions of biomarkers
being identiÔ¨Åed, researchers are now able to study what
an individual is predisposed to far in advance of any
health events for the individual.115 This is essential to
cure disease at the earliest opportunity or at times offer
preventive care such as, for instance, in relation to breast
and ovarian cancers. It is apparent that there is a high
scientiÔ¨Åc and commercial value for such samples. This
value creation also implies the endurance of biobanks to
offer samples and related information for potential re-
search. However, the task of mapping and exploiting
such data resources is not an easy one.116 ‚ÄòSustainability‚Äô
towards the ends of biobanks is indeed a major issue in
the functioning of a biobank. Studies conducted on do-
nors who contributed their biological materials for vari-
ous biobanks show that they do so only in the interest of
research results helping the common good.117 Often it is
seen that the donors are reluctant to participate in proj-
ects which are meant to be ‚Äòidle collections‚Äô, ie only for
the purposes of storage.118 What motivates public partic-
ipation in biobanks is indeed the greater good that could
emanate out of research using such collections. This is
essential in the interest of medical research and transla-
tion of research beneÔ¨Åts to the community, which is the
for the creation of biorepositories.119
ultimate goal
Besides all this, there exist multifaceted challenges in
terms of industrial partnerships, as well as multinational
collaborations where research initiatives are connected
across multiple international borders.120 Consequently

109 Example in the Relaxin case discussed above, the opposition to the claims
therein pointed out that taking tissue from a pregnant woman was an of-
fence to human dignity. However, the fact of consent from such pregnant
women was a strong foothold to the usage of such samples by the
Howard Florey Institute. Thus, while the patent may be new, inventive
and industrially applicable, it must also comply with standard practices
of research to ensure the stability of such patents.

Organisation
and
Development (OECD) guidelines on Human Biobanks
and Genetic Research Databases (HBGRDs), 2009,121
provide that the sharing of knowledge is one of the
most important beneÔ¨Åts to be derived from HBGRDs:
its operators should endeavour to foster the exchange
of information, technology and research through vari-
ous means including technology transfer, material trans-
fer,
joint research and development activities.
One of the several means to achieve the sustainability
of biobanking structures is to deÔ¨Åne the possible eco-
nomic models to secure diverse industrial and com-
mercial partnerships.122 There is a growing tendency to
secure private funding sources and involve industrial
partners in biobank-based research activities.123 While
balancing the two distinct clusters of economics and
ethics becomes a challenge, there is also a realization
that such industrial partnership in biobanks is no lon-
ger excludable in the interest of marketable health re-
search.124 As Baird points out ‚Äòas a society, we need to
think about the consequences, for health research as a
whole, of the strong focus on academic‚Äìindustry part-
nerships to produce marketable products‚Äô.125 Shifting
focus onto the commercial partnerships within bio-
banks brings forth some important questions, at least
from an intellectual property perspective as discussed
so far in this article.

In May 2016, a new set of recommendations to the
Council of Europe member states on the removal, stor-
age and use of biological materials for research pur-
poses was adopted by the Committee of Ministers.
Recommendation CM/Rec (2016)6 recognizes the value
of biomedical research for the advancement of health-
care and the improvement of the quality of life and at
the same time offers to protect the personal life of indi-
viduals who have contributed their samples for biomed-
ical research.126 The recommendation captures some of
the dilemmas highlighted in the discussions above. It
applies in the following situations:

(a) obtaining biological materials of human origin for

storage for future research purposes;

(b) storage of biological materials of human origin for

future research purposes;

(c) the use in a research project of biological materials
of human origin that are stored or were previously
obtained for another purpose, including a previous
research project; and

(d) associated personal data.127

recommendation

The
the Oviedo
Convention128 in declaring the human body and its
parts ‚Äòshall not ‚Äúas such‚Äù give rise to Ô¨Ånancial gain‚Äô.
Whilst doing so it also tries to factor in the needs of
medical researchers by requiring that appropriate con-
sent ought to be respected in using the biological mate-
rials for research purposes, particularly if
they are
identiÔ¨Åable. If the proposed use of identiÔ¨Åable biologi-
cal materials in a research project is not within the
scope of prior consent given by the person concerned,
efforts must be made to obtain such consent unless the
individual, at the time of offering her samples, ex-
pressed the wish not to be contacted.129 In situations in
which contacting a donor has been unsuccessful, the re-
search project may still be able to use the biological ma-
terials and data, where the research addresses an
important scientiÔ¨Åc interest and is in accordance with
the principle of proportionality. This means that the in-
terference with a fundamental right affected must be
proportional in relation to the legitimate interest pur-
sued by the researcher. Non-identiÔ¨Åable materials on
the other hand could be used in a research project pro-
vided that such use does not violate any restrictions de-
Ô¨Åned by the person concerned before the materials have
been rendered non-identiÔ¨Åable. The recommendation
thus applies to biorepositories which store human bio-
logical materials for potential future uses. While it sets
in a caution for usage of human biological materials,
the point of discussion stops at ‚Äòactual usage‚Äô of the
samples and is silent on the intellectual property rights
emerging from research projects using such materials.

fundamental rights of individuals becomes a matter of utmost
importance.

Also these guidelines offering general recommendation
are not legally binding.130 They ought to be more eas-
ily adapted to changing circumstances and realities of
biobanks today. This requires an in-depth reÔ¨Çection
on a more detailed policy on IP rights and the com-
mercial use of biological materials of human origin.
From a biobank perspective it is essential that the pros
and cons involved in IP rights, when applied to bio-
bank-based research, be fully understood in consider-
ing various strategies. Some biobanks in Europe have
begun to address these in research agreements and
MTAs (Material Transfer Agreements131) with research
collaborators.132 In considering some mechanisms to
address the concerns reÔ¨Çected above it is essential to
consider an IP policy that deÔ¨Ånes the ethical criterion
in accordance with the biobank concerns or which
mitigates the effect of a stricter application of patent
criteria. This apart, in research collaboration by bio-
banks with external partners, it may be possible to of-
fer non-exclusive licensing strategies wherein it would
be still possible for the biobanks to continue to exploit
the research results.133 It is also important for bio-
banks to seek patent laws research exemption which
will enable biobanks to continue with their research
activities without being hampered by a patent, for in-
stance. Thus, for biobanks, relevant IP policy needs to
be tailored to their structural framework and require-
ments while in keeping with some of the points that
are discussed above.

IV. Concluding remarks

The above analysis has sought to highlight three impor-
tant aspects.

First, the importance of public‚Äìprivate partnership
for the fruitful uses of resources which have been gath-
ered within the biobanks using huge amount of invest-
in its
ment. The WHO regional ofÔ¨Åce for Europe,
Guidelines on Genetic Databases,
the

states

that

partnership between public and private enterprises
would currently seem to be the optimal means to realize
public beneÔ¨Åt from research in genetics.134 It has also
been pointed out by the guidelines that the means by
which funding for research is provided should be less of
a concern; instead adequate safeguards are to be insti-
tuted to ensure that the public beneÔ¨Åt of the research is
realized, and that the research is carried out in a man-
ner that is ethically justiÔ¨Åable. The OECD guidelines of
2009135 provide that:

the operators of
the Human Biobanks and Genetic
Research Databases (HBGRD) should have a clearly articu-
lated policy that is communicated to participants relating
to the commercialisation of its own resources, research re-
sults derived from those resources, and/or commercial
products, if any, that may arise from research using its
resources.

Further, the ‚Äòoperators of the HBGRD136 should have a
clear policy in regards to IP rights, which should ad-
dress the rights, if any, of the Human Biobanks and
Genetic Research Databases, researchers and partici-
pants‚Äô. The reasonable expectation of the public to-
wards the use of their samples in medical research
requires biobanks not only to have a clear-cut policy on
industrial involvement and research participation, but
also in securing beneÔ¨Åts to the community that contrib-
uted the samples for such uses. This also requires atten-
tion to the principles of altruism and good clinical
practices
evolved from the Helsinki
Declaration and the Belmont Report.137 While endeav-
ouring to promote ‚ÄòBig Data‚Äô research, biobanks must
also ensure that signiÔ¨Åcant community beneÔ¨Åts evolve
from such research. This requirement stems from a
number of international instruments like UNESCO‚Äôs
International Declaration on Human Genetic Data138
and the HUGO Ethics Committee Statement on BeneÔ¨Åt
Sharing.139 Such directional changes would need a re-
Ô¨Ånement in the role of the National Ethics Committees

132 The author‚Äôs own research reveals certain patterns involved in these re-

search contracts.

133 A non-exclusive licensing means the licensor remains free to exploit the
same intellectual property and to allow any number of other licensees to
also exploit the same intellectual property. This gives a bit of Ô¨Çexibility
for biobankers but it is not free from defects, and often experience shows
that pharmaceutical companies and other industrial partners are reluc-
tant to deal in non-exclusive practices as it may affect drug development.
Hence the appropriate strategy is still being explored in regard to licens-
ing for biobanks. See Duncan Curley, Intellectual Property Licenses and

and Boards of Ethics within biobank governance
structures.

This leads to a second issue‚Äîthe proprietary nature
of rights over samples. It is an essential concern due to
lack of clarity in the legal frameworks governing use of
human biological materials, particularly for research
purposes. Although the law tends to deÔ¨Åne that human
body parts are res extra commercium140 ‚Äòas such‚Äô, it
fails to provide guidance on the use of tissue or cells
used in research. Thus there is a strange vacuum as to
the concept of ‚Äòownership‚Äô over such biological mate-
rials. Social policy requires that such matters need to be
structured within law in securing the balance and
avoiding a legal gap.141

Finally, IP rights often go unaddressed in guidelines
relating to health research. The result of this is that often
research gets entangled in a web of complex misconcep-
tions. There is the robust need, at least at the EU level,
for clarity in this respect. This would undoubtedly help
to deÔ¨Åne the parameters for governance of big genetic
databases. A ‚ÄòPublic Consultation on Health Databases
and Biobanks‚Äô was announced by the World Medical
Association in 2015, which drew attention to the prob-
lem of the use of biological materials in biomedical re-
search.142 The consultation sought to give a special
consideration to the possible exploitation of IP rights. It
also considered protection of ownership over materials,
rights and privileges before collecting and sharing the bi-
ological materials.143 Some of the responses published
online have sought to highlight the problems which this
article presents. For instance, one of the comments
points out that one cannot always speak of ‚Äòownership‚Äô
about human material, because there is a risk of confu-
sion between intellectual property rights and the other
prerogatives on the resources.144 It has also been sug-
gested that there exists an ambiguity as to the consider-
ations
to be taken into account with regard to
intellectual property rights which required explicit meas-
ures in that regard.145 Another opinion called to limit
the ‚ÄòProtections for ownership of materials, rights and

privileges . . . before collecting and sharing the material
and data‚Äô, (as provided in the consultation146) to indige-
nous groups only.147 It has also been suggested with re-
gard to future uses of samples that researchers should
describe all further use and data access in terms that are
reasonable at the point of data collection and ensure that
data are not used in any manner incompatible with
those purposes. Keeping the board consent would thus
ensure that research using samples from biobanks are
not hampered; however, it has been suggested that an in-
dependent ethics committee should also be consulted to
determine whether a new consent is necessary for sec-
ondary uses of such samples.148 This also calls for moni-
toring of research activities going on within biobanks by
an ethics committee which was yet another suggestion
towards biobank-related research.149 These stakeholder
concerns have Ô¨Ånally been given shape in the form of the
‚ÄòWMA Declaration of Taipei on Ethical Considerations
regarding Health Databases and Biobanks, 2016‚Äô,150 This
document is regarded as a complementary tool to the
Helsinki Declaration as modiÔ¨Åed in 2013, taking into ac-
count the need for the medical profession to have guid-
ance about how to ethically approach the rapidly
growing agendas of health databases and biobanks.151
The Declaration of Taipei calls for special considerations
to the possible exploitation of
intellectual property.
Accordingly it requires that protection for ownership of
materials, rights and privileges must be considered and
contractually deÔ¨Åned before collecting and sharing the
material. Intellectual property issues should be addressed
in a policy that covers the rights of all stakeholders and
should be communicated in a transparent manner.152

Thus there still remains much to be conÔ¨Ågured at
least as far as IP rights in the Ô¨Åeld of biotechnology are
concerned. There exists ample scope to use patent laws
to address some of these concerns. The EPC does not
expressly require applicants to submit evidence of pre-
vious informed consent of the donor of the cells or a
beneÔ¨Åt-sharing agreement, nor has its approach been
broad enough to include an assessment of consent in

the light of the public ordre and morality clause to give
strength to biotechnological
inventions. However,
some national patent laws contain provisions outlining
a consent requirement for samples used in research
leading to the patent, eg in Denmark.153 A wider appli-
cation of this could offer some solace in this regard,
and help to offer a constructive approach to biotech in-

vention considerations.154 This may help biobanking in
alleviating the current concerns of the public towards
research and thus increase the propensity towards in-
creased industrial and research partnership in the larger
community interest, which is the cornerstone of bio-
banking and the very basis for the creation of such ‚ÄòBig
Data‚Äô.

154 International Declaration on Human Genetic Data 2003‚ÄîSpecial status

(a) Human genetic data have a special status because: (i) they can be pre-
dictive of genetic predispositions concerning individuals; (ii) they may

have a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the family, including offspring, extending
over generations, and in some instances on the whole group to which the
person concerned belongs; (iii) they may contain information the signiÔ¨Å-
cance of which is not necessarily known at the time of the collection of
the biological samples; (iv) they may have cultural signiÔ¨Åcance for per-
sons or groups. (b) Due consideration should be given to the sensitivity
of human genetic data and an appropriate level of protection for these
data and biological samples should be established.
