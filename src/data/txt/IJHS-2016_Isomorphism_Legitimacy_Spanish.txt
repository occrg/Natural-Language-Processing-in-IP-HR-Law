Isomorphism and legitimacy in Spanish contract archaeology: the 
free-fall of an institutional model and the caveat of change

ABSTRACT
Societies today face multiple challenges stemming from the conflict between 
‘market efficiency’ and ‘social welfare’ that are, in turn, the result of neoliberal 
policies  affecting  institutional  legitimacy.  Complex  institutional  logics 
associated with organisational responses are part of the early sociological 
debate about how organisations cope with established institutionalism in 
order  to  maintain  legitimacy  and  survive.  By  employing  an  institutional 
framework and historical event sequencing approach, we aim to understand 
whether normative pressures can be understood to exert an influence of 
embeddedness and change. The paper analyses the emergence of Spanish 
contract archaeology after the 1990s. This new organisational pattern in the 
field of archaeology was a complex institutionalised process that gave rise 
to a new labour market. The economic crisis starting in 2008 has impacted 
this sector severely, to the extent that it is, at the time of writing, on the 
brink of extinction.

Isomorphism in the history of contract archaeology
Institutionalisation is defined as the process of repeated actions over time (Scott 1987). The processes 
of institutionalisation are created neither randomly nor in a vacuum. This means that ‘institutionalism’ 
refers to a particular vision of the world, which is presented as the natural order. As Foucault (1980) 
has argued, power-knowledge mechanisms entail social embeddedness. Serving to reproduce and 
strengthen institutional authority, isomorphic processes are generally defined as practices of homog-
enisation incorporated by organisations and individuals seeking legitimacy in a prescriptive system 
of cultural meanings (DiMaggio and Powell 1983, 1991; Binder 2007).

However, neither isomorphism nor institutionalism are static. In fact, much of what occurs in social 
life is the result of actions whose intentions were other (Knights and Morgan 1991). This statement 
aims to emphasise the micro-implications of certain macro-conceptions, which often involve new 
challenges that prompt changes within institutionalism. A pivotal moment in the transformation of 
the archaeological sector in Spain was the introduction of the developer-funder paradigm known as 
the ‘polluter pays’ principle in the Valletta Convention (Council of Europe 1992). This expression has 
particular significance: it introduces the capitalist logic of having ‘to pay’ for heritage protection as

a palliative in the context of the threats of development and modernisation. By contrast, prior to the 
introduction of this regulation all archaeological activity had been related to scientific research whose 
value came from outside the market.

The Valetta Convention permeated European archaeological legislation and practice in the late 
twentieth century (Willems 2007a; Kristiansen 2009). Through the establishment of laws, standards 
and sanctions, it involved a process of coercive isomorphism, emphasising the role of the state as the 
creator and enhancer of the rules as well as the holder of power (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Scott 
1995; Ashworth, Boyne, and Delbridge 2009).

The existence of a common legal framework led to a new, complex and rationalised heritage man-
agement system in which the archaeological sector became an important driver of urban regeneration 
and land-use planning (Aitchison 2009; Hamilakis 2015). This new logic led to a more technical (and 
as Smith [1993] criticised, a subsequently less theoretical) orientation of archaeological work, driving 
the insertion of archaeology into processes of commodification. In turn, this trend generated a set 
of professional activities and organisational forms that were generally different to and divorced from 
research-focused or social objectives. Nonetheless, most archaeology managers and professionals still 
came from academia, and as such shared a common desire to record and to preserve.

The adaptation of archaeological heritage management to the logic of commodification introduced 
by states thus resulted in the transformation of the sector. The introduction of complex isomorphic 
structures pursuing legal, market and social legitimacy favoured different and sometimes paradoxical 
frameworks for organisations. By employing an institutional framework and historical event sequenc-
ing approach, this article aims to understand how organisations cope with uncertainty in order to retain 
legitimacy and to survive. That is, how do organisational responses contribute to the maintenance of 
institutionalist ideology? Do organisational responses affect established institutionalism? Also, to what 
extent do paradoxical frameworks for organisations could be the mediating mechanism of institutional 
change? (Scott 1987; Rao 1998; Oliver 1991; Seo and Creed 2002; Greenwood et al. 2011).

The institutional frame provides a context of homogeneity, structure, culture and output in which 
organisations have to deal with different rationalisms, uncertainties and constraints (DiMaggio and 
Powell 1983). Historical-event sequencing can reveal underlying patterns of cultural transforma-
tion, defining the cultural symbols and material practices that comprise embeddedness and change 
(Thornton, Jones, and Kury 2005). The transformation of the Spanish archaeological sector in the 
late twentieth century provides the empirical base for this enquiry. In this particular case, coercive 
isomorphism led to other institutional changes, new isomorphic processes and significant sectoral 
modifications. In turn, these changes resulted in the rapid growth and then the similarly severe decline 
of contract archaeology.

Facing the absence of either reliable records or previous studies addressing the evolution of the 
Spanish archaeological business and quantifying its impact, we have aimed to fill this scientific gap. 
Several research projects supported a longitudinal study between 2006 and 2015, allowing us to map 
the nascent and subsequently thriving archaeological business, characterising the situation of the 
archaeological profession as well as the effects of the crisis in this activity.

In order to provide a holistic context for interpretation, our methodology included a mixture of 
qualitative and quantitative methodologies (Denzin 1978), exploring different sources and imple-
menting different techniques (see methodological details in Table 1).

The qualitative research we conducted involved 107 interviews with archaeology students, academ-
ics, civil servants, workers, ex-workers, CEOs, self-employed individuals, and former CEOs to provide 
a comprehensive and longitudinal insight into this context. Participation was voluntary and interview 
procedures ensured anonymity and confidentiality. Nonetheless, each of our requests for an interview 
was accepted, and nobody declined to participate. To guide the research we used a semi-structured 
interview template. However, we did not adhere to it strictly, and interviewees were encouraged to 
talk freely about the topics that seemed important to them. These interviews ranged from roughly 
50 to 100 min. They were digitally recorded with the interviewee’s permission, and transcriptions 
were made of all relevant fragments. Our questions related to the economic, legal, and institutional 

294

environment for archaeology in Spain. Subsequently, we analysed our interviews through open coding. 
The initial codes were then merged with similar or overlapping ones into more meaningful analytical 
categories (Pettigrew 1997). Through these interviews, our aim was to identify key themes regarding 
the development of contract archaeology, the long-term economic crisis and its implications for the 
future of archaeological activity. The interview accounts were used to construct an outline of the crit-
ical events in the course of archaeological activity in Spain. Finally, we carried out three case study 
analyses of successful firms in 2014, in the context of economic crisis. We chose these case studies 
from a list of potential firms created on the basis of the authors’ experiences with the archaeology 
industry. This list was submitted to a panel of academics and practitioners of archaeology. Based on 
their responses, we selected three firms which had been successful despite the crisis. We contacted 
these firms to explain our research project, and all agreed to participate. First-hand data were drawn 
from in-depth interviews, specific documents and publicly available literature on the archaeological 
companies. Despite the adverse economic context, a set of questions about diversification services 
and customer reorientation was introduced.

Quantitative data were derived from two surveys with archaeological firms. First, we mapped the 
archaeological industry in Spain, creating a census of firms. We collected information from Spanish 
public institutions related to archaeological activity, professional associations linked to archaeology, 
companies’ databases and, finally, searching for information through public advertisements, websites 
and blogs. The result was a record of 273 companies in 2009. Although this record may not contain 
the exact total number of firms, it is nonetheless a very close approximation. Second, we designed 
a questionnaire with several interrelated sections, covering different aspects of firm demographics, 
services, dynamics and evolution. This questionnaire was validated through a pilot sample of archae-
ological firms. Finally, it was administered to 212 firms, which represented a response rate of 76.7%. 
The remaining firms either refused to participate after several telephone calls or could not be contacted. 
The census of Spanish archaeological firms was updated in 2013 in order to conduct a second-wave 
survey. This involved 106 firms out of the 158 organisations that existed at the time, representing a 
decrease of 42% in a 4-year period.

From heaven to hell: Spanish contract archaeology
Principles of complexity: institutionalism in Spanish archaeology management
Historically,  Spanish  archaeology  professionals  were  trained  in  an  academic  environment,  which 
provided them with a research-institutionalised logic. However, this began to change in the 1990s 
when national legislation adopted the principles of the Valetta Convention, which were disseminated 
through national and regional regulations. Spain’s regional political-administrative system is somewhat 
idiosyncratic, comprising 17 autonomous communities with corresponding normative and managerial 
powers. The archaeological management guidelines assumed by each of the 17 regions reflected terri-
torial variations in legislation, systems and practices in line with international and national standards. 
In general terms, the implementation of the regional models continued the process of commodification 
of archaeological activity based on different political versions of the same underlying economic system.
Alongside ongoing political transformations in Spain during this period, the construction sector 
thrived. National economic prosperity resulted in an unprecedented volume of building activity, rep-
resenting an average of 7.7% of Spanish GDP between 1980 to 1990, with continuous growth during 
the 2000s. A peak was reached in 2006, when construction represented more than 12% of GDP. For 
the sake of comparison, the impact of the building sector on the GDP of the UK was 6.0% in 2000, 
increasing slightly to 7.1% in 2008.

This  market  situation  led  to  high  demand  for  archaeological  management  work.  A  new  class 
emerged of archaeologists (employees, self-employed workers, freelancers and companies) that were 
keen to work and earn money by preserving Spain’s cultural heritage. Their task was supervised by 
public administrations prior to the start of environmental, urban and land development projects, and 

 

  295

promoted mostly by the construction industry through private funding, resulting in a prosperous 
‘archaeology business’ (Díaz-del-Río 2000).

The rapid pace at which this situation developed led to the creation of normative requirements 
related to professional practices, work processes and ethical codes in an entirely new and uncertain 
context (Willems 2009). Meanwhile, archaeologists in academia throughout Europe generally adopted 
a somewhat distant and critical position, disregarding the technical paradigm, discrediting the work 
of professional archaeologists and rejecting the possibility that cultural heritage might strengthen the 
economic and social environment (e.g. Winter 2013). As a result, a number of professional associations 
emerged in order to implement certain protocols and codes of practice. This gave rise to a corporate 
logic – that is, a normative isomorphic process – which shaped professional legitimacy under the 
influence of institutionalism (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Scott 1987). However, the archaeologists 
involved were university-trained, and correspondingly became preoccupied with heritage preservation 
and recording, as well as the creation of research-oriented perspectives in their professional practice.
Thus, the ‘archaeology business’, commonly known as ‘commercial or contract archaeology’, evolved 
within  a  complex  institutional  framework,  which  has  been  described  as  ‘neoliberal  corporatism’ 
(Alonso González and Macías Vázquez 2014). In the search for legitimacy in a highly regulated but 
rather vaguely planned liberal context, archaeologists and archaeological companies had to reconcile 
ambidextrous logics, comprising the norms of heritage protection, scientific orientation, and profes-
sional practices, while at the same time pursuing market efficiency and competitiveness (Vicent García 
1991; Criado Boado 1996; Willems 2007b; Harding 2009; Zorzin 2015a). This set of factors did not 
preclude the creation of numerous archaeological companies and a large archaeology labour market 
in Spain. Survey data show that 273 archaeological companies were established between 1985 and 
2009, with more than 2500 jobs linked to these organisations. Huge demand for their services and 
numerous job opportunities enhanced the nascent institutionalism in this growing industry.

Market rationality: the height of contract archaeology in Spain (1990–2008)
As a new and dynamic business activity, companies in this field had to make quick decisions in a con-
text of multiple institutional logics and uncertain sectoral conditions. The ambiguity of this context 
encouraged a mimetic isomorphic rationality: a process whereby organisations modelled themselves 
on other organisations. In doing so, these companies imitated the behaviours of those peers whom 
they perceived as successful. The aim was to reduce risks and to enhance legitimacy, efficiency and the 
likelihood of survival (Cyert and March 1963; Oliver 1991; Lieberman and Asaba 2006).

The data illustrate the following isomorphic practices. To begin with, Spanish archaeological com-
panies established a homogeneous business model, oriented towards the construction industry, which 
was the main client for almost 85% of these companies. Activities such as conducting controls, mon-
itoring development work, and undertaking emergency excavations constituted the core business of 
80% of the companies surveyed in 2009.

The process of acquiescence prevailed within the structure of the companies, and resulted in a 
dynamic, flexible and strongly localised managerial pattern. Most companies surveyed in 2009 were 
small in size (86% of firms had ten or fewer employees, with an average of 5.75 workers) and had a 
prominent part-time employee base (51% of employees occupied temporary positions), which fluc-
tuated depending on workload and project approval. Regional regulation associated with high local 
demand promoted a restricted organisational scope (73% of firms worked in the region in which they 
were located). However, if a particular company was overwhelmed by demand for equipment, human 
or economic resources, dynamic organisational structures facilitated collaboration (83% of the sample 
had collaborated under both formal and informal agreements to perform joint actions or undertake 
major projects; only 37 companies had not engaged in partnerships). Archaeological companies can 
be considered very interactive, especially when compared to other similar growing businesses, such 
as those providing engineering services or technical advice activities (63% of these companies collab-
orated, according to data from the Spanish Statistical Office in 2009).

296 

  E. PaRga-DanS ET al.

These isomorphic practices anchored a structure of the archaeology consulting business expressly 
designed to satisfy construction logics and concerns, namely fast delivery and strong focus on costs, 
all in order to achieve legitimacy and survival.

The Spanish contract archaeology sector grew exponentially from the 1990s to 2008. According 

to one interviewee:

Things are going well, private construction is providing us excellent revenues in cities and rural areas […]. Our 
priorities in terms of funding are in construction and public works. We are working on many things, generating 
a huge workload. Archaeologists were encouraged to create companies and to work with specialists to carry out 
development plans. It is a great time, demand is at its highest and the profession is beginning to consolidate. 
(Entrepreneur, in 2005).

Thus, an active business model suited to the instability of the construction industry operated suc-
cessfully  during  this  period,  while  fulfilling  legal  requirements.  Through  normative  and  market 
adjustments,  an  isomorphic  contract  archaeology  came  to  reflect  the  prevailing  institutionalism, 
strengthening its values, symbols and legitimacy.

Market rationality: the collapse of contract archaeology in Spain (2009–2013)
The dynamics of Spanish contract archaeology, therefore, evolved significantly during the building 
boom. However, the financial crisis after 2007 and the recession that resulted from it (real estate 
market crisis, industrial slump, banking crisis, cuts in public budgets) had devastating effects on the 
construction industry and, subsequently, in archaeological activity. This shocked the established and 
promising isomorphic business field.

Following the onset of the crisis, the Spanish government adopted measures to revitalise the econ-
omy based on massive investment in major infrastructure projects to deal with the impact of the 
crisis. These initial measures attenuated the immediate effects of the crisis in the archaeology sector. 
However, eventually, public funding for archaeological research and heritage management plummeted, 
especially after the implementation of government cuts. The failure to stimulate the economy put a 
sudden end to most of the sources of funding that had enabled the sector to remain active. As several 
of our interviewees argued:

The building boom catapulted us to success, and the recession has sunk us. In the last 10 years we excavated 
beyond our means. The bubble of archaeology provoked by construction was so excessive. The good times are 
over; now there are barely any urban excavations. Going back to the levels of activity we previously registered is 
unthinkable. We should have realised then that what was going on was not real. (Archaeologist 2011)
Archaeology is starting to feel the effects of the crisis, a downturn in private projects, but there’s still public 
investment. We’re at the point where everyone has to find their place; there’s work, but things are still uncertain. 
I think the market is too fragmented with way too many companies; but maybe not all of them will survive. The 
real crisis will come in 2013, when the Administration will no longer fund public works. In 2014 we will probably 
be out of work. (Archaeologist 2012)

The data corroborate the following sequence of events. Our second set of surveys revealed that 42% 
of the companies in operation in 2009 had disappeared by 2013, 66% of the previously recorded 
work positions had vanished, and most remaining jobs were precarious (52% of remaining contracts 
were temporary and low-paid). Despite the strong impact of the crisis, the archaeological isomorphic 
business model did not change during this period. In fact, 95% of the companies operating in 2013 
continued to target the construction industry through fieldwork activities such as assessment, record-
ing, excavation, and surveying. This core business accounted for the survival of 85% of the sample and 
76% of firms continued to operate in regional markets. However, 78% of those surveyed stated that 
their economic performance had worsened in comparison with previous years.

There was some diversification related to services and customer reorientation, identified through 
three cases of businesses that were successful despite the crisis. These companies offered specialised 
information technology (IT) activities such as satellite-based surveying, geographical IT, remote sens-
ing archaeology, or 3D technologies applied to archaeology. They worked both in heritage outreach, 

 

  297

including educational activities and museum projects, and for archaeological research. Despite this 
diversification, most surviving companies and professionals maintained their isomorphic business 
orientation, concentrating on the scant remaining demand from the construction sector. Meanwhile, 
the vast majority of Spanish archaeological workers were forced to abandon archaeology altogether.
When the business environment becomes highly fragmented as a result of competition and unpre-
dictable institutional pressure, companies implement concealment or decoupling strategies. These 
strategies  enable  symbolic  acceptance  of  institutional  norms,  rules  and  requirements,  alongside 
implementation of detachment tactics to benefit the organisation, especially in terms of maximising 
efficiency and hiding non-conformity behind a facade of acquiescence (Oliver 1991). The impact of 
decoupling practices on the Spanish archaeological sector was qualitative. As one interviewee affirmed:

From the ministries to the municipalities there began a process of speculation based on the transformation of 
rural into urban terrain. Everything was done officially, but we all knew what lay behind it. It was amazing how 
much revenue could be generated through an excavation. When a developer called us, we usually budgeted very 
high or we shared the project with colleagues. We were overwhelmed! Money just showered down on us. The 
number of students enrolled in history was outrageous. Soon afterwards came the tragedy; [there were] depres-
sions and some suicides among developers. The local archaeology companies are all closed. The feeling of guilt is 
enormous – we were conniving with the model but we did nothing because there was a slice of cake for everyone. 
Archaeologists were the obstacle for construction, and we forgot society. Our work should be oriented to society. 
So far we have dedicated ourselves to making money and delivering reports to the administration, and society 
has been marginalized, ‘poor builder, they say’, but we have not given anything to society! (Archaeologist 2015)

Historical  event  sequencing  reveals  a  disintegrating  Spanish  archaeological  sector.  This  triggered 
change in the sector’s self-perception, and revealed the inconsistencies of earlier logics. The disintegra-
tion of the Spanish archaeological sector necessitates a critical, open and thoughtful review that moves 
beyond discourses of efficiency and questions the fundamentals of taken-for-granted institutionalism.

A discussion of faith and money
From a theoretical perspective, the case study of Spanish contract archaeology challenges dominant 
institutional models. While coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphic processes minimise disso-
nance, the crisis context highlights other challenges that go beyond efficiency and functionality. The 
evolution of the Spanish commercial archaeology sector shows that uncontroversial models based 
on so-called ‘efficiency’ and devoid of critical thinking can have corrosive effects. In this sense, the 
sector is an example of decoupled or ambidextrous coexisting logics (Meyer and Rowan 1977), which 
have introduced dissociation between compliance with the regulatory mandate of heritage protection 
adopted by companies and everyday dynamic business practices (i.e. earning money to survive). In 
other words:

The (archaeological) report is made to justify the work (development), [and] is a piece of paper that supports 
the (administrative/political) decision of making the construction project viable. Depending on who requests 
or for what purpose the request is made, the (archaeological) report is made to fit the request. (Politician 2015)

In the case discussed in this paper, the mediation of a capitalist logic among different political versions 
of the same isomorphic model favoured a common understanding grounded on efficiency and homo-
geneous technical skills. This was the case despite the social and public aim of heritage protection and 
outreach for which the legal process had supposedly held (Meyer and Rowan 1977).

The excessive reliance on market dynamics embedded in an institutional model resulted in a frame-
work in which the principal value of archaeology became the release of land. That is, archaeology 
became a legal obstacle that construction companies had to overcome to increase the value of land.
The decline of Spanish contract archaeology has prompted debate on the performance of the pre-
vious institutional model. This model was depoliticized and emphasised the importance of efficiency 
and technical knowledge, which both constituted engines of economic development, and possessed 
collective potential to respond to present and future challenges. Companies’ necessity to survive 
and reduce uncertainty favoured a focus on encouraging ‘efficient’ business performance, instead of 
extending heritage management activities.

298 

  E. PaRga-DanS ET al.

While this discussion can be extended beyond the Spanish context and the field of archaeology, 
it represents a discursive narrative concerning the contemporary challenges suggesting new forms 
of action, institutionalism and legitimacy. There exists a large body of scholarship questioning the 
capitalist economic model and highlighting its perverse effects on heritage management (e.g. Smith 
2000; Hamilakis and Duke 2007; Gnecco and Lippert 2015; Zorzin 2015b). Another strand of scholarly 
literature provides information on the archaeological sector and analyses its evolution in different 
countries after the crisis hit (e.g. Aitchison 2009; Everill 2009; Schlanger and Aitchison 2010; Cleary 
et al. 2014).

These studies suggest that debate on a sustainable future for archaeology should consider institu-
tional transformations, political and economic analysis, and multiple and complex questions. Such 
questions include: Can archaeology form part of an increasingly ‘unproductive’ model? Can archae-
ology contribute to processes of institutional change, and how? Can archaeology, as a practice gov-
erned by public institutions, increase public awareness of heritage? Can archaeology ultimately lay 
the foundations for an alternative social and economic model?

In an evolutionary context, we can distinguish between those who postulate a radical break from 
earlier values and those who hypothesise a dialectical view of reality as a key principle. In the context 
of archaeological heritage management provided by the Malta agreements, the dialectical option 
implies that it is possible to develop archaeology within the structural paradigm in which it emerged 
(e.g. Kristiansen 2009). For example, Everill (2009) explains that in the UK, the ‘polluter pays’ prin-
ciple could be maintained and archaeological operations could become independent of developers 
through the creation of a national (in the sense of public) archaeological service, funded by a tax 
paid by developers. In the Spanish case, some of the surviving companies are beginning to diversify 
their services towards the provision of public archaeology and heritage outreach. However, this kind 
of archaeology does not approach the economic profitability of preventive archaeology, and is not 
therefore able to incorporate the labour previously employed in management archaeology, especially 
within an unchanged institutional framework.

However, the breakaway option implies the necessity for a paradigm shift in order to implement 
other archaeological practices and heritage policies (e.g. Gnecco and Lippert 2015; Hamilakis 2015). 
In line with this, Zorzin (2015a, 137) argues that ‘in order to produce an ethical outcome within a new 
praxis for archaeology, archaeologists might have to work outside the influences of capitalist logic’.

It will be complex to formulate future scenarios in a context of uncertainty, liquidity, volatility, 
global recession, globalisation and faith-money fetishes. It seems likely that the current institutional 
isomorphism will persist in the near future. Thus, in our view, a long-term alternative should involve 
the archaeological heritage management with the social/public aim of encouraging archaeological 
heritage protection and outreach, based on collective action and a repoliticization of the sector. This 
perspective would include multiple logics involving civil, technical, academic, political, and local 
voices, among others.

The institutional approach adopted here allows for the deconstruction of current isomorphic logics, 
revealing a logic of efficient failure. New arrangements for dealing with disagreement and dysfunctional 
logics could begin to lay the groundwork required to re-establish public and community heritage man-
agement legitimacy, rooted in other types of efficiency, more ambitious and inclusive than earlier ones.
Future research should focus on critical thinking, overcoming the criteria of efficiency and devising 
scenarios for a truly social archaeological practice, including all actors involved, not only archaeology 
professionals. It should be extended to other contexts, such as Latin America, where preventive archae-
ology is beginning to develop. Discussions about future scenarios for archaeology should encompass 
other contexts, sectors and agents in order to provide a more concrete and multivocal explanation of 
the factors, processes and dynamics involved.

Conclusions
New organisational and institutional forms are historically constituted (Rao 1998). This paper has 
discussed institutional isomorphism and the logics under which Spanish contract archaeology evolved. 
We have described the institutional pressures that directly influenced the propagation and adoption 
of certain heritage management practices and the establishment of a homogeneous organisational 
field. This case offers empirical insights into the classical institutional debate on how institutions are 
socially constructed, reproduced and transformed (Scott 1987). While isomorphism and legitimacy 
provide a rational framework to understand and interpret historical events, the cumulative effect of 
such events in path-dependent processes reveals the metatheory underlying the pattern of change.

The commodification of archaeological knowledge as a professional practice and its increasingly 
technical orientation triggered a complex isomorphic process balancing a variety of institutionalised 
logics. This process pointed towards ways in which archaeological companies cope with uncertainty in 
order to maintain legitimacy as well as reproduce institutionalism. These included, firstly the existence 
of a common legislative framework in the late 1990s reinforced the importance of the protection and 
management of heritage for firms (coercive isomorphism). Secondly, ethical and professional codes and 
research orientations based on academic training and university education legitimised the relevance 
of knowledge specialisation (normative isomorphism). Third, the practice of commercial archaeology 
was biased by liberal market dynamics, embodying a new business model (mimetic isomorphism) 
in which archaeology companies promoted urban regeneration activities (museums, parks, historic 
properties, etc.) and rural developments (roads, wind farms, irrigation systems, etc.).

However, in a context of institutional complexity and multiple competing frameworks, organisa-
tions produce contradictory and/or hybrid responses in order to achieve legitimacy in an ambiguous 
system of cultural meaning (Oliver 1991; Greenwood et al. 2011). This explains how organisational 
responses affect the established institutionalism, generating reflexivity and change.

The post-2007 economic crisis evinced the exhaustion of a heritage management model that was 
being symbolically maintained. The inability of commercial archaeology to operate in a turbulent envi-
ronment questioned the dominant efficiency criteria in a liberal business context. The sudden decline 
in archaeological workloads, the massive decrease in employment, and numerous firm bankruptcies, 
challenged the legitimacy of contemporary business discourses of ‘efficiency’ as a vital strategy for 
successful modern economies. From an institutional perspective, these discourses include the logic of 
failure associated with insufficient efficiency to maintain flexible, functional and knowledge-intensive 
isomorphic organisations. In those cases, the systematic reproduction of useable knowledge and the 
accumulation of sophisticated cognitive resources could constitute mechanisms to achieve smart 
companies (Kogut and Zander 1992; Adler 2001).

The usefulness of smart functional intelligence as a pillar of organisational order and individual 
certainty cannot be questioned. However, this isomorphic logic entails significant risks for the desired 
efficient organisational performance. The risk is that firms become functionally stupid (Alvesson and 
Spicer 2012), accepting existing institutional decisions and organisational structures and avoiding 
questions related to the firm’s or the system’s values and goals, reducing possibilities for analytical, 
reflexive and critical thinking.
