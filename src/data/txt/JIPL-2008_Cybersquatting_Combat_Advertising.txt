Cybersquatters are at it again. After fading into the
background during the early years of
this decade,
brand-exploiting domain name proﬁteers have returned
in force, using paid advertising services to turn their
domain name portfolios into proﬁt centres. Unfortu-

the antiquated procedures of
the Uniform Domain
Name Dispute Resolution Process (UDRP) prevent
brand owners from reclaiming cybersquatters’ port-

an updated anti-cybersquatting
regime. After examining the phenomenon of cyber-
squatting in its current form, this paper examines the
ﬂaws in existing laws and procedures, suggests some
improvements in the UDRP and national
laws, then
proposes the development of a regime that harnesses the
efﬁciency of the UDRP with the enforcement muscle of
national IP laws. The paper will then demonstrate how
the updated regime could help to ﬁll the gaps that have

Key issues
† The early cybersquatters selected their victims
individually, weighing up the likely value of a
domain name that might, on account of its com-
mercial utility or strategic signiﬁcance, be sold to
a rightful owner at a premium. Various regimes
were put in place to address this activity.

† While the mechanisms for combating cybers-
quatting remain in place,
there has been a
quantum leap in the volume of sites appro-
priated for gain and a paradigm shift in the tech-
niques for their mass acquisition.

† This article reviews the modern phenomenon of
cybersquatting, takes a critical view of existing
legal devices for remedying it, and makes some
practical suggestions for the alleviation of the
current domain name registration crisis.

abusive registration of a domain name in violation of
rights in trade marks and service marks’.2 This implies
the registrant’s use of the domain name to proﬁt at the
expense of the exploited marks.

For the purposes of this article, a brief review of the
Internet Domain Name System (DNS) and the process
of domain name registration are necessary. The DNS
provides ‘an alpha-numeric mnemonic device that can
be mapped on to an [internet protocol, or IP] address
to enable users to “surf the Web” more easily than if
they had to remember the details of each IP address
they wanted to visit’.3 The domain names that comprise
the DNS are hierarchical structures comprised of a

and one or more second-level domains (SLD) ‘consist-
ing of a mnemonic string of letters that pinpoints the
location on the Internet’.4
corresponding website’s
When a user types the domain name into a web
browser, the browser connects with a name server—an
intermediary computer which matches the domain
name with its corresponding IP address so that the
browser can call up the appropriate website.5 Thus, a
user looking for the website of Microsoft Corporation
need only remember the domain name microsoft.com,
rather than the IP address at which Microsoft’s website
is located.

TLDs are classiﬁed as either generic or country-
speciﬁc. gTLDs are equally available to the entire global
internet community and are operated by non-govern-
mental or quasi-governmental entities like the Inter-
national Corporation for Assigned Names
and
Numbers (ICANN).6 Country-speciﬁc TLDs (ccTLD)
are governed by the nation-state to which they corre-
spond.7 At present, there are 20 active gTLDs and
approximately 240 ccTLDs.8 ICANN is constantly con-
sidering proposals for new gTLDs, and has developed a
speciﬁc strategy to guide the continuing introduction
of new gTLDs into the DNS.9

Generic TLDs can be further divided into ‘spon-
sored’ and ‘unsponsored’ categories. ‘[A]n unsponsored
gTLD operates under the general TLD policies estab-
lished by the global
internet community directly
through the ICANN process and there are few restric-
tions on how the name is used. A sponsored gTLD, in
contrast, is a specialized gTLD that has an organization
representing the narrower community that

are sponsored.11 Of
the eight unsponsored gTLDs,
four (.com, .info, .net, and .org) are completely unre-
stricted, meaning anyone can register any SLD within
them.12

Cybersquatting occurs in all TLDs but is most preva-
lent in the four unrestricted, unsponsored gTLDs,13
which are the subject of this article. References below
to gTLDs refer speciﬁcally to the four unrestricted,
unsponsored gTLDs, although some of
the points
raised are applicable, mutatis mutandis, to other gTLDs
and even many ccTLD’s.

The mechanics and vulnerabilities
of domain name registration
The DNS, developed long before the notion of a com-
mercial internet had found its way into the popular
consciousness,14 was not designed to be secure from
fraud or to protect IP rights.15 Any person wishing to
register a domain name in an unsponsored gTLD may
do so by contracting with a registrar accredited to
assign domain names in the relevant TLD.16 More than
800 registrars are eligible to assign domain names in
the unsponsored gTLDs.17 Accredited registrars often
subcontract with independent resellers who, while not
themselves accredited, funnel large numbers of regis-
trations through their sponsoring accredited registrar,18
providing a would-be registrant with literally thousands
of potential registrars from which to choose.

Domain names that are not currently registered are
available on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis to any regis-
trant willing to pay a registration fee.19 Increasingly,
registrars also offer bulk registration tools that allow a

registrant to obtain hundreds of unregistered domain
names with just a few clicks of a mouse.20 Currently
registered domain names can sometimes be purchased
in the domain name aftermarket. Several online ser-
vices exist to facilitate the buying and selling of domain
names.21

Whether a person claims an unregistered domain
name or purchases the registration from an existing
registrant, the new registrant must provide the registrar
with certain basic data which is entered into the public
WHOIS database.22 The information required for
gTLDs includes the registrant’s name, physical address,
contact phone number, and an email address.23 The
information in the WHOIS database can be searched
with respect
to a particular domain name or IP
address, but it cannot be searched with respect to a
particular registrant. Thus, one cannot search for all
domain names registered to John Smith at 1234 Main
Street, Dallas, Texas. This functionality—colloquially a
‘Reverse WHOIS’ search—is currently available only
from private web research services who maintain their
own proprietary databases of WHOIS data.24

While in theory, the WHOIS database could provide
signiﬁcant information about domain name registrants,
registrars rarely if ever verify a registrant’s WHOIS
data, although they are supposed to.25 Registrants can
also purchase a privacy protection service offered by
most registrars.26 When a registrant purchases this
service, the registrar replaces the registrant’s informa-
tion in the WHOIS database with its own contact
information.27 The registrar keeps the registrant’s in-
formation on ﬁle, but generally will reveal
it only
under subpoena or if
threatened with legal action
arising from the content on the website to which the
registrant’s domain name resolves.28 The combination
of unveriﬁed information and widespread use of
the WHOIS
privacy protection limits the value of

database, particularly when dealing with domain name
registrants who do not wish to be identiﬁed.

The evolution of cybersquatting
Cybersquatting developed in response to the oppor-
tunities presented by the insecurity of
the domain
name registration process. The original cybersquatters
realized that, by registering strategic domain names,
they could effectively monopolize a brand’s online pre-
sence. These cybersquatters had a simple business
model. They registered domain names, then offered to
sell them to the mark owners at inﬂated prices.29 If the
brand owner balked at the asking price, the cybersquat-
ter threatened to sell the domain names to the mark
owners’ competitors.30 Using this strategy, cybersquat-
ting pioneers like Dennis Toeppen acquired hundreds
of mark-based domain names and demanded exorbi-
tant sums from companies like Panavision, Delta Air-
lines, Neiman Marcus, Eddie Bauer, Lufthansa, British
Airways, Crate and Barrel, Ramada, British Telecom-
munications, Marks & Spencer, Virgin, J. Sainsbury,
and Ladbroke.31

In the late 1990s, national courts began to rule that
cybersquatters were infringing the marks on which
their domain names were based.32 Shortly thereafter,
ICANN implemented the UDRP to make it possible for
mark owners
to reclaim squatted domain names
without the expense and inconvenience of litigation.33
Together,
the UDRP and anti-cybersquatting court
decisions removed much of the incentive for cyber-
squatters, who became less active once they could no
longer exploit their domain names through resale.34

A new way to monetize domain names arose when
companies like Google and Yahoo introduced large-
scale pay-per-click advertising services. These services
enable website owners to proﬁt from advertisements

displayed on a portion of any website. Participants reg-
ister one or more web pages or domain names with the
service and designate the portion of the relevant pages
they would like populated with advertisements. The
service ‘“will then scan the text of [the] website and
populate or ﬁll the [designated portion] with advertise-
ments it deems relevant to the content on that site.”
Every time a computer user clicks on an ad (transport-
ing the user to the advertiser’s site), the advertiser pays
a fee to [the service], which shares the fee with the
Web site on which the ad appeared’.35

Cybersquatters quickly realized that domain names
with signiﬁcant amounts of trafﬁc could generate sub-
stantial advertising revenue with these programmes,
and that a signiﬁcant number of internet users seek the
ofﬁcial websites of companies or products by typing
the relevant company or brand names directly into
their web browser’s address window.36 Sensing an
opportunity, cybersquatters began to register countless
mark-based domain names that users were likely to
stumble across while searching for a particular brand
or company, and to ﬁll the corresponding websites
with paid advertisements. The targeted domain names
included misspellings, homophones, products
for
which the mark owner did not register a domain name,
and combinations of marks with generic terms or other
marks.37

This new approach sparked a signiﬁcant change in

the cybersquatting industry.38

The amount of money available for cybersquatters
with heavily trafficked domain names is substantial.

Further,

cybersquatting

advertising-based

offers
important advantages over resale-based cybersquatting.
First, advertising-based cybersquatters can hide their
domain name portfolios and their identities to avoid
enforcement actions. The original cybersquatters had to
reveal which domain names they controlled in order to
coerce brand owners to buy those domain names back.
They also had to reveal vital information about their
identities in order to arrange payment, which made it
easier for brand owners to leverage the power of the
UDRP and national IP laws against them. Advertising-
based cybersquatters, by contrast, earn money by
keeping their advertising sites online. The better they
hide themselves, the less likely they are to lose domain
names to enforcement actions, and the more money
they make. To this end, advertising cybersquatters regu-
larly provide domain name registrars with false per-
sonal
if not
impossible to identify them via the WHOIS database.40
Cybersquatters also take advantage of privacy protec-
tion services to insert the registrar between themselves
and the brand owners whose marks they exploit.41

information that makes

it difﬁcult

Secondly,

advertising-based cybersquatting

gives
cybersquatters more control over the proﬁtability of
their domain names. An advertising cybersquatter’s
proﬁt is largely tied to the number of domain names
he controls and the amount of trafﬁc to his domain
names. Cybersquatters can use tools like spam and
search engine manipulation techniques
link-
farming to increase trafﬁc to their sites and increase
proﬁts.42

The bulk registration tools available from many
registrars also make it easy for cybersquatters to amass
large portfolios of domain names at a low cost. The art
of bulk domain name registration has become increas-
ingly sophisticated. For example, today’s squatters have

domain names by returning domain names that do not
generate trafﬁc. The strategy, known as ‘tasting’ or
‘kiting’, exploits the fact
that every domain name
registered in a gTLD can be un-registered with a full
refund within 5 days of the initial registration.43 Cyber-
squatters use this policy to sample the trafﬁc on large
numbers of domain names, keeping only those with
proﬁtable levels of trafﬁc.44

The growing popularity of speculative domain name
registration prompted the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) to predict that the DNS could
soon become ‘a mostly speculative market’.45 Trade
mark-based domain names comprise a signiﬁcant
portion of
this speculation: a recent WIPO report
notes that the number of cybersquatting disputes ﬁled
with its UDRP service increased by 25% from 2005 to
2006 alone.46 For example, a recent search of
the
domain name aftermarket portal offered by the
company Sedo revealed more than 3,000 active .com
domain names containing the mark IPHONE.47 The
list included domain names like attiphone.com and
ipodiphone.com, both of which were ﬁlled with paid
advertising at
the time of writing. One company
reported that a further 150 domain names exploit
different
such as
iphoen.com and i0hone.com.48 Searches on the Sedo
website for active domain names containing other
marks,
including ZUNE, SONY, GOOGLE, HSBC,
IPOD, BLACKBERRY, and BBC yield similar results.
Indeed, one recent survey concluded that the world’s
500 biggest companies have all fallen victim to these
new squatters.49

and lower cases, the numbers 0 to 9, the full stop and
the hyphen’.51 Recently, pressure has mounted for a
global technological solution to introduce global IDNs
using non-ASCII characters, such as those used in the
Arabic and Cyrillic alphabets, as well as the ideograms
and symbols that comprise many other languages.52
ICANN is currently moving ahead with testing to
insert IDN characters into the Internet’s TLD root
structure, an experiment that could open the DNS to
all manner of new characters and symbols.53

The addition of hundreds of new symbols to the
DNS will signiﬁcantly increase the potential for cyber-
squatters. Not only can every cybersquatting trick that
works with ASCII be adapted to work with non-
Roman alphabets, but the similarities between symbols
in different alphabets will increase the prevalence and
effectiveness of homographic attacks, such as when a
cybersquatter registers the domain name microsoft.com
using the Cyrillic symbol
‘r’
in place of the ASCII
symbol that shares its shape.54

Whether

terms of

involvement

in cybersquatting
becomes widespread will partially depend on how
ICANN handles such cases. Cybersquatting activities
probably violate
ICANN Registrar
Accreditation Agreement, including those regarding the
submission of accurate registrant information and the
duty not to engage in fraudulent activities.58 Such vio-
lations would entitle ICANN to terminate a registrar’s
accreditation.59 If ICANN responds to cybersquatting
by terminating registrar accreditations, registrars may
be sufﬁciently deterred. ICANN’s failure to take strong
action could pave the way for a signiﬁcant amount of
registrar cybersquatting.

The threat to brand owners
Cybersquatting is undesirable from a brand protection
standpoint. ‘A company’s reputation can suffer if a dis-
reputable third party owns a part of its online identity.
And that can lead to lost sales.’60 However, modern
cybersquatting creates two more speciﬁc problems that
brand owners should be concerned about.

First, modern cybersquatters actively divert custom
away from the owners whose brands they target. As the
advertising model of cybersquatting has evolved, so has
the art of populating these domain names with advert-
isements likely to induce clicks. Dozens of companies
now provide ‘parking’ services to ﬁll pages with ‘contex-
tual advertisements’ that relate to the company, industry,
or product referenced in the domain name.61 Thus, a
domain name exploiting the mark of a particular
company will often resolve to a page featuring advertise-
ments for that company’s competitors. For example, as
of this writing, the domain name royal-bank-of-sco-
tland.com resolves to a parked page featuring advertise-
ments for Royal Bank of Scotland competitors like Bank

of Scotland/Halifax and Nationwide.62 A user who stum-
bles across this page looking for the Royal Bank of Scot-
land website could easily be induced to click through to
the Halifax or Nationwide website, either because he is
confused and believes that the Royal Bank of Scotland
promotes or endorses those banks, or because he cannot
be bothered to make further efforts to ﬁnd the Royal
Bank of Scotland’s website. In either case, the Royal Bank
of Scotland loses potential business.

Secondly, cybersquatters make it harder for new
marks or brand names to develop distinctive online
presences. Since existing brands are now rather picked
over, the introduction of a new brand or mark has
become the cybersquatting equivalent of discovering a
new vein of gold in a mine. Cybersquatters pay close
attention to rumours about forthcoming brands or
products, often seeking to ‘jump’ a new mark by regis-
tering hundreds or thousands of related domain names
before the mark has been announced.63 Squatters who
ﬂood the DNS with domain names targeting a new
brand will increase confusion among consumers who
are not yet familiar with the brand, making it more dif-
ﬁcult for that brand to gain a high proﬁle presence in
the online marketplace. New brands are also more sus-
ceptible to the diversionary effects of contextual adver-
tising because consumers may be more familiar with
existing, competing brands whose advertisements may
appear on the parked page.

Finally, registrar involvement in cybersquatting, if it
should occur, is particularly troubling for IP owners
because of registrars’ unparalleled access to the DNS.
These companies have the technology and expertise to
scrape the internet for available domain names and reg-
ister those domain names automatically and in bulk,
while their gatekeeper function enables them to claim
expired domain names which they can then hold or sell
at auction rather than placing them back in the pool of
domain names available for anyone to register.64 This
can drive up the cost
to IP owners of reclaiming
domain names that infringe their marks.65 Registrars
can also place pay-per-click advertisements on websites
at domain names that have been registered by third

parties but are not currently in use, thereby proﬁting

Flaws in the current anti-cybersquatting
regime
Anti-cybersquatting tools have failed to keep squatters
in check since, being developed to deal with the orig-
inal cybersquatters, they are ill-equipped to deal with
modern cybersquatting.

The two-track concept of the current
anti-cybersquatting regime
The current anti-cybersquatting regime is a two-track
system. Brand owners can use the UDRP to reclaim
infringing domain names from cybersquatters efﬁciently
and inexpensively, but not to pursue any other reme-
dies.67 Stronger remedies, including awards of damages
and injunctive relief, are available through litigation in
national courts that apply more stringent standards
than the UDRP.68 These two tracks operate independ-
ently, leaving brand owners to decide on a case-by-case
basis which is the more appropriate.

This bifurcation is deliberate. When cybersquatting
ﬁrst arose in the 1990s, there was debate about how
best to apply traditional principles of IP law to the
DNS.69 While there was little dispute that domain
names fell within the purview of IP laws, there was dis-
agreement about how those laws should apply within
the DNS.70

The DNS is not naturally suited to trade mark law,
which is rooted ﬁrmly in the concept of limited exclu-
sivity. ‘Traditionally, a trade mark, even if well known,
does not give its owner exclusive rights over every poss-
ible commercial use and in every country. The sectoral
and territorial principle backs up the idea that trade
mark protection best achieves its purpose by limiting
the reservation of rights in a name to the type of goods
and location where those goods are sold.’71 This system

Limited exclusivity does not work with domain
names because gTLDs are exclusive and unlimited by
political boundaries or the category of goods offered.72
Whoever owns mcdonalds.com owns
the exclusive
rights to that domain name across the entire globe,
regardless of
the legitimate claims of other mark
owners operating in different jurisdictions and offering
different goods and services to those of the domain
name registrant.73 In the mid-to-late 1990s courts
wrestling with this situation, and with other questions
such as whether domain name registrars should be
liable for their registrants’ infringing domain names,74
produced a series of decisions that were largely sym-
pathetic to brand owners, but not particularly clear
with respect to the legal standards that applied in
cybersquatting cases from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.75
While the difﬁculties in applying trade mark law to
the DNS were universally recognized, there was also
broad agreement that brand owners needed an efﬁcient
and reliable tool to stop cybersquatters whose bad faith
registrations were far removed from the legitimate dis-
agreements of competing mark owners.76 In 1999,
WIPO proposed the development of a global domain
name dispute resolution process to help brand owners
from cybersquatters,77
reclaim domain
suggesting that the process be limited to cases of bad
faith registration so as to avoid cases involving compet-
ing claims by legitimate rights holders.78 In the interest
of ensuring that the administrative process would not
swallow relevant national IP laws in the DNS, WIPO
also proposed that remedies be limited to the cancella-
tion or transfer of domain name registrations, and that
recourse to national courts applying national laws be
explicitly permitted.79 The substance of WIPO’s propo-
sal became reality when the ICANN formally enacted
the UDRP on 24 October 1999.80

The two-track anti-cybersquatting regime
in action
Today the anti-cybersquatting regime still follows the
two-track approach. All registrars accredited to register
domain names in gTLDs must, as a part of
their
accreditation, incorporate the UDRP into their regis-
tration agreements. Thus, every gTLD domain name
registrant is contractually bound to its terms and can
be forced to relinquish a domain name registration if a
UDRP panel determines the domain name was regis-
tered in bad faith.81 Many jurisdictions have also
updated their statutory or common law IP laws to pro-
hibit cybersquatting. Brand owners who wish to recover
damages or obtain injunctive relief against a cybersquat-
ter can petition national courts for such relief in accord-
ance with the terms of the applicable laws.

A brand owner who chooses to go the UDRP route
initiates the proceeding by ﬁling a complaint with an
ICANN-approved dispute resolution service provider.82
There are currently three such providers: WIPO, the
National Arbitration Forum, and the Asian Domain
Name Dispute Resolution Centre.83 A complaint must
identify the domain name(s) at issue, as well as any
information available to the complainant about the
registrant’s identity, and specify whether it wants the
case heard by a single-member panel or a three-
member panel.84 The complainant must also pay a
ﬁling fee.85

Each of the three service providers sets its own fee
schedule. WIPO charges set rates for disputes involving
up to 10 domain names, with a minimum cost of
US$1,500 (for one to ﬁve domain names and a single-
member panel) and a maximum cost of US$4,000 (for
six to 10 domain names and a three-member panel).86
The fee for disputes involving more than 10 domain
names must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.87
The National Arbitration Forum charges set rates for
disputes involving up to 15 domain names, with a
minimum cost of US$1,300 (for one or two domain

names and a single-member panel) and a maximum of
US$5,000 (for 11 to 15 domain names and a three-
member panel).88 The fee for disputes involving more
than 15 domain names must be negotiated on a case-
by-case basis.89 The Asian Domain Name Dispute Res-
olution Centre does not require larger cases to be nego-
tiated individually. Each of its three ofﬁces charges a
minimum of US$1,000 (for one or two domain names
and a single member panel) and a maximum of
US$7,000 (for 10 or more domain names and a three-
member panel).90

In some cases,

Once a complaint is ﬁled, the domain name regis-
trant has 20 days to respond,91 failing which the panel
considers the case solely on the complainant’s sub-
mission.92
the panel may request
additional ﬁlings.93 Once the panel has received all
necessary submissions, it reviews the papers and issues
its order. The panel has three options: it can conﬁrm
the registrant’s right to the domain name; it can order
the registration cancelled; or it can order the domain
name transferred to the complainant.94

To prevail in a UDRP proceeding, the
complainant bears the burden of demonstrating
that the domain name is identical or confusingly
similar to its mark, that the registrant has no
legitimate interest in the domain name and the
domain name has been registered and is being
used in bad faith.

‘neither requires panelists to apply the law of any par-
ticular nation, nor sets forth any choice of law guide-
lines for panelists’.96 Instead,
its implementing rules
instruct panelists to determine whether the complai-
nant has carried its burden by applying the UDRP’s
language and rules, as well as ‘any rules and principles
of law that [the panel] deems applicable’.97

The UDRP offers guidance as to bad faith and afﬁr-
mative defences. The policy notes that bad faith exists if
the registrant (i) acquired the domain name primarily
to sell or rent the domain name at a proﬁt to the mark
owner or the mark owner’s competitor; (ii) acquired
the domain name as part of a pattern of conduct in
which the registrant acquires domain names in order to
prevent mark owners from reﬂecting marks in their
domain names; (iii) acquired the domain name primar-
ily to disrupt the business of a competitor; or (iv)
sought to attract internet users to the domain name for
commercial gain by creating a likelihood of confusion
between the domain name and mark owner.98 These
scenarios are examples, and are not exhaustive.99

As to afﬁrmative defenses, the policy also provides
non-exhaustive examples of ways in which the regis-
trant can demonstrate legitimate rights in the domain
name. These are that the registrant (i) used or prepared
to use the domain name in connection with a bona
ﬁde offering of goods or services before becoming
aware of the UDRP complaint; (ii) was commonly
known by the domain name even if he has no trade
mark rights in the domain name or (iii) is otherwise
making legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the
domain name without intending to proﬁt from mis-
leading consumers or tarnishing the mark at issue.100

Finally, the UDRP allows any party to remove the
dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction at any point
between ﬁling the complaint and ten business days after
the panel renders its decision.101 If neither party removes
the case to a national court by then, the registrar will
carry out the instructions contained in the order.102

If one party removes the action to a national court,
the UDRP ceases to operate and the relevant national
jurisdictions have adopted
law controls. Different

Trade mark laws are consistently called into service
despite the early concerns about trade mark principles
and the DNS. This paper focuses on the USA and the
UK which, according to a survey, are the ﬁrst and
second most active cybersquatting jurisdictions.103 In
England and Wales, the Court of Appeal conﬁrmed in
British Telecommunications Plc v One in a Million Ltd
[1999] WLR 903 that cybersquatters can be held civilly
liable for common law passing off and for trade mark
infringement under Section 10(3) of the Trade Marks
Act 1994.104 Courts in the UK continue to cite One in
a Million as the controlling cybersquatting decision.105
Under One in a Million, a brand owner’s civil claim
for passing off and trade mark infringement against a
cybersquatter will prevail if the brand owner can estab-
lish the elements of each of those claims. For passing
off,
the claimant must demonstrate that (i) it has
amassed good will in its mark; (ii) the defendant’s use
of the mark-based domain names is likely to confuse
‘ordinary, sensible members of the public’ into believ-
ing that the claimant is responsible for the domain
names and the content on the websites to which they
resolve; and (iii) the defendant’s activities are likely to
cause, or have caused, actual damage to the claimant
through loss of custom or erosion of reputation.106 A
brand owner’s claim for
trade mark infringement
against a cybersquatter will prevail either if, through
the identity or similarity of the mark and the domain
name and of any respective services provided under
them, a likelihood of confusion arises107 or if the brand
owner demonstrates that (i) its mark has a reputation
in the UK; (ii) the defendant’s domain name is identi-
cal or similar to the claimant’s mark; and (iii) the
defendant’s use of the domain name without due cause
takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental
to the
distinctive character or repute of the mark.108

The USA has gone further, enacting the
Anti-Cybersquatting and Consumer Protection Act
(ACPA) to bring cybersquatters within the scope of
the Lanham Act—the American trade mark statute.

The USA has gone further, enacting the Anti-Cyber-
squatting and Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) to
bring cybersquatters within the scope of the Lanham
Act—the American trade mark statute.109 The ACPA
imposes liability for infringement on a domain name
registrant if the claimant demonstrates that the regis-
trant (i) has a bad faith intent to proﬁt from the clai-
mant’s mark and (ii) registers, trafﬁcks in or uses a
domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to
that mark.110 ACPA actions are limited to marks that
were distinctive or famous at the time the domain
name was registered.111 If the claimant’s mark was
famous at the time the domain name was registered, he
can also prevail

While the UDRP’s standards bear some conceptual
similarity to those of the relevant national laws in both
the UK and the USA, it applies a less precise standard
than relevant national laws when it comes to determin-
ing whether a domain name registrant infringes a mark
holder’s rights. The invitation for panelists to apply
whatever principles of law they deem relevant grants

with respect to bad faith and afﬁrmative defences lose
sight of the need ‘to effectively balance the right of
registrants and complainants in novel or close cases’
and signiﬁcantly narrow the defence of fair use for
registrants whose critical or expressive use of a domain
name may tarnish the mark upon which the domain
name is based.114 On this issue, UDRP panels have

the domain name registrants were not using the
domain names to generate proﬁt.115

As WIPO anticipated when it proposed the two-
track approach, the disharmony between the UDRP
standard and national IP laws has prompted most
courts to disregard panel decisions when trying cyber-
squatting actions.116 In the UK, no court has yet cited
a panel decision in any reported cybersquatting case. In
the USA, courts have consistently refused to afford any
deference to ‘the outcome of the ICANN administrative
proceedings’ when considering infringement claims
based on cybersquatting activities.117 It
is now an
established tenet of US federal law that courts ‘give the
decision of the WIPO panelist no deference’ in decid-
ing a subsequent lawsuit regarding infringing use of a
domain name.118 This refusal to take note of UDRP
decisions is premised in substantial part on the fact
that ‘a UDRP decision is susceptible of being grounded
on principles foreign or hostile to American law’.119

Why the current regime cannot cope
with modern cybersquatting
The two-track approach worked well against the orig-
inal
cybersquatters, who monetized their domain
names by selling them to the highest bidder. Once the
UDRP empowered brand owners to reclaim infringing
domain names without paying cybersquatters for them,
squatters’ domain names lost their value and cyber-
squatting lost much of its incentive. The disconnect
between the UDRP and national statutes was not prob-
lematic in those years because the efﬁciency and
deterrence
the UDRP ensured the
additional muscle of trade mark statutes was rarely
necessary. Brand owners could handle most cybersquat-
ting cases administratively, turning to litigation only
occasionally when a particularly egregious case arose.

afforded by

Today, the two-track approach no longer works. The
UDRP is no deterrent because it is procedurally out-
dated and does not reduce the value of domain names
that generate proﬁt from advertising rather than resale.

IP laws remain available to brand

owners,

litigation is too expensive and inefﬁcient to

The UDRP is no deterrent
The UDRP is no longer an effective deterrent against
cybersquatters for three reasons. First,
its reach is
limited to those domain names a brand owner has
identiﬁed using public records. That was feasible when
cybersquatters held relatively small numbers of high-
proﬁle domain names and publicized their portfolios
to generate sales, but is impotent against cybersquatters
who control thousands of domain names spread across
different registrars, hidden behind false WHOIS data
and privacy protection. Since even a moderately soph-
isticated cybersquatter can make it virtually impossible
for a brand owner to discover more than a fraction of
his portfolio using publicly available resources, cyber-
squatters are reasonably conﬁdent that a UDRP action
will never reach more than a fraction of their holdings.
The threat of losing a small handful of domain names
is no deterrent to modern cybersquatters, for whom
such minor
losses are merely the cost of doing
business.

Second, the UDRP lacks any punitive mechanism
to dissuade cybersquatters from continuing to operate.
Penalties were not needed to deter
the original
cybersquatters because the UDRP alone prevented
them from monetizing their domain names. That is
not the case with modern cybersquatters, who mone-
tize their domain names by keeping them online. No
matter how many domain names a cybersquatter loses
in a UDRP action, he can still replace them with others
that can also be ﬁlled with paid advertising. The UDRP
can make cybersquatting less proﬁtable, but cannot
make it unproﬁtable. So long as the potential for proﬁt
remains, cybersquatters will have an incentive to keep
operating.

Finally, what little deterrent potential the UDRP may
have is further undermined by the fact that the two
service providers, WIPO and the
most popular
National Arbitration Forum,120
require brand
owners to negotiate the price of every dispute involving
more than 10 or 15 domain names, respectively. This
adds unnecessary delay and expense to any action that
could take even a moderate bite out of a cybersquatter’s
portfolio, potentially dissuading brand owners from
pursuing UDRP enforcement actions.

still

Traditional litigation is no solution
Traditional litigation using national IP laws offers the
discovery tools and punitive teeth lacking from the
UDRP, but litigation has never been a macro-level sol-
ution to cybersquatting. The UDRP was introduced
precisely because traditional litigation was not efﬁcient
or reliable enough to keep up with the fast growth of
the cybersquatting industry of the 1990s.121 Although
the two-track anti-cybersquatting regime was developed
with the expectation that traditional
litigation would
remain important, implicit in that expectation was the
belief that cases requiring litigation would be the excep-
tion rather than the rule. The evolution of modern
cybersquatting has turned that expectation on its head:
cases in which the UDRP provides an effective remedy
against a cybersquatter are now the rare exception. This
leaves brand owners in the position they occupied
before the UDRP was enacted.

Meanwhile,

the evolution of

the cybersquatting
litigation an even less
industry has made traditional
efﬁcient tool to combat cybersquatting than before.
Cybersquatters have become more sophisticated and
better at hiding themselves, making it more difﬁcult for
brand owners to discover serious offenders, and the
volume of their operations has grown so rapidly that
even the most well-resourced and litigious brand
owners can barely scratch the surface.122 Smaller brand
owners whose budgets cannot accommodate expensive
large-scale litigation programmes have no real hope of
using litigation to get ahead of modern cybersquatters.
In light of these realities,
it is even less realistic to
litigation to combat cybersquatting
expect traditional
today than it was in the 1990s.

Designing an updated anti-
cybersquatting regime
An effective response to modern cybersquatting must
harness both the efﬁciency of an administrative process
like the UDRP and the deterrent power of national IP
laws. To that end, this article proposes amending both
the UDRP and relevant national statutes to allow them
to work together. Any effort to develop a cooperative
anti-cybersquatting regime would need to overcome
signiﬁcant hurdles. First, the UDRP would have to be
procedurally updated to enable it to cope with modern
cybersquatters.

sufﬁciently in line with the relevant national IP laws to
justify giving it weight in national courts. Third, rel-
evant statutes would need to be updated to formalize
the relevance of UDRP proceedings to trade mark
infringement suits. Finally, penalties for cybersquatting
infringement would need to be made sufﬁciently harsh
to remove the incentive for cybersquatters to continue
operating. These hurdles are substantial, but all are sur-
mountable.

Updating the UDRP’s procedures
The ﬁrst step in the development of an anti-cyber-
squatting regime that harnesses the collective power of
the UDRP and national laws is to update the UDRP’s
antiquated procedures
to facilitate the recovery of
domain names in the volumes that modern cybersquat-
ters register them.

Limited discovery
Cybersquatters have succeeded in exploiting the vulner-
abilities in the DNS to obscure their identities and the
extent of their portfolios. The ﬁrst step in updating the
UDRP process must be to make it easier for brand
owners to defeat these tactics. The ideal solution would
be for registrars to verify all registrant WHOIS data
and for a Reverse WHOIS search capability to be
deployed across the entire WHOIS database. Since
neither of those solutions currently exists, this article
suggests a more limited solution: registrars should be
required to assist in UDRP proceedings by supplying
lists of domain names with common ownership upon
request from a brand owner who has initiated a UDRP
proceeding.

Consider the following hypothetical scenario. Acme
Corporation owns the mark ACME. In the course of its
routine brand monitoring, Acme discovers paid contex-
tual advertising sites at the domain names acmeamerica.
com, acmeproducts.com, acmeonline.com, and acmme.
com. A query of the WHOIS database reveals that the
registrants for the four domain names have different
names, addresses, and telephone numbers, but the same
administrative contact email address, and that all four
domain names are registered through the same registrar.

Under the current UDRP, Acme could use the UDRP
to reclaim the four domain names it had discovered,
along with any related domain names it discovered
through investigation of publicly available data, such as
other domain names hosted at or near the IP addresses
of those four domain names, or other domain names

using the same name servers as those four domain
names.123 If it had the resources, Acme could also hire a
private service to conduct a Reverse WHOIS search that
might reveal some additional domain names registered
using the same contact email address, depending on the
extent and accuracy of the service’s proprietary database.
Ultimately, however, Acme could only initiate a UDRP
action with respect to the domain names it identiﬁed
from the public WHOIS data, even if the registrant also
controlled hundreds of other Acme-based domain names
that Acme could not discover through public records.

Acme should be permitted to use the UDRP to
request that the registrars of the domain names it
has identified reveal which other domain names
are registered to the same person.

Instead of

Acme should be permitted to use the UDRP to request
that the registrars of the domain names it has identiﬁed
reveal which other domain names are registered to the
same person.
initiating an enforcement
action limited to the domain names it has already dis-
covered, Acme could ﬁle an initial complaint identify-
ing the domain names it had already discovered, and
incorporating any of
the registrant’s other domain
names that infringe its marks. The dispute resolution
provider with whom the complaint
is ﬁled would
provide the complaint to the registrars of the domain
names Acme identiﬁed, requesting production of a log
containing all of the domain names registered by the
same entity or person who registered the identiﬁed
domain names.

Implementing this limited form of discovery should
not be difﬁcult. Accredited registrars are already
obliged to incorporate the UDRP into their terms of
service, and are contractually prohibited from permit-
ting the sale or transfer of a domain name that is the
subject of a pending UDRP action.124 These rules could
be amended to oblige registrars to produce a list of
domain names held by the same registrant in response
to a UDRP complaint.

Certain safeguards would be needed, to protect the
personal information of innocent parties, including the
accused cybersquatter, should Acme’s claim be dismissed
for lack of merit. For example, it may be advisable for
registrars to search for common ownership based only
on commonalities in the two pieces of data supplied by

the registrant that are most likely to be valid: adminis-
trative email addresses (which are likely to be valid
because registrars use them to communicate with regis-
trants
and
methods of payment (such as the same credit card or
PayPal account). While such a restriction may limit the
scope of domain names revealed to Acme, the highly
unreliable nature of the other, unveriﬁed, data could
create an unacceptable risk of false positives. Restricting
the search to email addresses and methods of payment
would also minimize the burden this new obligation
would place on registrars.

Registrars should not be required to reveal the exact
payment details associated with the relevant domain
names. A mere certiﬁcation from the registrar that the
same account was used to pay for the domain names
should be sufﬁcient for the complainant to identify rel-
evant domain names without revealing the personal
ﬁnancial data of the registrant. A registrant wishing to
dispute his registration of the domain names identiﬁed
in the registrar’s log could present evidence to that
effect in his response to the Complaint. Once the regis-
trars produce their respective lists of domain names
with identical email contact or payment information,
Acme could amend its complaint to include all of those
domain names it believed it was entitled to recover
from the registrant.

This solution, making it easier for brand owners to
discover the extent of cybersquatters’ domain name port-
folios, will also assist in combatting bulk domain name
registrations that occur in a single transaction with a
single source of payment and a single set of registrant
WHOIS data. Nevertheless,
this solution would not
reveal domain names the alleged cybersquatter registers
through other registrars unknown to Acme. That limit-
ation is probably inescapable, because it would not be
practical for every brand owner to demand that every
registrar conduct a search of its records in every UDRP
proceeding. Development of a Reverse WHOIS search
capability for the entire WHOIS database could provide
a middle-ground to help close this gap by giving the
brand owner a chance to identify some additional
domain names with email
that
matched those of other squatted domain names.

contact addresses

Revise service provider fee structures
An efﬁcient tool to identify high-volume infringing
domain names will only solve half of
the UDRP’s

inadequacies. Service providers
current procedural
should also update their fee structures to accommodate
bulk UDRP actions that reﬂect the structure of modern
cybersquatting. WIPO and the National Arbitration
Forum should amend their tiered fee structures to
provide set fees for actions regarding up to 500 domain
names. The idea of tiered fees is fundamentally sound,
and should be retained, but the break points should be
signiﬁcantly adjusted to facilitate the kinds of bulk
actions required by modern cybersquatting.

Ideally, both providers would follow the Asian
Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre’s policy of
establishing a maximum fee for all disputes involving
more than a certain number of domain names. This
would make the cost of enforcement proceedings easier
to calculate for brand owners, and would improve the
UDRP’s efﬁciency by eliminating the need to negotiate
the fee for every sizeable cybersquatting case.

Introduce a choice of law provision
Increased efﬁciency of the UDRP will only make the
anti-cybersquatting regime more effective if it can be
harnessed as a deterrent. Cybersquatters who lose por-
tions of their portfolios to UDRP actions but suffer no
other penalty have every incentive to rebuild their port-
folios with new domain names. Deterrence can only be
achieved if the UDRP and national IP laws apply com-
patible standards, which they currently do not.125 The
UDRP’s open-ended standards allow panels to consider
any principle of law and apply it however the panel
deems relevant. Even those portions of the UDRP that
deal with bad faith and afﬁrmative defences offer little
guidance because they are explicitly non-exhaustive.
This cannot be squared with the limited and more rig-
orous standards set forth in national laws like the Trade
Marks Act 1994 and the ACPA.

Nor is this incompatibility purely formalistic. The
UDRP’s permissive standards have manifested them-
selves in haphazard decisions that vary from one panel
to the next. ‘While some panelists apply the law of the
country in which the parties are domiciled, others
either merely apply the law of the panelists’ country of
origin or, more commonly, refuse to consider any
nation state’s law in favor of resolving the dispute
exclusively in accordance with the UDRP rules’.126
Observers have noted that these open-ended standards
have
also resulted in proceedings being skewed
in favour of brand owners when panels give the

While this may be the predictable result of

the
decision to compromise rigour in favour of expediency
in the UDRP, it ensures that the UDRP will remain
incompatible with the standards set by national IP
laws. If the two are to work together against cyber-
squatters, the disconnect must be eliminated. The only
way to accomplish that is to realign the UDRP with
national
the UDRP should be
amended to include a voluntary choice of law clause
that complainants can use to ensure that a UDRP
panel evaluates its complaint using the substantive law
of a particular jurisdiction.

laws. To that end,

In the example discussed above, under the current
regime Acme would submit its Final Complaint to
reclaim the domain names it believed were registered
in bad faith, and the panel would render a decision
based on its interpretation of the UDRP rules and
whatever legal principles the panel deemed relevant. If
the panel upheld Acme’s claim with respect to all the
disputed names and Acme later decided to litigate
against the cybersquatter in a court of competent juris-
diction, the UDRP decision would be irrelevant to the
subsequent court case.

Under this article’s proposal, Acme could ask the
UDRP panel to apply the law of the jurisdiction where
it would bring the subsequent litigation. Thus, if the
cybersquatter were located in the UK, Acme could
instruct the panel to determine whether its claim has
merit under the UK laws of trade mark infringement
and passing off. If the cybersquatter were located in the
USA, Acme could instruct
to apply the
ACPA. This would eliminate the substantive disconnect
between the UDRP and national IP laws, and should
also help to create more consistency in domain name
dispute resolutions within different jurisdictions.

the panel

The choice of law option has a potential disadvan-
tage for brand owners. While the more stringent stan-
dards imposed by national IP laws should make UDRP
panel decisions more consistent,
they could also
make it more difﬁcult for a brand owner to reclaim a
registrant’s domain names. If that additional risk were
to dissuade brand owners from using the choice of law
option, the updated anti-cybersquatting regime might
be little more effective than the current
regime.
However, the overtly bad faith nature of cybersquatting
should keep that risk fairly low. A brand owner with a

meritorious claim against a cybersquatter with a port-
folio of dozens or hundreds of
infringing domain
names
should have little difﬁculty prevailing even
under the more rigorous standard of a national IP law.
Nevertheless, the choice of law option should not be
mandatory. Some brand owners will be satisﬁed to
reclaim domain names from cybersquatters without
pursuing additional legal action. In those cases, there
would be no reason to force the brand owner to choose
a particular national
law to govern the dispute. The
brand owner could continue to beneﬁt from less rigor-
ous standards in exchange for accepting the limited
remedy of reclaiming the domain names.

Updating national statutes
Incorporating a choice of law clause into the UDRP
could help resolve
inconsistencies
between panel decisions and national IP laws, but it
will not guarantee that courts applying those laws will
give panel decisions more weight than at present. Nor
will
it ensure that courts that do give deference to
UDRP decisions will do so in a consistent manner. To
maximize the beneﬁts of bringing the UDRP in line
with national legal standards, relevant national statutes
should be amended to formalize the signiﬁcance of
UDRP panel decisions in subsequent litigation.

The goal of such amendments should be to stream-
line the litigation process such that brand owners can
pursue legal and equitable remedies against cybersquat-
ters with less investment of time, money, and energy
than at present. The most appropriate
statutory
amendments would vary from jurisdiction to jurisdic-
tion, but a useful strategy could be to provide that, if a
UDRP panel applies the law of the relevant jurisdiction,
a panel decision in the brand owner’s favour constitutes
prima facie evidence of
infringement that creates a
rebuttable presumption in favour of the brand owner
in subsequent litigation arising from the same set of
facts as the UDRP complaint.

if Acme were to prevail

Returning to the hypothetical case of Acme: under
the proposal,
in its UDRP
action with the panel applying the law of the UK, it
could ﬁle an infringement suit against the cybersquatter
in the appropriate national court,
incorporating the
panel’s order into its complaint as prima facie evidence
that the defendant infringed its rights under UK law.
The burden would then shift to the defendant to chal-
lenge the panel’s factual ﬁndings or application of that
law. This would spare Acme from having to build a

new case against the domain name registrant to main-
tain its claims in the national court.

Where the defendant did challenge the factual or
legal validity of the panel decision, each jurisdiction
would have to decide the standard of review to be
applied. In most cases, it should be sufﬁcient for the
standard of review to be that applied in other cases
involving judicial review of an administrative decision.
If the court were to ﬁnd the panel decision factually or
legally erroneous, the burden would return the claim-
ant to present original evidence sufﬁcient to justify
its claims.

resources

This proposal would still require Acme to invest sig-
niﬁcant
in domain name litigation but,
unless the court were to ﬁnd the panel decision invalid,
the amount of time and money required for an in-
fringement suit would be substantially reduced. The
more streamlined process should spur more brand
owners to pursue litigation to obtain damages and
injunctive relief against serious cybersquatters. The
increased risk of
should in turn
provide the deterrent missing from the current anti-
cybersquatting regime.

serious penalties

The proposed system is likely to become more efﬁ-
cient as time passes. Even if courts initially reject panel
decisions as factually or legally ﬂawed, those decisions
will contain guidance for future panels applying the
laws of that jurisdiction. Those panels will therefore be
more likely to decide cases in a manner that
the
national courts will accept.

Formalizing penalties
Finally, it may be worth considering statutory remedies
for cybersquatting cases. The USA has long used statu-
tory penalties to reduce the burden on successful
claimants in IP cases, and provides for such penalties
in cybersquatting cases. In the USA, a claimant who
proves infringement in a cybersquatting case is entitled
to recover the sum total of the defendant’s proﬁts, the
claimant’s damages and the costs of the legal action128
or statutory damages of US$1,000 to US$100,000 per
domain name, with the appropriate amount left to the
judge’s discretion.129

Widespread adoption of statutory damages schemes
in cybersquatting cases could beneﬁt brand owners by
further reducing the ﬁnancial uncertainty of litigation.
More importantly, the availability of substantial guar-
anteed damages to prevailing brand owners could sub-
stantially aid the cause of deterrence. If cybersquatters
know that they are more likely to be hauled into court

as a result of their actions, and that a successful claim-
ant has access to statutory damages that could cause
them severe ﬁnancial pain,
combination of
increased threat and consequence could help to drive
down the number of cybersquatters and limit the oper-
ations of the remaining ones.

the

Towards an updated regime
The proposed updates to the UDRP and national IP
laws will not stop cybersquatting, but
they should
provide brand owners with the tools they need to
reclaim the upper hand in the battle for control of
domain names that exploit marks for commercial gain.
If brand owners can leverage the UDRP’s contractual
power over registrars to unearth signiﬁcant portions of
a cybersquatter’s domain name portfolio, it will be sig-
niﬁcantly more difﬁcult for squatters to accumulate and
maintain hidden collections of domain names. While
cybersquatters will still be able to obscure their holdings
by spreading them over multiple registrars, brand
owners need only discover a small handful of domain
names registered through a particular registrar in order
to have a reasonable chance of discovering most or all of
the squatter’s holdings with that registrar. This should
signiﬁcantly help combat bulk bad faith domain name
registrations. Changes
facilitate
actions to reclaim domain names in large numbers,
which should encourage brand owners to be more
aggressive in their enforcement efforts. These steps alone
will be useful because they will allow brand owners to
compete with cybersquatters on a scale that matches the
scope of modern cybersquatting operations.
the
continued
availability of
from squatted
domain names will create a continuing incentive for
cybersquatters to operate, and to expand when techno-
logical advances like IDNs or the introduction of new
gTLDs permit. The updated anti-cybersquatting regime
would counter that incentive by making it more likely
that cybersquatters will be subjected to the penalties
available under national IP laws. Brand owners who
can leverage a favorable UDRP ruling in national
courts by using it to prove a prima facie case of in-
fringement will have an additional incentive to step up
their enforcement efforts because the chances will
increase that a particular action will result in an award
of monetary damages to defray the cost of the enforce-
ment effort. Even if national courts initially resist the
coordinated use of the UDRP and national
laws by

ﬁnding fault with panel decisions applying their
national
law, the system should be self-correcting as
those court decisions provide more speciﬁc guidance
that future panels can use to render more sustainable
decisions.

The combination of more efﬁcient administrative
proceedings to reclaim squatted domain names and the
increased risk of penalties for cybersquatters should
buttress the anti-cybersquatting regime in the areas
that modern cybersquatters have exploited so success-
fully to date. The results will be neither automatic nor

perfect. Brand owners will need to increase their enfor-
cement efforts for the updates to have any practical
effect, and cybersquatters will adapt by moving their
operations beyond the reach of effective legal enforce-
ment or developing new tools to fragment their portfo-
lios. Nevertheless, the updated regime would go a long
way toward creating the enforcement and deterrent
mechanisms lacking from the current regime.
