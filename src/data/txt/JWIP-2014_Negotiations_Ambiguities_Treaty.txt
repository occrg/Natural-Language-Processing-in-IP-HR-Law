Patent Law Treaty: Promises Not Delivered-How the
Negotiations Resulted in Ambiguities in the Treaty

Cees Mulder
Maastricht University, The Netherlands

The Patent Law Treaty was drafted with the aim to ‚Äústreamline and harmonize‚Äù formal requirements set by national or
regional Patent OfÔ¨Åces for the Ô¨Åling of national or regional patent applications and the maintenance of patents. In this
Article, a number of core issues of the Patent Law Treaty has been selected: requirements for the accordance of a Ô¨Åling
date, relief in respect of time limits and restoration of priority. A conclusion of this Article is that the goals of the Patent
Law Treaty were not achieved by the Treaty as concluded. One of the reasons is that the Treaty contains too many
optional requirements (‚Äúmay require‚Äù), which may be implemented as compulsory by the Contracting Parties,
allowing them too much freedom when implementing requirements of the Treaty into their national and regional
patent laws. This deÔ¨Åes the aim of harmonization and streamlining of the Patent Law Treaty. The negotiation history is
described and discussed with emphasis on what went wrong during the negotiations. Reasons for the failure of the
Patent Law Treaty are discussed and recommendations for repair are given.

Introduction to Patent Law Treaty

The Patent Law Treaty (PLT) was concluded during a Diplomatic Conference held at the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva (Switzerland) from May 11 to June 2, 2000.1 The
PLT is open to States member of WIPO and/or States party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of
Industrial Property;2 it is also open to certain intergovernmental organizations, such as the European
Patent Organization.3 Instruments of ratiÔ¨Åcation or accession must be deposited with the Director General
of WIPO. The PLT entered into force on April 28, 2005.

The PLT emanated from discussions on the reform of substantive patent law that began in 1984.
Those discussions continued until June 1991, during which a Ô¨Årst part of a Diplomatic Conference to
conclude a ‚ÄúTreaty Supplementing the Paris Convention as far as Patents are Concerned.‚Äù4 The second
part of the Diplomatic Conference was scheduled for July 1993, but did never take place. In January 1994,
the United States discontinued substantive patent law harmonization discussions due to a lack of domestic
support for the effort.5 The international community was disappointed by the ensuing ‚Äúloss of momentum‚Äù
on the subject of substantive patent law harmonization as a result of the position of the United States.
In 1995, it was agreed that another approach for promoting harmonization, covering matters
concerning the formality requirements of national and regional patent procedures, would be initiated by
WIPO.6 Five sessions of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty,7 and three sessions of its
successor, the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents (SCP),8 were held to develop the ‚ÄúBasic
Proposal‚Äù to be presented to the Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty, which
was held from May 11 to June 2, 2000.9,10

The Final Act of the PLT witnessing the Diplomatic Conference and its outcome, was signed by 104
countries and 3 Intergovernmental Organizations. At present 66 countries signed the PLT. In 2005 the
PLT was in force in 11 countries; currently (October 2014) there are 36 Contracting Parties.11

The PLT includes 27 articles and 21 rules. In addition, six ‚ÄúAgreed Statements‚Äù were adopted at the

end of the Conference.12

Aim and Purpose of the PLT

Since the adoption of the PLT, the involvement of the WIPO has diminished as there are no centralized
functions. The International Bureau of WIPO merely acts as a depository of the PLT and is not in a
position to give an ofÔ¨Åcial interpretation of the Treaty; such interpretation being in the exclusive
competence of the PLT Contracting Parties.

The PLT aims at harmonizing and streamlining formal procedures relating to national and regional
patent applications and maintenance of patents. In spite of the goal of harmonization, the PLT does not
establish a uniform procedure for all PLT Contracting Parties by leaving many requirements optional,
thereby allowing divergence in implementation between PLT Contracting Parties.13

The PLT sets forth, with one exception, maximum formal/procedural requirements that Contracting
Parties may impose on patent applicants and patentees. Otherwise, PLT Contracting Parties are free to
provide requirements that, from the viewpoint of applicants and owners, are more favorable than PLT
requirements.14 The one exception to this freedom are the Ô¨Åling date requirements, which are both a
maximum and a minimum, i.e., a so-called ‚ÄúÔ¨Åling-date standard.‚Äù15

The aim of the PLT is to simplify the formal obligations and to reduce the associated costs for patent
applicants and owners of patents in obtaining and preserving their rights in inventions in many countries of
the world. The PLT complements the existing international obligations and fosters the policy of strong
intellectual property protection. The PLT simpliÔ¨Åes the Ô¨Åling of an application and obtaining and
maintaining of patents throughout the world and, to a large extent, promotes the merging of national and
international formal requirements associated with patent applications and patents.

In a birds‚Äô eye view, the principle features of the PLT offer the following advantages:

 The PLT simpliÔ¨Åes and minimizes application requirements for obtaining a Ô¨Åling date;
 The PLT imposes a maximum on the formal requirements that a PLT Contracting Party may impose;
 The PLT eases representation requirements for formal matters;
 The PLT provides a basis for means of communications, including the electronic Ô¨Åling of applications;
 The PLT provides relief in respect of time limits that may be imposed by the OfÔ¨Åce of a PLT

Contracting Party and re-instatement of rights where an applicant or owner has unintentionally failed to
comply with a time limit and that failure has the direct consequence of causing a loss of rights; and

 The PLT provides for correction or addition of priority claims and restoration of priority rights.

A main feature of the PLT is that it provides standardized formality requirements for patent
applications, which are Ô¨Åled with a national or regional patent OfÔ¨Åce. Instead of deÔ¨Åning these
requirements again or differently in the PLT, it was decided to incorporate by reference the provisions
of the PCT and its Regulations, wherever appropriate, into the PLT (see Mulder (2011a) for a discussion
of the issue of ‚ÄúIncorporation by reference of PCT provisions into the PLT‚Äù). The main reason for
this is that the PCT already regulates in detail the formality requirements with respect to patent
applications.16

From the viewpoint of inventors, applicants and patent attorneys, standardization and simpliÔ¨Åcation
of the formality requirements lead to a reduced risk of formality errors resulting in a less frequent loss of
rights. On the other hand, OfÔ¨Åces may operate more efÔ¨Åciently because of the simpliÔ¨Åcation of procedures
and the streamlining of the process. Eventually, this will result in cost reductions on both sides.

After the failure in 1994 of the earlier ‚ÄúTreaty Supplementing the Paris Convention as far as Patents
are Concerned,‚Äù there was an eagerness to conclude a new Treaty which was limited to cover matters
concerning the formality requirements of national and regional patent procedures. This pushing ahead has
resulted in the introduction of weaknesses into the PLT. In particular, the achievement of the goal of the

Patent Law Treaty

PLT to ‚Äústreamline and harmonize‚Äù formal requirements was often disregarded if a negotiating party
insisted to have certain measures implemented into the PLT, which reÔ¨Çected peculiarities of its national
law. This has resulted in a Treaty which allows too much freedom when a Contracting Party implements
the basic requirements of the PLT into its national or regional patent law.

Basic Features of the PLT
In a number of documents, the main features of the PLT are described.17,18,19 In the following paragraphs a
condensed overview of these principle features is presented.

Filing Date Requirements
The accordance of a date of Ô¨Åling is essential to deciding who has priority for the grant of a patent in each
country and to determining prior art and the patentability of the invention. It is also relevant to claiming a
right of priority under the Paris Convention as well as to the calculation of the term of patent protection.
Article 5 PLT sets a maximum and minimum set of requirements for obtaining a Ô¨Åling date and
procedures to avoid loss of the Ô¨Åling date because of a failure to comply with other formality requirements.
In principle, the OfÔ¨Åce of any PLT Contracting Party is obliged to accord a Ô¨Åling date to an application on
the basis of only three elements. These requirements are (Article 5(1)(a) PLT):

(i) an indication that what is Ô¨Åled is intended to be a patent application;
(ii) indications identifying the applicant or allowing the applicant to be contacted; and
(iii) a part which on the face of it appears to be a description.

No additional element can be required for a Ô¨Åling date to be accorded. In particular, a PLT Contracting
Party cannot require the presence of one or more claims as a Ô¨Åling date requirement. In addition, an
applicant can Ô¨Åle the description in any language (Article 5(2)(b) PLT), or replace the description and/or
drawings by a reference to a previously Ô¨Åled application (Article 5(7) PLT). A PLT Contracting Party
may, for the purposes of the Ô¨Åling date, accept a drawing as the element referred to Article 5(1)(a)(iii) PLT
(Article 5(1)(b) PLT).

The PLT also provides rules to establish a Ô¨Åling date where a part of the description or drawing is
missing from the initially Ô¨Åled application. Normally, the Ô¨Åling of a missing part results in the accordance
of a later Ô¨Åling date, i.e., the Ô¨Åling date becomes the date on which the missing part or missing drawing is
Ô¨Åled (Article 5(6)(a) PLT). However, if the application claims priority of an earlier application and the
missing part or drawing is ‚Äúcompletely contained‚Äù in the earlier application, the originally accorded Ô¨Åling
date will be maintained (Article 5(6)(b) PLT).

Standardized Application and Forms
A main feature of the PLT is that it provides standardized formality requirements for patent applications,
which are Ô¨Åled with a national or regional patent OfÔ¨Åce. Instead of deÔ¨Åning these requirements again or
differently in the PLT, it was decided to incorporate by reference the provisions of the PCT and its
Regulations, wherever appropriate, into the PLT (Article 6(1) PLT). In addition, the PLT provides for the
establishment of several Model International Forms that have to be accepted by all OfÔ¨Åces of PLT
Contracting Parties (Article 6(2) and 8(3) PLT).

Simplified Procedures Before the Office
‚ÄúSimpliÔ¨Åcation‚Äù is one of the keywords for the PLT. The PLT simpliÔ¨Åes a number of procedures before the
OfÔ¨Åce of PLT Contracting Parties during the processing of a patent application, as well as for the
maintenance of a patent.

Patent Law Treaty

Cees Mulder

The PLT allows an OfÔ¨Åce of a PLT Contracting Party to require an applicant or owner to appoint a
representative for the purposes of any procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce, except for certain procedures (Article 7
(2) PLT). In addition, an OfÔ¨Åce may only require the applicant to Ô¨Åle evidence in support of the formal
contents of an application, declarations of priority or the authentication of translations when the OfÔ¨Åce has
a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness of the indications or the accuracy of the translation submitted by
the applicant (Article 6(6) PLT). As regards signature, a PLT Contracting Party may require evidence only
where the OfÔ¨Åce has a reasonable doubt as to its authenticity (Article 8(4)(c) PLT).

A PLT Contracting Party may not require the applicant to Ô¨Åle a copy or a certiÔ¨Åed copy of the earlier
application or the previously Ô¨Åled application if such earlier application or previously Ô¨Åled application has
been Ô¨Åled with the OfÔ¨Åce of that Contracting Party (Rule 4(3) PLT). The same applies to cases where the
OfÔ¨Åce could obtain the copy or the certiÔ¨Åcation from other OfÔ¨Åces through a digital library, which is
accepted by that OfÔ¨Åce for that purpose (Rule 4(3) PLT). In addition, an OfÔ¨Åce may require a translation of
the earlier application only where the validity of the priority claim is relevant to the determination of
whether the invention concerned is patentable (Rule 4(4) PLT).

Avoiding Loss of Rights
Apart from the Ô¨Åling date requirements, one of the principal features of the PLT is that it prescribes
procedures for the avoidance of unintentional loss of rights as a result of failure to comply with formality
requirements. It can be regarded as a breakthrough of the PLT that for all these measures of relief, time
limits with a duration of at least two months are speciÔ¨Åed.

Relief in Respect of Time Limits
In principle, the PLT provides three types of relief procedures. The Ô¨Årst is an extension of the time limit
(for at least 2 months) where an applicant or owner requests the extension prior to the expiration of
the time limit (Article 11(1)(i) PLT). The second is an extension of the time limit (again for at least 2
months) where an applicant or owner requests the extension after the expiration of the unobserved time
limit (Article 11(1)(ii) PLT). The third remedy is the provision of continued processing (Article 11(2)
PLT).

A PLT Contracting Party is not obliged to provide the Ô¨Årst type of extension (extension prior to the
expiration of the time limit). However, it is obliged to provide either the second type of extension
(extension after the expiration of the time limit) or continued processing. Relief under these provisions is
limited to non-compliance with a time limit Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce for an action in a procedure before the
OfÔ¨Åce; it does not apply to time limits the duration of which is Ô¨Åxed in the law.

Reinstatement of Rights
Another safeguard provision established by the PLT is the provision of reinstatement of rights if an
applicant or owner fails to meet a time limit and, as a consequence, loses his rights with respect to an
application or patent unintentionally or in spite of all due care required by the circumstances (Article 12
PLT). The time limit to request reinstatement of rights shall not be less than 2 months from the date on
which the reason of the non-compliance with the time limit is removed, or not less than 12 months from the
expiration of the missed time limit, whichever is shorter (Article 13(2) PLT). In contrast to the relief in
respect of time limits, reinstatement of rights is applicable to all time limits, including time limits of which
the duration is Ô¨Åxed in the law.

Correction and Addition of a Priority Claim
The PLT provides for the possibility of addition and correction of priority claims for national/regional
applications (Article 13 PLT). This provision was copied into the PLT from the already existing provision
in PCT Rule 26bis.1.20

Patent Law Treaty

Restoration of the Priority Right
Another safeguard provision established by the PLT is the provision of restoration of the priority right.
There are two cases to be considered. In the Ô¨Årst case, restoration of the priority right must be provided
where an application is Ô¨Åled after the expiration of the 12-month priority period if the failure to claim
priority within the Paris Convention period occurred in spite of all due care taken by the applicant or was
unintentional (Article 13(2) PLT). The request for restoration including the Ô¨Åling of the application must
be made within a time limit of at least 2 months from the date on which the priority period expired.

In the second case, restoration of the priority right must be provided where an applicant cannot submit
a copy of an earlier application within 16 months from the priority date because of a delay in the OfÔ¨Åce
with which the earlier application was Ô¨Åled (Article 13(3) PLT).

Paper and Electronic Communications
One of the goals of the PLT is to facilitate the implementation of electronic Ô¨Åling of applications and other
communications while, at the same time, not excluding any users from the beneÔ¨Åts of the patent system, if
they are not ready to apply electronic Ô¨Åling.

In principle, a PLT Contracting Party may,

implementation of full electronic Ô¨Åling) with certain exceptions (Rule 8 PLT). These exceptions are the
obligation on all OfÔ¨Åces to accord a Ô¨Åling date for a paper application (Article 5(1) PLT), and to accept the
Ô¨Åling of communications on paper for the purpose of meeting a time limit (Article 8(1)(d) PLT).

if it so wishes, exclude paper Ô¨Åling (i.e.

Methodology

The research methodology used in this Article mainly consists of an analysis of the documents in relation
to the negotiation history of the PLT. In particular, the reports and preparatory documents of the sessions
of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty in the period from December 1995 to
December 1997, and the sessions of the SCP in the period from June 1998 to September 1999 have been
studied.21,22 In addition, the Summary Minutes of the Main Committees during the Diplomatic Conference
for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty held in Geneva in the period May-June 2000 have been
studied.23 Where necessary, the documents in relation to the 1991 Diplomatic Conference for the adoption
of the ‚ÄúTreaty Supplementing the Paris Convention as far as Patents are Concerned‚Äù in The Hague were
taken into account.24

The majority of the Travaux Pre¬¥ paratoires of the PLT is not directly available to the public. Some of
the later preparatory documents are accessible and downloadable from web pages of the WIPO. However,
the earlier versions of the ‚ÄúDraft PLT Articles and Draft Regulations‚Äù including the corresponding
‚ÄúNotes,‚Äù ‚ÄúReports‚Äù and other related documents can be accessed by requesting the WIPO to make them
available.25

Information has also been gathered by speaking with representatives of the Patent Law Section and
the Patent Cooperation Treaty Legal Division of the WIPO and with representatives of the Directorate-
General Legal and International Affairs of the European Patent OfÔ¨Åce. These conversations have been
conducted off the record following the request of the persons involved not to be quoted in an explicit
manner.

Negotiation History of the PLT

Five sessions of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty in the period from December 1995 to
December 1997,26 and three sessions of the SCP in the period from June 1998 to September 1999,27 were
held in Geneva to come to the ‚ÄúBasic Proposal‚Äù of the PLT and its Regulations which was presented to the

Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty in Geneva from May 11 to June 2,
2000.28,29

As indicated above, the original negotiations to come to a ‚ÄúPatent Law Treaty‚Äù (ofÔ¨Åcially addressed
as the ‚ÄúTreaty Supplementing the Paris Convention as far as Patents are Concerned‚Äù;30 also addressed as
the ‚ÄúPatent Harmonization Treaty‚Äù) that would harmonize formal as well as substantive patent law
stranded in January 1994 when the United States declared that it was unable to continue the discussions
because of a lack of domestic support.31

In 1995, the WIPO initiated another approach for promoting harmonization whereby only matters
concerning the formality requirements of national and regional patent procedures would be
covered.32,33,34 Convened by the Director General following decisions made by the General Assembly
of WIPO and the Assembly of the Paris Union in their meetings of September/October 1995,35,36 the
Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty held its Ô¨Årst session in Geneva in December 1995. The
meetings of the Committee were attended by representatives of States members of WIPO and/or the Paris
Union. Representatives of the European Communities, the European Patent OfÔ¨Åce, the Organization of
African Unity and the World Trade Organization as well as representatives of numerous non-
governmental organizations took part in the sessions in an observer capacity.

During the meetings of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty the delegation of the
United States repeated time after time ‚Äúthat it was still not in a position to discuss substantive patent law
harmonization.‚Äù37 In addition, the delegation continuously expressed its concern about any requirement
present in or introduced into the Draft PLT that could be regarded as a substantive requirement. By way of
example, in the Draft PLT as presented at the second session of Committee of Experts on the Patent Law
Treaty, there was a new Article on unity of invention (Article 6 and corresponding implementing Rule 6)
which was regarded as ‚Äúnot appropriate for inclusion in this Treaty directed to formalities‚Äù as observed by
the delegation of the United States.38 In the Draft PLT as presented at the fourth session of the Committee
of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty the Article on ‚Äúunity of invention‚Äù was deleted.

In March 1998, the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO and the Unions administered by the
WIPO approved a proposal for the establishment of ‚ÄúStanding Committees.‚Äù39,40 The SCP became the
successor of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty. Because considerable progress had
already been made, three sessions of the SCP (in June 1998, April 1999 and September 1999) were
sufÔ¨Åcient to convene a Diplomatic Conference in Geneva to conclude the PLT and the Regulations under
the PLT (May 11 to June 2, 2000).

In this Article, aspects of the negotiation history will be described with respect to three core issues of

the PLT (parts of this Article were incorporated in Mulder, 2011b). These are:

(1) Requirements for the accordance of a Ô¨Åling date (Article 5 PLT). The focus will be on the following

three issues:

 The basic requirements for according a Ô¨Åling date (Article 5(1) PLT);
 The Ô¨Åling date where a missing part of the description or a missing drawing is Ô¨Åled (Article 5(6)
 The Ô¨Åling of an application by reference to a previously Ô¨Åled application (Article 5(7) PLT).

PLT);

(2) Relief in respect of time limits including continued processing (Article 11 PLT) and reinstatement of

rights after a Ô¨Ånding of due care or unintentionality by the OfÔ¨Åce (Article12 PLT).

(3) Restoration of the priority right (Article 13(2) and (3) PLT).

None of the above subjects was present in the Draft PLT put before the Committee of Experts on the
Patent Law Treaty at its Ô¨Årst session in December 1995, although some of the later added provisions were
modeled after texts in the Basic Proposal submitted to the 1991 Diplomatic Conference in The Hague.41

Filing Date Requirements

Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty
In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the Ô¨Årst
session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty there was no article on requirements for
accordance of a Ô¨Åling date.42 This was also noted in the corresponding ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù prepared by the
International Bureau.43 In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts, many delegations favored,
amongst other things, the inclusion in the PLT of provisions relating to requirements for the accordance of
a Ô¨Åling date.44

As a consequence a Ô¨Årst draft of an Article 3 PLT ‚ÄúFiling Date‚Äù was presented before the Committee
on its second session.45 The text was modeled after Article 8 of the Basic Proposal submitted to the 1991
Diplomatic Conference in relation to the ‚ÄúPatent Harmonization Treaty.‚Äù46 The Ô¨Åling date requirements
contained 4 items:

Article 3(1) (Requirements)

(a) The Ô¨Åling date of the application shall be the date of receipt by the OfÔ¨Åce of a communication

containing the following elements:

(i) an express or implicit indication to the effect that the communication is an application for a

patent;

(ii) indications allowing the identity of the applicant to be established;
(iii) a description;
(iv) if the description is not in the language or in one of the languages of or admitted by the OfÔ¨Åce, an

indication to the effect that the application contains a description.

In the corresponding ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau, it was remarked that Article 3 sets
an international standard for the granting of a Ô¨Åling date. In that respect, Article 3 is different from other
provisions of the Treaty, which establish a maximum list of allowed requirements.47 In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù
adopted by the Committee of Experts, many delegations noted with satisfaction that a provision on the
Ô¨Åling date had been included.48 Several delegations proposed that the payment of a Ô¨Åling fee should be a
requirement for a Ô¨Åling date to be accorded; this proposal was rejected by a majority of delegations.49
Several delegations also suggested that the inclusion of claims should be a requirement for a Ô¨Åling date to
be accorded. This suggestion was opposed by a majority of delegations, which were of the view that,
although claims were necessary before a patent could be granted, it was not necessary to furnish them at
the date of Ô¨Åling.50

In the third session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, Article 3 PLT on ‚ÄúFiling
Date‚Äù was renumbered to become Article 2 PLT.51 In addition, a new paragraph (4) was added to the
Article allowing an applicant to replace the description and drawings by reference to another application
from which priority is claimed; in addition, a certiÔ¨Åed copy of the earlier application must be furnished to
the OfÔ¨Åce within a prescribed time limit. This provision was modeled after Article 8(4) of the Basic
Proposal submitted to the 1991 Diplomatic Conference in relation to the ‚ÄúPatent Harmonization Treaty.‚Äù52
In the subsequent ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts, it was agreed that the paragraph on
‚ÄúÔ¨Åling by reference‚Äù would be maintained.53 Several delegations suggested that the applicant should be
required to furnish details concerning the date and country of Ô¨Åling of the previously Ô¨Åled application or
even that the title of that application should be indicated.54 It was also suggested that the provision should
not be restricted to those applications in respect of which priority is claimed.55 The delegation of the
United States of America suggested that the paragraph should provide for the electronic exchange of
documents between OfÔ¨Åces in place of submitting certiÔ¨Åed copies.56 The International Bureau explained

166

Patent Law Treaty

that if the required certiÔ¨Åed copy of the previously Ô¨Åled application were not Ô¨Åled, the application
containing a reference to that previously Ô¨Åled application would be considered as not having been Ô¨Åled.57
Eventually, many suggestions were honored in the later versions of the PLT. In addition, the regulatory
requirements relating to ‚ÄúÔ¨Åling by reference to a previously Ô¨Åled application‚Äù were moved to the
Regulations under the PLT and, due to lack of agreement between the delegations, contain a puzzling mix
of compulsory requirements (‚Äúshall‚Äù) and optional requirements which may be implemented as
compulsory (‚Äúmay require‚Äù) by a PLT Contracting Party (see Rule 2(5) PLT: Requirements under Article
5(7)(a) PLT). The pile of optional requirements which may be implemented as compulsory by a PLT
Contracting Party, allows too much freedom when implementing requirements of the PLT into its national
and regional patent laws and is contrary to the aim of harmonization and streamlining as advocated by the
PLT.

In the meantime, the WIPO General Assembly and the Assembly of the Paris Union58 considering a
Memorandum by the Director General in respect of Matters Concerning the Patent Law Treaty, decided,
amongst others, to include Ô¨Åling date provisions in the draft PLT.59

In the fourth session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, Article 2 PLT on ‚ÄúFiling
Date‚Äù was renumbered to become Article 4 PLT.60 The formulation ‚Äúa description‚Äù in item (iii) of Article
4(1)(a) PLT of the requirements for accordance of a Ô¨Åling date was broadened to read: ‚Äúa part which on the
face of it appears to be a description,‚Äù this formulation is identical to the one in PCT Article 11(1)(iii)(d).
In addition, in item ii of Article 4(1)(a) PLT, apart from ‚Äúindications allowing the identity of the applicant
‚Ä¶ to be established,‚Äù a formulation was added ‚Äúor allowing the applicant ‚Ä¶ to be contacted by the
OfÔ¨Åce.‚Äù For example, where the application indicates the address without any name and there is only one
resident at that address, the requirement of Article 4(1)(a)(ii) PLT would be regarded as having been
complied with.

In the Draft PLT, a new item (b) was added to Article 4(3) PLT (subsequent compliance with
requirements) in relation to the late Ô¨Åling of drawings. If the applicant Ô¨Åles missing drawings later on, the
Ô¨Åling date would become the date on which the OfÔ¨Åce has received those drawings. Where these ‚Äúlater
furnished drawings do not contain new matter‚Äù the original Ô¨Åling date may be retained. In the ‚ÄúReport,‚Äù the
International Bureau commented that the standard applied by a PLT Contracting Party in determining
whether later furnished drawings contained ‚Äúnew matter‚Äù was a matter of substance.61

In the Ô¨Åfth session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty there were no substantial
changes in Article 4 PLT on ‚ÄúFiling Date‚Äù.62 A new item (c) was added to Article 4(3) PLT in relation to
missing drawings and missing parts of the description, a provision according to which, where priority is
claimed in the application, the contents of the priority document has to be taken into account in
establishing whether correction by way of furnishing a missing part of the description or missing drawing
should be allowed without loss of the initial Ô¨Åling date.63

Standing Committee on the Law of Patents
In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the Ô¨Årst
session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Article 4(1)(a) PLT was restricted to three
items:64

Article 4(1) (Elements of Application)

(a) Subject to paragraphs (2) to (5), a Contracting Party shall provide that the Ô¨Åling date of an
application shall be the date on which its OfÔ¨Åce has received all of the following elements, Ô¨Åled by
means permitted by the OfÔ¨Åce:

(i) an express or implicit indication to the effect that the elements are intended to be an application;

Patent Law Treaty

(ii) indications allowing the identity of the applicant to be established or allowing the applicant to be

contacted by the OfÔ¨Åce;

(iii) a part which on the face of it appears to be a description;

The above formulations of the Ô¨Åling date requirements are already relatively close to the texts adopted

during the Diplomatic Conference.

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù presented at the Ô¨Årst session of the Standing Committee on
the Law of Patents, the provision permitting an applicant to replace the description and any drawings in an
application by reference to a previously Ô¨Åled application in respect of the same invention was no longer
restricted to references to applications from which priority is claimed, but broadened to also cover
references to any previously Ô¨Åled application by the same applicant or his predecessor in title (Article 4(7)
PLT).65

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
second session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, there were no substantial changes in
Article 4 PLT on ‚ÄúFiling Date‚Äù.66 Following a proposal by the delegation of Australia with respect to the
paragraph in Article 4 PLT in relation to the Ô¨Åling of missing parts of the description and missing
drawings, and suggestions by the International Bureau based on this proposal, the formulation ‚Äúthe
missing part of the description and the missing drawing ‚Ä¶ do not contain new matter‚Äù in paragraph (5) of
Article 4 PLT, was replaced by ‚Äúthe missing part of the description or missing drawing be completely
contained in the earlier application‚Äù; this formulation was incorporated in a new paragraph of the Rule
regulating the details concerning the Ô¨Åling date requirements under Article 4 PLT.67,68

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
third session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Article 4 PLT on ‚ÄúFiling Date‚Äù and
implementing Rule 2 PLT were ‚Äúframed‚Äù indicating that the Article and Rule had been adopted by the
Standing Committee.69 Two amendments are worth mentioning. The Ô¨Årst one is that a new item was added
to the requirements of Rule 2(4) PLT in relation to the situation where the applicant Ô¨Åles missing parts of the
description or missing drawings based on an earlier application from which priority is claimed (Article 4(6)
(b) PLT), i.e. that ‚Äúthe application, at the time of Ô¨Åling, contained an indication that the contents of the earlier
application were incorporated by reference in the application‚Äù.70 The second one is that in Article 4(6)(b)
PLT relating to the situation where the applicant Ô¨Åles missing parts of the description or missing drawings
based on an earlier application from which priority is claimed, the words ‚Äúat the time of Ô¨Åling‚Äù were replaced
by the words ‚Äúat the date on which one or more elements referred to in Article 4(1)(a) were Ô¨Årst received by
the OfÔ¨Åce‚Äù.71 It is noted that all requirements in Rule 2(4) PLT are of the kind ‚Äúmay require‚Äù: this allows a
PLT Contracting Party to select its own mix of compulsory requirements when implementing the Ô¨Åling of
missing parts of the description or missing drawings based on an earlier application. This freedom of choice
is contrary to the aim of the PLT to streamline and harmonize formal requirements.

Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the PLT
In the Draft Proposal submitted to the Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty
submitted by the Director General of WIPO, Article 4 PLT on ‚ÄúFiling Date‚Äù was renumbered to become
Article 5 PLT.72

Issues relevant for the Draft PLT were discussed at a session of the PCT Assembly held in
March 2000; these issues were summarized in a document submitted for consideration to the PLT
Diplomatic Conference.73 In relation to the Ô¨Åling date requirements, it was suggested that a discussion
should take place at the Diplomatic Conference on the question of amending draft Article 5(1) PLT,
perhaps in a general way or subject to future amendments of the Regulations, in order to allow applicants
to obtain a Ô¨Åling date using future technologies.74

During the meetings at the Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty, the
Ô¨Åling date requirements were extensively discussed.75,76 Of course, the issue of adding a fourth item: ‚Äú(iv)
a part which on the face appears to a claim or claims‚Äù was brought up and rejected (again).77

It was observed by a representative of the WIPO, that PCT Article 11(1) was also relevant as the PCT
was the starting point for the provision on the Ô¨Åling date in Article 5(1) PLT.78 The drafting of the PLT
had closely followed the PCT, although, in some cases, it had been deemed that the PLT should be more
user-friendly. In PCT Article 11(1), there are seven requirements for according a Ô¨Åling date under
the PCT. Two of those requirements would not apply to national Ô¨Ålings, because they dealt with
residency requirements and the designation of a PLT Contracting State. Of the remaining Ô¨Åve, three
corresponded to items in the PLT. There were two remaining items in the Ô¨Åling date requirements for the
PCT where the PLT was more liberal, namely the inclusion of claims and the language requirements.79 A
Representative of the European Patent Organization said that Article 5(1) PLT was perhaps the most
important provision in the draft PLT, as it established a uniform worldwide standard; any possible
deviation from this standard, including the possibility for national OfÔ¨Åces to require a fee, should
be avoided.80 Eventually, the three items of Article 5(1)(a) PLT for establishing a Ô¨Åling date were
maintained as proposed.

In addition, the language requirements in Article 5(2) PLT were adopted in relation to the languages
in which the three items of Article 5(1)(a) PLT can be Ô¨Åled.81 It was observed by a representative of the
WIPO that the possibility of Ô¨Åling the description of an application in any language was one of the key
issues of the draft PLT.82

With respect to Article 5(5) PLT relating to the notiÔ¨Åcation concerning a missing part of the
description or a missing drawing, a representative of the WIPO emphasized that an OfÔ¨Åce would not be
required to make any special check for missing descriptions or drawings; also, Article 5(5) PLT did not
apply where the OfÔ¨Åce discovered the omission in a different procedure, for example in the course of
substantive examination.83 With regard to Article 5(6) PLT relating to the situation where the missing part
of the description or the missing drawing was Ô¨Åled subsequently, the representative of the WIPO pointed
out that the Ô¨Åling date would, under Article 5(6)(a) PLT, be the date on which the missing part of the
description or missing drawing was received by the OfÔ¨Åce, whereas Article 5(6)(b) and (c) PLT addressed
two situations in which the earlier date of receipt of the incomplete application could be preserved as the
Ô¨Åling date.84 Article 5(5) and (6) PLT were meant to give an applicant the opportunity to Ô¨Åle missing parts
as quickly as possible in order to minimize the loss of Ô¨Åling date.85

With respect to Article 5(7) PLT allowing an applicant to replace the description or the drawings by a
reference to an earlier application, a representative of the WIPO emphasized that it is a very user-friendly
provision.86 The representative of the Institute of Professional Representatives before the European
Patent OfÔ¨Åce (epi) said that Ô¨Åling by reference would particularly be beneÔ¨Åcial for small applicants who
had to Ô¨Åle in the last minute before the expiration of the priority period, and who were not interested in
applying in a great number of countries, and therefore did not want to incur the cost of a PCT application.87

Conclusion
From the above overview of the negotiations, it can be concluded that Article 5 PLT is a breakthrough in
that it simpliÔ¨Åes and minimizes application requirements for obtaining a Ô¨Åling date. However, even the
text of article comprises at least two formulations specifying optional requirements, which may be
implemented as compulsory (‚Äúmay require‚Äù) by a PLT Contracting Party. Furthermore, Rule 2 PLT
implementing Article 5 PLT includes a complicated mix of ‚Äúshall‚Äù and ‚Äúmay require‚Äù requirements. The
majority of the latter requirements results from speciÔ¨Åc wishes of negotiating parties to insert a certain
optional requirement into the draft Treaty. The inclusion of ‚Äúmay require‚Äù formulations should have been
avoided or at least minimized because it introduces too much freedom for PLT Contracting Parties when

implementing requirements of the PLT into their national and regional patent laws. This abundance of
‚Äúmay require‚Äù formulations is contrary to the aim of harmonization and streamlining of the PLT.

Relief in Respect of Time Limits

Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty
In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the Ô¨Årst
session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, there was no article on relief in respect of
time limits.88 In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts, a number of delegations favored,
amongst other things, the inclusion in the PLT of provisions relating to the extension of speciÔ¨Åc time
limits.89

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
third session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, there was a new Article 12 PLT
‚ÄúExtension of a time limit‚Äù.90 Article 12 PLT sets a minimum of rights a Contracting Party shall extend to
an applicant or owner in respect of a request for an extension of a time limit. It is to be noted that this
Article deals with the time limit for an action before the OfÔ¨Åce, and not the time limit before a court.91
Article 12(1) PLT addresses the situation in which an applicant or owner requests the extension of a time
limit before that time limit has expired. However, in accordance with subparagraph (c), the term does not
include the submission of a priority claim for which a new Article 13 PLT (belated claiming of priority)
was introduced. An OfÔ¨Åce would not be permitted to impose any payment of a fee for the Ô¨Årst extension of
the time limit.92 Article 12(2) PLT addresses the situation in which an applicant or owner requests the
extension of a time limit after that time limit has expired. Subparagraph (b) is intended to prevent that an
applicant or owner loses rights attached to his application or other communication because of a failure to
meet a time limit if he has taken all due care required by the circumstances to comply with the time limit.93
In the meantime, the WIPO General Assembly and the Assembly of the Paris Union (meeting in
September/October 1996) considering a Memorandum by the Director General in respect of Matters
Concerning the Patent Law Treaty, decided, amongst others, to include provisions relating to restoration
of rights where a time limit has been missed (including ‚Äúfurther processing‚Äù) and extension of time limits
which have not yet expired but whose extension has been requested by the party concerned.94

In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts of the third session, many delegations and
representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations supported the principle of
harmonization of extension of time limits expressed in Article 12 PLT.95 However, several delegations
expressed the view that it was necessary to differentiate between time limits established by law or
convention and those established by the OfÔ¨Åce. By way of example, several delegations observed that the
time limit for the payment of fees for the maintenance of industrial property rights should not be extensible
beyond what was prescribed by Article 5bis of the Paris Convention.96

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
fourth session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, Article 12 PLT was renumbered to
become Article 13 PLT and new Article 14 PLT was introduced.97 Article 13 PLT sets a minimum of
rights a PLT Contracting Party must extend to an applicant or owner in respect of a request for an extension
of a time limit established by the OfÔ¨Åce whereas the extension of time limits established by national
legislation or regional treaty is regulated by Article 14 PLT.98 Article 13(1) PLT addresses the situation in
which an applicant or owner requests the extension of a time limit established by the OfÔ¨Åce before that
time limit has expired whereas Article 13(2) PLT addresses the situation in which an applicant or owner
requests the extension of a time limit established by the OfÔ¨Åce after that time limit has expired.99 Article
14 PLT sets a minimum of rights a PLT Contracting Party must extend to an applicant or owner concerned
in respect of a request for an extension of a time limit established by national legislation or under a treaty
providing for the grant of regional patents. Except in respect of intervening rights (Article 14(5) PLT), any

PLT Contracting Party would be free to be more liberal in granting such an extension. As in the case of
Article 13 PLT, it was be noted that Article 14 PLT deals with the time limit for an action before the OfÔ¨Åce,
and not the time limit before a court.100

In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts it was agreed that Article 13(2) PLT related to
restoration, not extension, and should be transferred to Article 14 PLT.101 In addition, a proposal by the
delegation of the United States of America that the concept ‚Äúin spite of due care required by the
circumstances‚Äù be replaced by the concept ‚Äúthe failure to comply was unintentional‚Äù was approved.102
Relief in the form of ‚Äúfurther processing‚Äù or restoration of rights may be available in the case where
the time limit to request extension of a time limit has expired.103 In particular, Article 14(1)(a) PLT was
introduced following the approval by the previous session of the Committee of Experts that a proposal
providing for ‚Äúfurther processing‚Äù should generally be permitted on the mere basis of a request and the
payment of a fee.104 Further processing under this provision would be restricted to the cases in which an
application is to be, or has been, refused or considered withdrawn or abandoned following failure to
comply with a time limit Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce for an action before the OfÔ¨Åce.105

In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts, the Representative of the European Patent
Organization explained that it was intended to extend further processing under the European Patent
Convention (in view of the EPC 2000 Revision) to non-compliance with time limits established under that
Convention.106 Accordingly, it was agreed that the International Bureau would revise the corresponding
provisions.

Standing Committee on the Law of Patents
In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the Ô¨Årst
session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Article 13 PLT (‚ÄúExtension of a time limit Ô¨Åxed
by the OfÔ¨Åce‚Äù) was restricted to requests for extension of a time limit Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce for an action in a
procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce prior to the expiration of that time limit.107 Article 13(1) PLT provides for the
extension of a time limit as of right; in particular, the applicant or owner concerned could not be required to
state the grounds on which the request is based.108 Article 14 PLT provides that ‚Äúfurther processing‚Äù of an
application should generally be permitted on the mere basis of a request and the payment of a fee.109 In
contrast to restoration of rights, a Contracting Party would not be permitted to restrict further processing to
those cases in which the failure to comply with the time limit occurred in spite of all due care or was
unintentional, so that there would be no requirement for a declaration or other evidence in this respect.110
Article 15 PLT provides for the restoration of rights in respect of an application or patent following
failure to comply with a time limit for an action before the OfÔ¨Åce. However, restoration would be restricted
to those situations in which the failure of the time limit occurred in spite of all due care required by the
circumstances or was unintentional (Article 15(1)(iii) PLT).111

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
second session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Articles 13, 14, 15 and 16 PLT were
renumbered to become Articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 PLT, respectively.112 In the corresponding ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù the
distinction between Articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 PLT was explained by the International Bureau:113
 Article 10 PLT provides for the extension of a time limit as of right, where the request for such extension

is made before the expiration of that time limit. It is limited to the extension of time limits Ô¨Åxed by the
OfÔ¨Åce for an action in a procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce and is subject only to the payment of a fee.
Accordingly, the applicant or owner concerned could not be required to state the grounds on which the
request under Article 10 PLT is based.114
 In contrast, Articles 11 and 12 PLT apply where the request for relief is made after the expiration of the

time limit concerned. Article 11 PLT provides for the OfÔ¨Åce to consider the time limit to have been

Patent Law Treaty

complied with, and to continue processing and re-instate any rights with respect to the application (or
patent), subject only to the payment of a fee, provided that the request is Ô¨Åled, and the requirements in
respect of which the time limit applied are complied with in due time.115 As in the case of Article 10
PLT, Article 11 PLT is limited to the extension of time limits Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce for an action in a
procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce.

 As in the case of Article 11, Article 12 PLT provides for the re-instatement of rights where the request is

made after the expiration of the time limits concerned. In contrast to Article 11 PLT, Article 12 PLT is
not restricted to time limits Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce but applies to any time limit in respect of which failure to
comply has the direct consequence of causing a loss of rights with respect to the application or patent
concerned.116
 Article 13 PLT provides for the addition of a priority claim (Article 13(1) PLT). In addition, Article 13

PLT provides for the restoration of a priority claim in the case of the delayed Ô¨Åling of the subsequent
application (Article 13(2) PLT) or the failure to furnish a copy of the earlier application within the
prescribed time limit (Article 13(3) PLT). In order to avoid the possibility of double relief, the time
limits referred to in Article 13(1), (2) and (3)(a) PLT are expressly excluded in the exceptions under
Articles 10 to 12 PLT.117,115,116,117

Each of Articles 10 to 13 PLT sets the maximum standard, which a PLT Contracting Party may apply.
A PLT Contracting Party would be permitted, but is not obliged, to dispense with any requirement under
these Articles, or to apply any requirement or provide any relief which, from the viewpoint of applicants,
owners or other interested persons, is more favorable than the requirements or relief prescribed in these
Articles and associated Regulations.118

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
third session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Article 10 PLT (‚Äúrelief in respect of the
non-compliance with a time limit‚Äù) was reformulated to provide for relief in respect of the non-
compliance with a time limit Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce with regard to an application or a patent, without
specifying the form of relief.119 In particular, Article 10 PLT does not distinguish between extensions of
time limits Ô¨Åled after the expiration of the un-extended time limit and remedies like continued processing,
which have the effect to reinstate the rights of the applicant or owner. It only obliges PLT Contracting
Parties to provide for at least one relief for applicants or owners in the case of a missed time limit, subject
only to a request and the payment of a fee.120.

In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù of the third session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, the
basic concept of draft Article 10 PLT providing certain relief without specifying its mechanism was
supported in general.121 However, some delegations preferred to accommodate both requests Ô¨Åled
before and after the expiration of the time limit. Based on the discussion, the International Bureau
presented a revised text of Article 10 PLT for consideration by the Committee, which reads as
follows:122

Article 10(1) (Extension of Time Limits)
A Contracting Party may provide for the extension, for the period prescribed in the Regulations, of a
time limit Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce for an action in a procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce in respect of an application or a
patent, if a request to that effect is made to the OfÔ¨Åce in accordance with the requirements prescribed in
the Regulations, and the request is made, at the option of the Contracting Party:

(a) prior to the expiration of the time limit; or
(b) after the expiration of the time limit, and within the time limit prescribed in the Regulations.

Article 10(2) (Continued Processing)

172

Patent Law Treaty

Cees Mulder

Where an applicant or owner has failed to comply with a time limit Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce of a Contracting
Party for an action in a procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce in respect of an application or a patent, and that
Contracting Party does not provide for extension of a time limit under paragraph (1)(ii), the Contracting
Party shall (notify the applicant or owner, and) provide for continued processing with respect to the
application or patent and, if necessary, re-instatement of the rights of the applicant or owner with respect
to that application or patent, if:

(i) a request to that effect is made to the OfÔ¨Åce in accordance with the requirements prescribed in the

Regulations;

(ii) the request is made, and all of the requirements in respect of which the time limit for the action

concerned applied are complied with, within the time limit prescribed in the Regulations.

The above text of Article 10 PLT is a combination of the earlier Articles 10 and 11 PLT and is already
relatively close to the text adopted during the Diplomatic Conference. As regards Article 10(1) PLT,
several delegations supported the text suggested by the International Bureau; other Representatives were
in favor of replacing ‚Äúmay‚Äù by ‚Äúshall.‚Äù123

Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the PLT
In the Draft Proposal submitted to the Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty
submitted by the Director General of WIPO, Article 10 PLT on ‚ÄúRelief in respect of time limits‚Äù was
renumbered to become Article 11 PLT and Article 13 PLT on ‚ÄúRe-instatement of rights after a Ô¨Ånding of
due care or unintentionality by the OfÔ¨Åce‚Äù was renumbered to become Article 12 PLT.124

During the meetings at the Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty, the
requirements for extension of time limits were extensively discussed. A delegation asked whether a PLT
Contracting Party was obliged to provide for the extension of time limits even though Article 11(1) PLT
was a ‚Äúmay‚Äù provision. A representative of the WIPO referred to Article 11(2) PLT according to which a
PLT Contracting Party that did not provide for the extension of time limits after the expiration of the time
limit (Article 11(1)(ii) PLT), would be obliged to provide for continued processing.125 A representative of
the European Patent Organization said that Article 11(2) PLT was the core provision of the whole Article,
making it mandatory to provide for relief of missed time limits, either in form of an extension of the time
limit requested after its expiry, or through continued processing.126-127

With respect to Article 12 PLT, a Representative of WIPO explained that Article 12 PLT provided for
the re-instatement of rights after a Ô¨Ånding of due care or unintentionally by the OfÔ¨Åce. In contrast to Article
11 PLT, Article 12 PLT was not limited to time limits Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce, but applied to any time limit for
an action in a procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce. It also only dealt with time limits where failure to comply had
the direct consequence of causing loss of rights with respect to an application or patent.128

Conclusion
From the above overview of the negotiations, it can be concluded that Articles 11 and 12 PLT regulate
minimum requirements for relief in respect of time limits and reinstatement of rights. However, the
formulations chosen in Article 11 PLT in relation to extension of time limits and the provision of
continued processing are a typical compromise while accommodating the common practice before the US
Patent and Trademark OfÔ¨Åce (USPTO) and the European Patent OfÔ¨Åce (EPO). The EPO allows extension
of ofÔ¨Åce time limits (see Rule 132 EPC ‚ÄúPeriods speciÔ¨Åed by the European Patent OfÔ¨Åce‚Äù) if requested
before the expiry of the time limit and allows applicants to request continued processing when the time
limit is overrun (see Article 121 and Rule 135 EPC ‚ÄúFurther processing of the European patent
application‚Äù). On the other hand, the USPTO allows applicants to request extension of time limits after

173

Cees Mulder

Patent Law Treaty

expiry of the time limit. Both options were accommodated in the PLT by inserting the formulation ‚Äúmay
require‚Äù into Article 11(1) PLT. Article 11(2) PLT contains a ‚Äúshall,‚Äù but this comes into effect only if the
‚Äúmay require‚Äù extension of time limits after expiry of the time limit (Article 11(1)(ii) PLT) is not provided
in the national law.

Article 12 PLT is also a compromise because no choice was made between whether and, if so,
how much argumentation is required upon requesting re-instatement of rights. For a request for re-
instatement to be successful, the EPO requires that the applicant for or proprietor of a European patent
proves ‚Äúall due care required by the circumstance‚Äù (see Article 122 and Rule 136 EPC ‚ÄúRe-establishment
of rights‚Äù) whereas before the USPTO it is sufÔ¨Åcient that the delay was ‚Äúunintentional.‚Äù Again this
introduces too much freedom for PLT Contracting Parties when implementing requirements of the PLT
into their national and regional patent laws and is contrary to the aim of harmonization and streamlining of
the PLT.

Restoration of Priority Right

Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty
In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the Ô¨Årst
session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, there was no article on restoration of the
priority right.129 In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts, a number of delegations favored,
amongst other things, the inclusion in the PLT of provisions relating to restoration of rights.130

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at
the third session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, there was a new Article 13
PLT ‚ÄúBelated claiming of priority‚Äù.131 This provision was modeled after Article 7 of the Basic
Proposal submitted to the 1991 Diplomatic Conference in relation to the ‚ÄúPatent Harmonization
Treaty‚Äù.132

Article 13(1) PLT addresses the situation in which an application which could claim the priority of an
earlier application does not, when Ô¨Åled, contain such a claim. The paragraph allows the claiming of
priority in a separate declaration Ô¨Åled later than the application. This is permissible since the Paris
Convention does not require that the priority claim (‚Äúthe declaration‚Äù containing the priority claim,
according to the terminology of Article 4D(1) of that Convention) be contained in the subsequent
application itself.133 Article 13(2) PLT provides for the restoration of the priority right where a subsequent
application is Ô¨Åled after, but within 2 months from, the date on which the priority period expired. It applies
only where the failure to Ô¨Åle the application within the priority period occurred in spite of all due care
required by the circumstances having been taken.134

In the meantime, the WIPO General Assembly and the Assembly of the Paris Union (meeting in
September/October 1996) considering a Memorandum by the Director General in respect of Matters
Concerning the Patent Law Treaty, decided, amongst others, to include provisions relating to the belated
claiming of priority (delayed submission of priority claim and delayed Ô¨Åling of the subsequent
application) in the draft PLT.135

In the subsequent ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by the Committee of Experts, the basic concept of draft Article 13

PLT was supported in general.136

In the fourth session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, Article 13 PLT on
‚ÄúBelated claiming of priority‚Äù was renumbered to become Article 15 PLT.137 In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù adopted by
the Committee of Experts, the delegation of France asked whether, under Article 15(2)(a) PLT, the
priority period would be extended to 14 months or would remain a 12-month period subject to possible
restoration and, in the latter case, whether third party rights would be recognized.138 The International
Bureau replied that the priority period would remain a 12-month period and that third party rights would
not be recognized in case of restoration.

Cees Mulder

In the Ô¨Åfth session of the Committee of Experts on the Patent Law Treaty, the title of Article 15 PLT
was amended to become: ‚ÄúAddition and restoration of priority claim.‚Äù139 As before, Article 15(1) PLT
addresses the situation in which an application which could claim the priority of an earlier application does
not, when Ô¨Åled, contain such a priority claim.140 Article 15(2) PLT provides for the restoration of the
priority right where a subsequent application is Ô¨Åled after, but within 2 months, from the expiration of the
priority period. It was noted again that the priority period, namely the 12-month period under Article 4C(1)
of the Paris Convention, would not be extended.141 Article 15(3) PLT provides a remedy for the applicant
where his right of priority is lost because of the failure on the part of the OfÔ¨Åce with which the earlier
application was Ô¨Åled to provide a copy of that application in time for the applicant to comply with the
prescribed time limit, despite a timely request for that copy having been made.142 A new paragraph (5) was
added to Article 15 PLT allowing a PLT Contracting Party to levy a fee in relation to Article 15(1), (2) or
(3) PLT to be paid to its OfÔ¨Åce.

Standing Committee on the Law of Patents
In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the Ô¨Årst
session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Article 15 PLT on ‚ÄúAddition and restoration of
priority claim‚Äù was renumbered to become Article 16 PLT.143

Article 16(1) PLT in relation of the addition of a priority claim is modeled after a portion of PCT Rule
26bis.1.144,145 Article 16(2) PLT in relation to restoration of the priority was amended to include that the
failure to furnish that application within the priority period occurred either in spite of all due care required
by the circumstances having been taken, or, at
the option of the PLT Contracting Party, was
unintentional.146

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
second session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, Article 16 PLT was renumbered to
become Article 13 PLT. In the corresponding ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù the scope of Articles 13 PLT in relation to Articles
10-12 PLT was explained by the International Bureau (also see Standing Committee on the Law of Patents
Section): Article 13 PLT provides for the addition of a priority claim (Article 13(1) PLT). In addition,
Article 13 PLT provides for the restoration of a priority claim in the case of the delayed Ô¨Åling of the
subsequent application (Article 13(2) PLT) or the failure to furnish a copy of the earlier application within
the prescribed time limit (Article 13(3) PLT).

In the ‚ÄúDraft PLT and Draft Regulations‚Äù prepared by the International Bureau and presented at the
third session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, there were only minor amendment to Article
13 PLT on ‚ÄúCorrection, addition or restoration of priority claim.‚Äù147 Later on, the title was amended to read:
‚ÄúCorrection or addition of priority claim; restoration of priority right.‚Äù148 In the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù of the third
session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents, only minor amendments were proposed and
adopted. Amongst others, the word ‚Äúmay‚Äù in the chapeau of Article 13(1) PLT was changed into ‚Äúshall.‚Äù149

Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the PLT
With respect to Article 13 PLT in the Draft Proposal submitted to the Diplomatic Conference for the
Adoption of the Patent Law Treaty submitted by the Director General of WIPO, a representative of the
WIPO explained Article 13 PLT comprised three provisions relating to priority claims, all of which were
intended to be very user-friendly.150,151 The remedy of Article 13(1) PLT already existed under the PCT in
Rule 26bis.1. With respect to Article 13(2) PLT, the Representative of WIPO explained that this paragraph
provided for the restoration of the priority right where the application claiming priority was not received
by the OfÔ¨Åce until after the expiration of the 12-month priority period. It did not provide for an extension
of the priority period provided for under the Paris Convention and the provision would apply only after the
expiration of that period.152

Patent Law Treaty

With respect to Article 13(3) PLT, the Representative of WIPO noted that it was intended to address
the situation where the applicant requested a copy of the earlier application on which the priority claim
was based, but as a result of delays in the OfÔ¨Åce with which the earlier application had been Ô¨Åled, he did not
receive it in time to comply with the period for Ô¨Åling that application, which was typically 16 months.153

Conclusion
From the above overview of the negotiations, it can be concluded that Article 13 PLT regulates minimum
requirements for the correction or addition of a priority claim (Article 13(1) PLT), the restoration of a
priority claim in the case of the delayed Ô¨Åling of the subsequent application (Article 13(2) PLT) or the
failure to furnish a copy of the earlier application within the prescribed time limit (Article 13(3) PLT).
Article 13(1) PLT was copied into the PLT based on PCT Rule 26bis.1 which functions well.
However, Article 13(2) PLT is again (see Conclusion in Restoration of Priority Right Section) a
compromise between different viewpoints of the delegations, because no choice was made between
whether and, if so, how much argumentation is required upon requesting restoration of the priority right.
For a request for restoration to be successful, the EPO requires that the applicant for or proprietor of a
European patent proves all due care required by the circumstance whereas before the USPTO it is
sufÔ¨Åcient that the delay was unintentional. Again this introduces too much freedom for PLT Contracting
Parties when implementing requirements of the PLT into their national and regional patent laws and is
contrary to the aim of harmonization and streamlining of the PLT.

Guidance by WIPO
The WIPO is a specialized agency of the United Nations.154 It is dedicated to developing a balanced and
accessible international intellectual property system.155

During the negotiation process of the PLT, the WIPO played an active role by preparing the draft texts
of the PLT and its Regulations, looking for compromises and seeking political agreement between the
interests of the various States.

As the conclusion of the PLT, the involvement of the WIPO has diminished, because there are no
centralized functions. The International Bureau of WIPO merely acts as depository of the PLT and is not in
a position to give an ofÔ¨Åcial interpretation of the Treaty; as such interpretation is the exclusive competence
of the PLT Contracting Parties.

The International Bureau has issued a set of Explanatory Notes on the PLT and Regulations under the
PLT; the Notes have not been adopted by the Diplomatic Conference.156 These Notes are helpful in
understanding the meaning of the PLT. However, these texts are based on the Notes prepared by the
International Bureau of WIPO in preparation for the meetings of the Committee of Experts on the Patent
Law Treaty and the SCP, which are sometimes difÔ¨Åcult to understand, if one has not followed the
developments during the negotiation process.

In order to stimulate the electronic distribution of draft modiÔ¨Åcations in the Treaty and the submission
of comments and observations, a PLT Web Forum was established following a decision of the PLT
Assembly at its Ô¨Årst session.157,158 The PLT Web Forum is intended to be used for consultations prior to the
meetings of the PLT Assembly.159

As the PLT is a mix of compulsory requirements (‚Äúshall‚Äù) and optional requirements which may
be implemented as compulsory (‚Äúmay require‚Äù) by a PLT Contracting Party, a lot of choices need be
made when implementing the PLT into the national/regional patent law of an aspirant PLT Contracting
Party.160

In 2010 a Questionnaire was established and placed on the PLT Web Forum to collect information
from the PLT Contracting Parties on how the PLT is implemented at the national/regional level, and to

176

Patent Law Treaty

Cees Mulder

share such information with current and future PLT Contracting Parties, as well as with patent
practitioners and the public.161 The Questionnaire encompasses eleven categories of questions, amongst
which are the following ones:

 Question 1 - Filing date (Article 5 and Rule 2 PLT);
 Question 4 - Relief in respect of time limits (Article 11 and Rule 12 PLT);
 Question 5 - Reinstatement of Rights (Article 12 and Rule 13 PLT);
 Question 6 - Restoration of priority rights where the Ô¨Åling of the subsequent application was delayed
 Question 7 - Restoration of priority rights where the Ô¨Åling of a copy of the earlier application was

(Article 13(2) and Rule 14(4) and (5) PLT);

delayed (Article 13(3) and Rule 14(6) PLT).

Most of these Questions are split into a number of sub-questions. By way of example, three of the six

sub-questions of Question 1 read as follows:

Q1-2

Q1-5

Q1-6

Does your Office accept a drawing as the element referred to as ‚Äúa part which on the face of it
appears to be a description‚Äù in Article 5(1)(a)(iii) PLT? (Reference: Article 5(1)(b) PLT).
For the filing date to be determined under Article 5(6)(b) PLT (filing of a missing part of the
description or a missing drawing), which of the optional elements referred to in Rule 2(4) PLT
are required by your Office? (Reference: Rule 2(4) PLT).
For a reference to a previously filed application to replace the description and any drawing for
the purpose of the filing date under Article 5(7) PLT, which of the requirements referred to in
Rule 2(5) PLT are required by your Office? (Reference: Rule 2(5) PLT)

A number of PLT Contracting Parties have posted answers to the Questionnaire.162 From the
responses a large variety of choices can be observed. With respect to Q1-2 (Is a ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù accepted as a
‚Äúdescription?‚Äù), 10 PLT Contracting Parties answered ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù 14 ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and one Party answered: ‚ÄúThis is
something we would consider on a case by case basis if and when it arose.‚Äù 163

With respect to Q1-5 (‚ÄúÔ¨Åling missing parts of the description or missing drawings‚Äù) six sub-questions
have to be answered in relation to ‚Äúwhich of the optional elements referred to in PLT Rule 2(4) are
required by your OfÔ¨Åce?‚Äù. 164

Question Q1-5

(a) A copy of the earlier application
(b) A copy of the earlier application and its filing date, certified as correct
(c) A translation of the earlier application
(d) The missing part of the description or missing drawing must be completely

contained in the earlier application

(e) The application must contain an indication that the contents of the earlier

application were incorporated by reference

(f) An indication as to where the missing part of the description or the missing

drawing is contained in the earlier application or in the translation

From the above comparison, it can be concluded that when a country considers becoming a
Contracting Party to the PLT, studying the responses to the Questionnaire is not very helpful in making
choices.

When asked, the WIPO provides assistance to an aspirant PLT Contracting Party. This assistance is
given bilaterally on a case-by-case basis, depending on the circumstances of the country concerned.
Example texts can be employed as a guidance on how the requirements of the PLT can be implemented in
the national/regional law. However, these texts have no ofÔ¨Åcial status.

Two examples are given here. The Ô¨Årst example of a textual suggestion relates to the requirements for
the accordance of a Ô¨Åling date (Article 5 PLT). Such an Article could be formulated in the national law as
follows:166

‚ÄúFiling date of the Application

1. The accordance of the Ô¨Åling date of an application shall require that on such a date the application

Ô¨Åled with the Institution contains:

(a) an express indication that the grant of a patent is applied for;
(b) information identifying the applicant or allowing the applicant to be contacted; and
(c) a part which on the face of it appears to be a description, or reference to a previously Ô¨Åled

application.

2. A reference to a previously Ô¨Åled application under paragraph 1(c) shall state the Ô¨Åling date and
number of that application and the OfÔ¨Åce with which that application was Ô¨Åled. The reference shall
indicate that it replaces the description for the purpose of the Ô¨Åling date.

3. Where the application contains a reference under paragraph 2, a copy of the previously Ô¨Åled
application shall be Ô¨Åled within two months from the date on which the application containing the
reference was received by the Institute. Where the previously Ô¨Åled application is not in one of the
ofÔ¨Åcial languages of (), a translation thereof shall be Ô¨Åled within the same period.‚Äù

The second example relates to the remedy of ‚Äúcontinued processing.‚Äù With respect to providing
relieve in respect of time limits, a PLT Contracting Party may provide for the extension of a time limit
Ô¨Åxed by the OfÔ¨Åce for an action in a procedure before the OfÔ¨Åce, if a request to that effect is made to the
OfÔ¨Åce in accordance with the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, and the request is Ô¨Åled, at the
option of the Contracting Party either prior to the expiration of the time limit, or after the expiration of the
time limit (Article 11(1) and Rule 12(1) PLT). In principle, the PLT does not oblige a PLT Contracting
Party to impose continued processing. However, the relief is mandatory if it is not allowed to Ô¨Åle the
request for an extension of a time limit after the expiration of the time limit (Article 11(2) and Rule 12(3)
and (4) PLT). This implies that if a PLT Contracting Party chooses that the request for the extension of the
time limit can only be Ô¨Åled before the expiration thereof, providing continued processing is mandatory, but

178

¬© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
The Journal of World Intellectual Property (2014) Vol. 17, no. 5‚Äì6

Patent Law Treaty

Cees Mulder

if a giving country allows that the request for extension can be Ô¨Åled after the expired time limit (but within
a certain period of time; Rule 12(2)(b) PLT), there is no need providing for continued processing
provisions. On the other hand, if the national law of a PLT Contracting Party (already) has a provision on
continued processing, it is not mandatory to provide for the extension of time limits (see the wording ‚Äúmay
provide for the extension‚Äù in the chapeau of Article 11(1) PLT).

A textual suggestion in relation to providing ‚Äúcontinued processing‚Äù in the patent law of a PLT

Contracting Party reads as follows:

1) If the applicant for a patent has failed to perform an act in the course of the procedure before the
Institute within a time limit prescribed by this Law (or the Regulations), the direct result of which is a
loss of rights conferred by a patent application, he may Ô¨Åle a request for the continued processing. The
Institute shall allow the continued processing, provided that the applicant:

(a) Ô¨Åles a request for the continued processing, and performs all the omitted acts within a time limit

referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article;

(b) pays the fee and procedural charges in accordance with Article () of this Law.

2) A time limit for Ô¨Åling a request and for the performance of the omitted acts referred to in paragraph 1

of this Article shall be two months from the notiÔ¨Åcation to the applicant or holder of a patent.

3) If the omitted acts have not been performed within a time limit referred to in paragraph 2 of this
Article, or if the fees and procedural charges referred to in Article () of this Law have not been paid, a
request for the continued processing shall be considered as not Ô¨Åled, and the Institute shall issue a
conclusion to that effect.

4) A request for the continued processing shall not be Ô¨Åled in the case of failure to comply with a time

limit:

(a) referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article,
(b) (‚Ä¶)
(c) for performing all the acts in the appeal procedure,
(d) for actions in inter partes proceedings.

5) The content of the request, the conditions and the procedure concerning the request referred to in

paragraph 1 of this Article shall be regulated more speciÔ¨Åcally by the Implementing Regulations.

An aspirant PLT Contracting Party is, of course, entirely free to make its own choices when
implementing the PLT in its national/regional patent law. Nevertheless, it is believed that such textual
suggestions are very helpful in understanding and illustrating the scope of the PLT and would stimulate a
more uniform implementation of the PLT in national/regional patent laws. A more active role of the WIPO
would be welcomed in this respect.

Discussion

Since the continuation of the 1991 Diplomatic Conference in The Hague on the harmonization of the
substantive provisions of patent laws had become impossible in view of the position taken by the
delegation of the United States of America,167 the WIPO incited new negotiations in 1995 which
eventually resulted in the adoption of the PLT during a Diplomatic Conference held in Geneva in 2000.
The resulting PLT focuses on the harmonization of patent formalities with the aim of stimulating
uniformity, simpliÔ¨Åcation and cost reduction within the international patent system.

During the negotiation process, a number of provisions in the PLT were modeled after texts of
Articles already contained in the Basic Proposal submitted to the 1991 Diplomatic Conference in relation
to the ‚ÄúPatent Harmonization Treaty.‚Äù168 In addition, many proposals to amend the Draft Articles and

¬© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
The Journal of World Intellectual Property (2014) Vol. 17, no. 5‚Äì6

179

Cees Mulder

Patent Law Treaty

Draft Regulations under the PLT were brought forward by the delegations in order to accommodate the
local practice in their home countries. If no agreement could be reached on the implementation of such a
requirement, often the desired amendment was incorporated in the PLT but without prescribing that this
was mandatory. As a consequence, the PLT contains a mix of compulsory requirements (‚Äúshall‚Äù) and
optional requirements which may be implemented as compulsory (‚Äúmay require‚Äù) by a PLT Contracting
Party. Such diversity of requirements is counterproductive with respect to achieving the goal of the PLT to
‚Äústreamline and harmonize‚Äù formal requirements set by national and regional Patent OfÔ¨Åces for the Ô¨Åling
of national or regional patent applications,
the maintenance of patents and certain additional
requirements.169

From studying the documents relating to the negotiation history of the PLT, it can be inferred that the
role of the WIPO in the negotiation process resulting in the PLT was more of a facilitating nature than
aimed at obtaining a Treaty that encompasses mainly compulsory requirements. The inclusion of optional
requirements should only have been allowed in a limited number of exceptional cases. On the other hand,
it can be understood that the desire to reach an agreement on a PLT often made it necessary to bridge
differences; this was not always possible, and this is one of the reasons why there are so many alternative
routes in the PLT.

By allowing too much freedom in relation to the fundamental requirements of the PLT has resulted in
a fallible Treaty. This conclusion becomes the more evident from studying the answers posted by a
number of PLT Contracting Parties to the Questionnaire on the PLT Web Forum.170 The large variety of
choices deÔ¨Åes any striving to ‚Äústreamline and harmonize‚Äù formal requirements.

In principle, there are two ways in solving these fundamental problems of the PLT. One option to
make the PLT more coherent is to amend the Treaty in a comprehensive manner. As a Ô¨Årst step, the
Regulations under the PLT could be made more restrictive by deleting the majority of the ‚Äúmay require‚Äù
formulations and/or by reformulating them into obligatory (‚Äúshall‚Äù) requirements. Amending the PLT
Rules does not require a Revision Conference. Whether consensus can be reached on these amendments is
questionable, in particular, because a number of PLT Contracting Parties has already amended their
national or regional law in view of the PLT as concluded in 2000.

Another option would be to re-open negotiations in relation to the ‚ÄúTreaty Supplementing the Paris
Convention as far as Patents are Concerned.‚Äù This could work because the objections by one of the major
Contracting Parties have recently been overcome.171-172

By not changing anything in the PLT, the Contracting Parties will continue to implement the PLT into
their national law. This will result in less harmonization and streamlining in patent laws than before the
adoption of the PLT.

Conclusion

When the PLT was negotiated in the nineties of the previous century, the emphasis was on making the
Ô¨Åling of a patent application as simple and user-friendly as possible. Inventors and small business
enterprises were afforded easy access to Ô¨Åling a patent application. The requirements for the accordance of
a Ô¨Åling date were reduced to an absolute minimum, rendering it practically impossible to miss this date. As
a consequence, procedures had to be put in place at the (receiving) OfÔ¨Åces allowing the applicant to meet
additional requirements (such as furnishing a set of claims) at a later stage. All this laid a heavy
administrative burden on the OfÔ¨Åces which have to deal with such applications.

In the present time, the focus of the national OfÔ¨Åces and intergovernmental organizations dealing with
national and regional patent applications, is moving away from the needs of the applicants to issues such as
how to deal with huge numbers of patent applications in a more efÔ¨Åcient manner. Therefore, the
procedural requirements of the PLT are regarded as counterproductive to achieving that objective.

Perhaps this is also one of the reasons why accession to the PLT of countries and intergovernmental
organizations, such as the European Patent Organization, takes place at a slow pace.173

In view of the above, the following conclusions can be formulated:

(1) The PLT did not achieve the goal of streamlining and harmonizing formal requirements set by
national or regional Patent OfÔ¨Åces for the Ô¨Åling of national or regional patent applications and the
maintenance of patents.

(2) The PLT contains too many optional requirements, which may be implemented as compulsory (‚Äúmay
require‚Äù) by PLT Contracting Parties, allowing them too much freedom when implementing
requirements of the PLT into their national and regional patent laws. This deÔ¨Åes the aim of
harmonization and streamlining of the PLT. A solution to make the PLT more coherent would be to
amend the PLT Rules in making them more restrictive.

(3) The WIPO could play a more active role in issuing instructions and guidelines on how to implement
the PLT in national and regional patent laws. A preferred manner of implementing the PLT could be
advocated.

(4) The provision in the PLT allowing an applicant to Ô¨Åle a missing part of the description or a missing
drawing based on content which is ‚Äúcompletely contained‚Äù in an earlier application from which
priority is claimed, while maintaining the originally accorded Ô¨Åling date, is a powerful tool because it
permits an applicant to complete his application without losing his priority claim.

(5) The obligation of a PLT Contracting State to provide for relief in respect of time limits either by means
of providing an extension of the time limit or by providing continued processing is one of the major
achievements of the PLT.

(6) The obligation of a PLT Contracting State to provide for restoration of priority rights is a powerful
instrument to rectify mistakes in relation to priority claims allowing applicants to counteract the
unintentional loss of such rights.
