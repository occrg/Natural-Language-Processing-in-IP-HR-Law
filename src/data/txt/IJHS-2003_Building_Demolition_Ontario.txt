Lost Heritage: a  survey of historic 
building demolitions in Ontario, Canada 
Robert  Shipley and Karen  Reyburn 

Abstract 
There  has been legislation  in place since the  1970s in Canada's largest province,  Ontario, 
that encourages the identification of significant heritage buildings and is supposed to provide 
them with at least a degree of protection.  Both heritage recognition and most other land use 
decisions,  however,  are  exercised  at  the  local  government  level.  W'hile  conservation  of 
heritage structures  has been  successful in some places,  an  alarming number of significant 
historic buildings in  the province continue to  be  lost.  Relying on  dozens of volunteers,  this 
study examined thousands of buildings in over twenty Ontario communities and sought to 
establish  how  many heritage  buildings  had been  demolished  and to  determine  why  these 
losses  were  occurring.  It  was  discovered  that  in  the  municipalities  surveyed  over  400 
historically recognised buildings had been lost in the last sixteen years.  Recommendations for 
how  to  deal with this problem  are  included in  the  study.

In  recent  years  there  has  been  widespread  concern  about  the  demolition  of 
buildings, which are not only part of the heritage of Ontario, Canada's largest and 
wealthiest  province,  but  which  could  also  be  strong  financial  assets  for  their 
owners. 1 The Ontario Heritage Act was proclaimed in 1975 as Ontario's response to 
a  worldwide  effort  aimed  at  preserving for  future  generations  'not only  ... great 
works  of art  but  also  . . .  more  modest  works  of the  past  which  have  acquired 
cultural significance with the passing of time .. .'Those are words from UNESCO's 
~nice Charter,  to  which  Canada was  a  signatory in  1964. The ~nice Charter also 
states  that,  'it  is  the  duty  of  governments  to  ensure  the  protection  and  the

preservation of the cultural heritage of [humanity) as much as to promote social and 
economic development'. 

Under the Ontario Heritage Act it is  possible, but not mandatory, for municipal 
governments  (local  authorities)  to  recognise  the  significance  of certain  buildings 
within their communities. Through a process  referred to  as  'heritage designation', 
historic buildings are given  a measure of protection against unsympathetic change 
or destruction. Designation can be applied to individual buildings as well as groups 
of buildings  within  districts.  Plans  for  proposed  changes  must be  reviewed  by  a 
citizen panel, but in the final analysis an owner may demolish a designated building 
after  a  waiting period.  In addition  to  the  official  designation,  many  communities 
prepare lists of other significant buildings. These 'wish lists' identify properties that 
could be designated but are not. This is generally due to lack of funds to support the 
municipal  staff who  would  complete  the  work,  or  because  the  property  owners 
object  to  designation,  fearing  loss  of private  property  rights.  These  conservation 
measures are weak by European standards but are comparable to other 'new world' 
legislation. 

To  confront  the  concern  about  the  loss  of heritage  buildings  in  spite  of the 
conservation  legislation,  three  partner organisations  came  together-Community 
Heritage  Ontario  (CHO),  the  Ontario  Heritage  Foundation  (OHF)  and  the 
Architectural  Conservancy  of Ontario  (ACO).  Local  Architectural  Conservation 
Advisory Committees (l.ACACs), which are represented provincially by CHO, the 
OHF  (an  arm's-length  agency  of the  Ontario  government)  and  the  Ministry  of 
Culture,  are  involved  in  implementing  the  province's  heritage  policies.  l.ACACs 
(citizen panels) advise local councils on heritage matters within their jurisdictions. 
The  OHF  is  empowered  by  the  Heritage  Act  to  own  built  and  natural  heritage 
properties,  to  enter  into  easement  agreements,  and  to  support,  encourage  and 
facilitate the conservation, protection and preservation of the heritage  of Ontario. 
The Ministry of Culture oversees heritage and cultural affairs  but, as  with  similar 
agencies throughout the world,  it is  generally understaffed and under funded. The 
ACO, which has been active in architectural conservation since  1933, is a volunteer 
organisation involved in preservation. To  assist with this effort,  the partner groups 
sought funding from the Trillium Foundation, which distributes lottery proceeds in 
Ontario, and engaged the assistance of the School of Planning at the University of 
Waterloo. 

Need for Research 
In 1999 the Department of Canadian Heritage conducted a study that reviewed the 
status  of  buildings  recorded  in  the  Canadian  Inventory  of  Historic  Buildings 
(CIHB). 2  To  date,  the  CIHB  is  the  most  complete  inventory  of built  heritage 
resources  in  Canada. The  CIHB was  intended  to  be  a  record  of all  buildings  in 
Canada built before 1914, not just those identified as historically or architecturally

significant.  Collection of the majority of the data for  the CIHB occurred between 
1960 and 1980 and, as a result, the data are tied to a twenty-five- to thirty-year time 
span. The 1999 report chose a random sample of CIHB buildings in ten Canadian 
areas,  to  assess  changes that had occurred since  the original  recording.  From this 
sampling of the CIHB it was found that 21% of the buildings in the study had been 
demolished and  14% experienced substantial alteration resulting in  a  total loss  of 
their historical character. 

With  the  exception  of the  1999  study  there  has  been  little  or  no  systematic 
research collecting reliable and defensible information about lost heritage buildings 
in Canada. 3  Such statistics are needed to replace anecdotal information, which can 
be selective depending upon one's point of view.  Since the designation process falls 
within  local  municipal  jurisdiction,  it is  important to  provide  information  that is 
pertinent  to  these  communities.  Although  some  municipalities  are  aware  of the 
number of losses of designated buildings in their jurisdiction, most do not know the 
number of undesignated but historically  significant  buildings  that have  been lost. 
This information is  now helping local  groups in their efforts  to save  buildings.  In 
addition,  it  will  give  them  a  better understanding  of how  designation  and listing 
affects  the future  of buildings. 

Scope and Approach 
Until now,  the knowledge  of lost heritage buildings in Ontario has been primarily 
anecdotal or has been limited to buildings designated under the Ontario Heritage 
Act  where  the  municipality  in  question  has  kept  a  record  of  lost  designated 
buildings.  This  study  concentrated  on  collecting  information  on  buildings  in 
participating communities that have been recognised as  significant in some official 
manner, whether by designation, a municipal or LACAC list, a plaque, inclusion in 
an  architectural  study,  noted  in  architectural  tours  or in  some  other  recognised 
manner. The  main  focus  of this  study was  to  determine  how  many buildings  in 
Ontario have been lost since  1985. The date was  chosen in order to be within the 
reliable  memory  of the  volunteers  conducting  the  research.  A  number of related 
questions, such as  what kinds  of buildings are being lost  and the reasons for their 
loss,  were  also considered. 

Participation in this  study was  sought from  a  wide  variety of communities with 
regard to the size, character and geographical spread in order to establish a sample 
that was broadly representative of all regions of the province. In the end, twenty-two 
communities  joined in  the study,  ranging in size  from  the former City ofToronto 
(population  653, 734)  through  medium-sized  cities  such  as  London  (330,258), 
Kitchener  (178,420)  and  North  Bay  (54,332)  down  to  small  towns  and  rural 
townships  such  as  Port  Hope  (11,698)  and  Mississippi  Mills  (10,700).  The

municipalities  involved  represent  a  combined  population  of 2, 782,729  or  about 
25.9% of the province's population. The communities also represented a range from 
the very urban, such as  Mississauga, to the primarily rural, such as Brockton. The 
geographical  spread  covers  places  from  the south-west  corner  of the  province  at 
Windsor to Sault Ste Marie in the north. 

Data were  collected for  a  number of different  types  of buildings. The building 
types  included  residences,  commercial  buildings,  industrial  buildings,  places  of 
worship,  and public buildings. The buildings must have been 'recognised' in some 
official  or systematic  manner.  In order to  make data collection and analysis  more 
efficient,  buildings were  divided as  follows: 

•  Category  1 (buildings designated under the  Ontario Heritage Act); 
•  Category  2  (listed  buildings-on  a  recognised  list  held  by  a  municipality, 

LACAC or similar body); 

•  Category 3  (buildings with a plaque); 
•  Category 4  (buildings included in an architectural or other study);4 
•  Category 5  (buildings in an historical publication such as  a town history); 
•  Category 6  (buildings included in a walking tour or similar publication). 

Information gathering 
Information required for the study was gathered by volunteers. Training workshops 
were organised in different places, were typically less than two hours in duration and 
provided  a  step-by-step  set of instructions  for  the volunteers  to  follow. They also 
provided  an  opportunity for  volunteers  to  question  the  research  methodology  in 
order to ensure that they were fully  comfortable with the work being requested of 
them.  A  second  goal  of the  workshops  was  to  allow  face-to-face  communication 
amongst architectural conservationists from across the province. This project would 
not have been possible without the expertise and dedication of volunteers. 

Steps Followed 
The first  step in the research process  was  for  volunteers  to  decide  the  amount of 
time they were able to commit to data collection, as this would determine how many 
categories  they would  research.  All  volunteers  were  asked to research  Category  1 
(designated)  properties. The  first  step  then  was  to  obtain  a  list  of all  designated 
properties  for  a  given  community.  The  lists  contained  the  addresses  of  the 
designated properties as  well  as  the year of designation for each. 

The second step was to discover how many buildings on the Category 1 list had 
been lost. This step  of the process involved  site visits  and,  in some cases,  a  time 
consuming search through old demolition permits in city archives.  In some places, 
the  city  had  kept  records  of lost  designated  buildings.  Volunteers  also  gathered 
information on the date and cause of loss.

If volunteers chose to research other categories such as historically or architectu 
rally  significant  but  not  designated  buildings  (Category  2)  or  buildings  with 
historical  plaques  (Category  3),  they  followed  a  similar  process. Volunteers  were 
instructed to include buildings only in the category of highest recognition-that is 
if a building was designated, volunteers only counted it as  a building in Category 1 
even if it fell  in subsequent categories. This avoided double-counting. 

Once the lists  of buildings were  established, volunteers had to find sources  that 
would inform them about the losses. It was determined that city demolition permits 
would be the most convenient source for information regarding the precise date and 
place since municipalities usually keep these records listed by street address. Most 
volunteers  started their research  on losses  by  accessing  their  own  memories  and 
then moved on to search the demolition permits. In some cases, cities did not keep 
demolition permits back to  1985 and volunteers then had to visit some sites to find 
out if they were  lost or altered. 

While volunteers gained information on the date of loss from their memories and 
demolition permits,  they also  collected details  on the cause of loss  and any other 
relevant  information  relating  to  loss  and  submitted  this  information  with  their 
data. 

Limitations of the Research 
Only buildings lost since 1985 have been included in this study. As information was 
collected  by  volunteers  who  have  been  involved  in  architectural  conservation, 
significant emphasis was put on accessing their own memory. Most volunteers could 
easily recall back to the mid-1980s but further back than that proved more difficult, 
resulting in less  reliable information. 

At  times,  data  collection  was  difficult.  An  example  is  the  fact  that  some 
communities  have  no designated  buildings  while  some  places  have  only  recently 
begun the process so there were very few records on which to draw. The provisions 
in the Heritage Act that enable municipalities to designate properties are applied in 
different ways, depending on local decisions.  In addition,  there appear to be great 
variances in the ways that properties qualify for listing. Inconsistencies may exist in 
the data, as not all communities submitted information on the same categories (see 
table  1). 

Findings 
Overall Loss of Heritage Buildings 
Approximately 14,000 properties in twenty-two communities were investigated for 
this  study. These municipalities  represent approximately one quarter of Ontario's 
population.  Overall it was found that since  1985, 433 historic buildings have been 
lost  in  those  twenty-two  communities  (see  table  2). The  communities  that  have 
experienced the  greatest  rate  of loss,  Richmond  Hill  (19%),  Scarborough  (15%) 
and  Mississauga  (9%),  have  all  experienced  considerable  growth  as  well.  Among 
these  places,  however,  there  are  significant  differences.  Richmond  Hill  has 
experienced  the  highest  rate  of loss  and  also  the  highest  number  of buildings

had been energetic in the past in identifying its historic properties. 

Toronto, on the other hand, seems to have been quite successful in saving heritage 
buildings but a question arises about whether the community has done an adequate 
job in identifying its significant structures. Toronto no longer designates buildings 
unless they are threatened and has not listed large numbers of potentially significant 
buildings.  Fergus,  Sault Ste Marie,  Brant County,  and North Bay  appear to have 
had the most success in preserving their heritage buildings.  Sault Ste Marie, Brant

County and North Bay have recorded no lost heritage buildings. Niagara Falls, and 
Windsor have  each  lost  6%  of their  heritage  buildings. These  are  medium-sized 
cities with some growth pressure but do not match the growth rate of Mississauga, 
Richmond Hill or Scarborough. Windsor and Niagara Falls are both border towns 
that,  unlike  other  communities  in  this  study,  have  experienced  downtown 
development. This is  due in part to new casinos in both cities. 

Apparent Deceleration in Rate of Loss Compared with Previous 
Period 
The percentage of loss per year, as determined in this study (see table 3), indicates 
an apparent  deceleration  in  the  percentage  of loss  of historic  buildings  since  the 
Canadian Inventory of Historic Buildings  (CIHB) was revisited in the  1999 study. 
The buildings examined in this present study were recorded after  1975, when the 
Heritage Act  came  into  affect  and created a  designation  and  listing process. The 
CIHB buildings were recorded between  1960 and  1980.

Table  3  shows  the  percentage  of  loss  of  heritage  buildings  occurring  per  year 
overall  as  recorded  by  these  two  studies- an  annualised  figure. This  figure  was 
reached  by  dividing  the  number  of  years  covered  by  the  study  by  the  total 
percentage of loss.  It should  be remembered  that the CIHB attempted  to record all 
buildings  built before  a  certain  date,  while  the  current study has  focused  only  on 
buildings with som e formal degree of heritage recognition. H owever, the two studies 
are the only ones we have  on which  to base any comparison . There are at least three 
ways  to  interpret this  comparison:

•  legislation,  protection  and/or  awareness  of historic  buildings  has  led  to  more 

effectiveness in heritage conservation; 

•  many  older  buildings,  such  as  those  that  make  up  significant  commercial 
streetscapes, are often not designated or listed and were not recorded as  part of 
the current study; 

•  such a large number of buildings were lost before  1985  (the cut-off date for this 

study) that we  had many fewer  historic buildings to lose. 5 

The correct reading may involve some combination of the above.  Even if only half 
of the CIHB Revisited sample were used, the loss rate per year would be 0.6%, still 
higher than the loss rate per year found by this study and thus illustrating a definite 
deceleration. 

Building Losses: large versus small communities 
Communities with a population over 25,000 had a total loss rate for their recorded 
buildings of over 3%, while communities with a population less than 25,000 had a 
total loss rate for their recorded buildings of less than 2%  (see table 4). Orangeville 
has  a  much  higher  percentage  of loss  than  the  other  small  communities  but  is 
beginning to  feel  considerable  growth  pressure.  Large  communities  have  a  lower 
rate  of loss  for  residences  than  small  communities  but  a  greater  rate  of loss  for 
commercial buildings  (see table 5). 

Loss of Designated Buildings  (Category 1) 
Designated buildings (Category 1) account for  13% of the total losses (see table 6). 
In all of the communities in the study 433 buildings were lost in total, and fifty-eight 
of these  losses  were  designated  buildings,  formally  recognised  under the  Ontario 
Heritage Act. 6 

Some communities, such as Waterloo  and Sault Ste Marie, have  not lost any  of 
their designated buildings. That may indicate that the process of designation seems 
to be working well  for them.  However,  other communities have  lost many of their 
designated  buildings,  thus  indicating that more needs  to be done  to  protect their 
built heritage. 

Richmond  Hill  has  lost  one  out  of  every  five  of  its  designated  buildings. 
Mississauga has lost one out of every ten of its designated buildings.  Scarborough 
has  lost  one  out of every  eleven  of its  designated  buildings.  Brantford, Toronto, 

5. This might be comparable to the situation in  Europe where,  prior to the beginning of the heritage 
conservation movement in the  20th century, there had been large-scale demolition of older structures 
such as  much of medieval Paris  and the walls  and gates of many cities such as Vienna. 

6. The Act allows for a total of 270 days' delay when a demolition permit for  a  designated building is 
sought by the owner but cannot,  ultimately,  prevent demolition.

Fergus, and London included within their list  of designated buildings a number of 
properties contained within heritage districts. 

Loss of Listed Buildings (Category 2) 
listed buildings  account for  65%  of the  total  losses.  For all  communities  in  the 
study,  282  of the  433  losses  were  listed  buildings.  Based  on  the  sample  for  this 
study, Ontario has  lost over 3%  of its  listed buildings over sixteen years. While  in 
some communities the listing of their significant heritage buildings seems to help to 
preserve them, others are losing a high percentage of them  (see table  7). 

Richmond  Hill  has  lost  one  out  of  every  five  of  its  listed  buildings  and 
Scarborough has  lost  one  out  of every  six.  Many  of the  same  communities  that 
struggle  to  hold  onto  their  designated  (Category  1)  buildings  are  also  struggling 
with their listed buildings  (Category 2). 

The majority of communities that participated in the study collected information 
only  on  Categories  1  and  2,  but in the  other categories  (Categories  3  to  6)  the 
percentage of loss  reported is similar to mid-range losses  reported in Categories  1 
and 2. Toronto presents a particular challenge in this regard. There, Category 1 and 
2  information  was  collected  and  the  results  showed  that while  several  important 
buildings  were  demolished  (thirty-four), the percentage  rate  of loss  was  low.  It is 
suspected,  however,  that  if  information  had  been  collected  on  Category  4 
(architectural  studies),  the  results  would  have  been  different.  Many  architectural 
studies have been made on Toronto that include significant buildings that have not 
been designated or listed but have  indeed been demolished. 

Reasons for Loss 
The  last  columns  in  tables  6  and  7  show  the  main  reasons  given  for  the  loss  of 
buildings in each community. For Category 2-listed buildings (table 7)-unsym 
pathetic development is  the predominant reason for  loss,  while  Category  !-des 
ignated buildings  (table 6)-suffered destruction from fire,  neglect, and vandalism 
as  well  as  unsympathetic development. 

A number of volunteers provided anecdotal information with their data sets that 
further paints the picture of the circumstances of destruction of heritage buildings 
in Ontario communities. What follows  are a number of those stories. 

In Mississauga, much effort has been made by private owners, churches and the 
municipality to preserve buildings under threat of destruction.  Often, however, the 
process of redevelopment was long and drawn out and resulted in deterioration of 
the building in question or their loss  due to arson.  Mississauga,  Orangeville,  Port 
Hope, Whitby,  Cobourg,  Scarborough, and Richmond Hill have all  lost buildings 
due  to  neglect  of the  owners  after  they  were  listed  or  designated.  The  heritage 
legislation  does not require the owners  to keep  their buildings in  good repair and 
after years  of neglect they can become unsafe  and therefore condemned. This can 
result in some buildings being taken down while other buildings can become targets 
for  arson  and  vandalism.  Municipal  property  standards  provisions  could  be 
enforced but this is  rarely done when buildings are unoccupied.

In a  1997 recommendation for a Plan of Subdivision in Waterloo,  a  section was 
devoted to provisions for saving an old Mennonite farmhouse. The house stood on 
a  section of a  large tract of land that was  being developed. The city was  prepared 
specially  to  zone  the  land  on  which  the  house  stood  in  order  to  facilitate  its 
retention. The developer had agreed to try to find a buyer for the building. The City 
of Waterloo,  however,  did  not  make  this  a  condition  in  granting  the  Plan  of 
Subdivision.  The  development  property  in  question  changed  hands  and  the 
subsequent owner made no  effort to  maintain the house or offer the property for 
sale. This was done in spite of the fact that there were willing buyers who would have 
been  more  than  happy  to  have  paid  market  value  and  would  have  restored  the 
building. 

The owner of a car dealership in Cobourg demolished a 'model school' to expand 
his  display space for vehicles. The school was  one of six  identical schools built by 
Egerton Ryerson,  the father of universal public education in Ontario when he was 
superintendent of schools in the early 19th century. Of the original six schools only 
one, in Ottawa, remains.

Lost Heritage 

165 

Orangeville  had  a  strange  end  to  its  first  designated  building. The  Jull  Mill's 
designation  was  removed  by the  council  so  that demolition could  take  place. The 
land on which it stood was re-designated and vague plans now exist to turn this land 
into  a  heritage  park- without the  original  mill,  of course. 

In  Richmond  Hill  a  number  of  significant  historic  buildings  have  been 
demolished  in  order  to  create  vacant  lots-
the  sites  of at  least  nineteen  out  of 
eighty-eight demolished buildings are vacant land . Richmond Hill has also moved a 
number  of buildings  out  of the  municipality  in  order  to  save  the  buildings  from 
demolition.  Some  of the  buildings,  however,  still  stand  within  a  'heritage  park'  in 
another  city  but  are  nevertheless  recorded  as  losses  due  to  their  relocation. 
Richmond Hill has also  saved materials from  demolished buildings in  order to  use 
them in  other buildings.  Like other municipalities,  this  town has also been a victim 
of  failed  promises  from  owners  to  save  buildings.  Table  8  details  the  types  of 
buildings lost for  each community. 

After several years of bitter debate and what was described in the press as bullying 
and insensitivity  to  local  concerns, a large development company was  permitted to 
demolish an entire block of historic commercial buildings in London, most of which 
were  designated. The  developer  claimed  that  they  would  build  a  new  downtown 
shopping mall that would bring economic prosperity to the city.  Over ten years later, 
the  developer  long  since  having  abandoned  the  site,  it  remained  an  ugly  urban 
wasteland, a gaping hole in the middle of a once thriving city centre. The city's lack 
of a  downtown  plan  and  a  commitment  to  heritage  conservation  was  cited  as  the

main reasons for  this  debacle . The city,  at its  own expense,  has  now  constructed a 
hockey  arena on  the  site. 

Anecdotal  information  from  the  rural  municipalities  of Brockton  and  Central 
Elgin  indicated  that  a  high  number of agricultural  buildings  are  being  lost  in  the 
countryside .  Agricultural  buildings  are  seldom  designated,  listed,  plaqued  or 
recognised  in  any  other official  manner and  so  are  completely without protection. 

Types of Buildings Lost 
Of the different building types, residences have suffered the greatest total loss. While 
in the  1999 CIHB study re  idences did not have  the highest percentage of loss,  the 
present  study  shows  that  residences  suffered  losses  far  above  any  other  type  of 
building  (see  figure  5).  Why  is  this?  Perhaps  the  majority  of  commercial  and 
industrial  buildings  that  were  under  pressure  of destruction  before  have  already 
been lost. 

The same communities that are losing the  highest percentage of heritage overall 
are  losing  the  highest  number  of  residences.  This  could  be  a  result  of  the 
considerable growth pressure in  these  communities. 

Conclusions 
Even  when  recognised  as  historically  significant,  buildings  can  be  and  are  being 
demolished in  Ontario. The loss  of listed buildings is  occurring at almost twice  the 
rate of the loss of designated buildings, thus illustrating that designation offer  some 
degree  of protection  over  simply  listing  buildings.  Overall,  Ontario  ha 
lost  433 
buildings  in  a  sample  of  twenty-two  communities.  If  this  percentage  were 
extrapolated over the whole province, there might have been as  many  I , 700 historic 
buildings lost during the  last  sixteen years. 

Lost Heritage 

167 

The loss of heritage buildings seems to have decelerated over the last twenty years. 
This could be because  preservation  laws  and efforts,  at  least  in  some places,  are 
working more effectively. On the other hand, it could be that we have already lost so 
many buildings  that  there  is  now  less  pressure  on  those  that  remain.  For  many 
communities  in  this  study,  preservation  laws  are  working  well  and  they  are 
preserving many of their most significant heritage buildings but there are also some 
communities  where  legislation  is  not  providing  the  protection  it  should.  The 
challenge now is  to develop  a strategy whereby the legislation can protect heritage 
buildings in all  Ontario  communities.  Essentially,  this  research indicates  the need 
for  stronger  conservation  regulation  under  the  Ontario  Heritage  Act.  The 
knowledge is  available if the incentives  can be found  to  encourage conservation. 7 
Residences are being lost at a much greater rate than any other type of building. 
Buildings  are  being  lost  primarily  to  unsympathetic  development.  Communities 
that are experiencing a high growth rate stand to lose more heritage buildings than 
slower-growing communities. 

While heritage legislation and the listing of buildings by municipalities can help 
to delay demolition (but not actually prevent it), it cannot protect a building against 
neglect.  Some  form  of  fmancial  assistance,  tax  relief  or  other  measures  that 
recognise the value of heritage structures to the community might make them less 
vulnerable  to  redevelopment and to the neglect that leads  to  fire  and vandalism. s 
The  federal  government's  Historic  Places  Initiative  and  new  tax  provisions  in 
Ontario are  a good start and need to be supported. 

This study has illustrated a need for more consistent and standard approaches to 
recognising historic structures. Through the collection of data for this study it was 
found that there is  no consistency between municipalities and l.ACACs as  to how 
a  building  is  put  on  a  list  of significant  structures.  Consistency  would  facilitate 
better planning and identification.
