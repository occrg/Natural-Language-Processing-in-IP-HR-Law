Optimal Enforcement of Music Copyright in
Sub-Saharan Africa: Reality or a Myth?

Marisella N. Ouma

The enforcement of copyright and related rights in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa is
not optimal and this has a negative impact on the development of the copyright industries.
This is attested by the high levels of piracy within the sub-continent within the music, ﬁlm and
book publishing sectors. It is not for lack of law; indeed, copyright laws in Africa have been
in existence since the colonial era. The laws, it seems, are just but part of the problem
although the real issue is the enforcement. The main purpose of this article is to try and
conceptualize copyright enforcement, which the author hopes will aid understanding as to
why the enforcement of copyright in sub-Saharan Africa is sub-optimal.

Enforcement of copyright has been at the core of copyright development in both the
copyright and author’s rights systems. In France, for instance, after the introduc-
tion of printing in the ﬁfteenth century, piracy emerged. The competitors and other
interested parties would reproduce the works without compensating the original
stationer. The stationers resorted to obtaining permission from the King to print
and to prohibit any other person from printing the protected publications. The
Statute of Anne, on the other hand, was inspired by the need of the Stationers’
Company to protect their works from unauthorized printing. The earliest form of
protection for copyright as noted by various scholars was to protect printers against
piracy.

Core Normative and Institutional Issues in Music Copyright Enforcement

What is Enforcement?
Various scholars have attempted to deﬁne enforcement in their various ﬁelds of
specialization and they all come to the same or similar deﬁnitions; there are
philosophical, ethical, economic and legal deﬁnitions of enforcement. Blacks Law
Dictionary deﬁnes enforcement as the act or process of ensuring compliance with
the law. It is the process of compelling the compliance with the law, mandate,
command, decree or agreement. Enforcement is also deﬁned as the process by which
violations are investigated and a legal sanction applied to the violator (Posner,
1998). The legal sanction may either be through administrative procedures, civil
remedies or criminal sanctions. The civil remedies include injunctions, which will
stop the violator from further violations and damages that entail the compensation
of the right holder by the violator. The sanctions may be criminal sanctions,

whereby the violator is given a custodial sentence and/or required to pay a ﬁne for
the violation. Enforcement could thus be remedial or ‘‘sanctional’’.1 Law enforce-
ment involves the detection and punishment of violations of the law. It could be
speciﬁc, in that it targets a particular group within the society, or it may be general.
The sanctions can either be through the public sector, for instance the police and the
judicial system, or it may be through private agencies or a combination of both as
shall be discussed below. Enforcement thus requires the relevant institutions to give
force or effect of law compelling obedience and the requirement for one to pay the
consequences for non-conformity.

Enforcement in the context of copyright and other intellectual property entails
the prevention of infringements of the rights or obtaining remedies for infringement
of conferred rights.2 The copyright law grants exclusive rights to the right holders to
control the use of their works. As these are statutory rights, the copyright law goes
further to outlaw any unauthorized use with exceptions and provides criminal and
civil sanctions for the violations. Enforcement of copyright involves three compo-
nents: the copyright law, the investigation of violations and the use of the sanctions
provided by the law. This is done through the various agencies that are mandated to
enforce copyright law.

Why have Copyright Enforcement
Theoretically, the law grants the rights and provides for the exclusive exploitation of
the rights. Once the law has been put in place, it is assumed that society will abide by
the same. In the perfect society, the mere existence of the laws would be sufﬁcient to
ensure conformity to the laws. It is assumed that the society would be self-
regulatory and adhere to the laws. However, as society is not perfect and there is
a possibility of non-conformity, the laws not only lay out what constitutes an
infringement of the rights granted but also makes provision for remedies and
sanctions. The life of the law is in its enforcement. While this might be disputed by
various scholars,3 the law without corresponding enforcement is of no use to those
it seeks to protect. This has been the case with regard to copyright protection in
most sub-Saharan Africa.4 The laws set the rules and the norms by which society
should adhere to, but laws do not enforce themselves. To ensure enforcement, the
laws, in addition to the above, should provide for the structures and mechanisms to
ensure conformity. The people governed by the law must execute them through
legal and administrative enforcement structures.5

Enforcement of the law is part and parcel of any legal regime. Provisions exist
within the law to ensure that people conform to the laws. If these provisions did not
exist, then it is assumed that it would result in non-conformity. These provisions are
intended to ensure high conformity to the law and include remedies and sanctions
such as damages, custodial sentences and ﬁnes. The threat of civil sanctions as well
as the criminal sanctions that lead to restraint as well as deprivation is, in many
cases, enough to induce one to conform and avoid breaking the law. Enforcement in
all areas of law is very important. For instance, in the case of contract law, a signed

contract is enforceable under the law and either party may seek legal redress in the
event of a breach of the contract. The aggrieved party has the right to sue for the
breach and even claim damages. Another good example is the Penal Code, which
lays down the criminal offences and the penalties for committing those offences.
These include deprivation of one’s freedom, ﬁnes and or some form of physical
punishment. The sanctions ensure that the majority within society conform. There
is a small percentage who will not be deterred and when caught face the
consequences. Most copyright laws criminalize copyright infringement and include
these provisions.6

However, one might argue that people conform to the law not because of the
consequences for non-conformity but because this would be deemed to be the right
thing to do. The majority of the population is bound to conform to the copyright
law, not because of the threat of sanctions for infringement but because they deem it
proper to obey the copyright law like any other law. This brings about the whole
debate of morality and the law, which could easily be the subject of a separate thesis
and will not be discussed in this research.7 In the case of copyright, infringement still
goes on despite the law providing for enforcement provisions. Most copyright laws
clearly state what constitutes infringement and provide for civil as well as criminal
sanctions for the non-conformists. Copyright laws have been in place in most
developing countries (DCs) for over 20 years, but this has not stemmed the rampant
infringement of copyright. From books to music, infringing copies dominate the
market. However, the consequences for breaching the law in most cases are either
non-existent or nominal. This can be seen from the dismal number of cases that are
brought before the courts and the judgments thereafter. To illustrate this point
further, the author shall use a hypothetical case in the music industry. A owns a
music distributing business in a DC. DC has had the current copyright laws since
1966. The laws provide for both civil and criminal sanctions for infringement.
However, since 1966, not a single case has been brought to court. A has, for the last
10 years, distributed pirated music of both local and international repertoire and his
business has continued to ﬂourish at the expense of the local artistes. Anytime the
artistes report the matter to the police, no action is taken as they do not see any
criminal violation of the law. The artistes cannot afford to take any legal action
because of their poor economic status. So A continues to trade in pirated copies
even with the existing legal regime on copyright protection. Lack of enforcement
has contributed to the current situation in DC.

Unfortunately, there are those who would like to use the works and beneﬁt
from the same without the authority of the right holder and without compensating
them. Such unauthorized use may be prejudicial to the economic interests of the
right holder, as well as infringe on his moral rights. This situation has been made
worse by new technologies, as they allow the users to access the works more easily
and at no cost.8 The right holder would thus want to ensure that his interests are
well protected from such misuse and seek to enforce his rights. Under copyright
law, there are very clear provisions with regard to the infringement of copyright and

the remedies available to the right holders. Without the enforcement mechanisms,
the unauthorized use of copyright protected works would be the norm as there
would be no repercussions even though the law provides for the rights.9 Further,
copyright falls under the realm of public goods. Several people can use music, watch
a television broadcast, read a book or use a computer program at the same time
without diminishing the value or denying others access to the goods. Once the initial
works have been made, the subsequent reproductions are the ones that are sold,
hired, broadcast, imported or communicated to the public. There are those who will
not see anything wrong and if with using the works without permission and if left
unchecked would continue to do so. The commercial users of music such as the
broadcasting stations, restaurants and other entertainment spots are basically
businesses and their mission is to maximize on proﬁts at the minimum cost. Music
contributes to a certain extent to their proﬁts and if there was no enforcement of
copyright, they are likely to continue using the music without compensating the
right holders. Copyright-protected works, especially with the new digital technol-
ogies, are easier to reproduce and distribute to the wider public.

Laws are not necessarily a value in themselves as they do not have aesthetic or
intrinsic value. In the music industry, there is a high propensity to use protected
works without the authority of the owner. Music has the potential of raising
revenue for the third party without necessarily divesting the owner of the original
item and is thus a favourite candidate for unauthorized use. Enforcement of
copyright is necessary to ensure that the rights are not exploited by unauthorized
third parties at the expense of the copyright owner.

Conceptualizing the Legal and Institutional Framework
on Enforcement of Copyright

Civil Remedies and Criminal Sanctions
The copyright laws may be enforced through use of both criminal and civil
sanctions.10 Intellectual property rights are generally considered to be under the
realm of proprietary rights and infringements are considered to be torts. Infringe-
ments are dealt with as civil violations. Criminal sanctions are normally applied in
cases where the infringements are deemed to be serious violations.11 The criminal
sanctions may be monetary or non-monetary, or a combination of both. The
monetary sanctions include the ﬁnes that are awarded by the courts while the non-
monetary sanctions include custodial sentences and other non-custodial punishments
such as community service and reputation penalties.12 There are various civil remedies
available under the national laws and these include injunctions, damages and account
of proﬁts, delivery up, search and seizure as well as the Anton Piller Orders.13

One might argue that copyright infringement should be dealt with through civil
litigation. There are certain countries such as Uganda that do not criminalize
copyright infringement.14 Various reasons exist for the criminal enforcement of
copyright: ﬁrst, criminal sanctions are necessary to curtail infringements that would

otherwise not be adequately dealt with using civil sanctions. For instance, the
damages payable for the copyright infringement might be negligible in relation to
the transgression and the custodial sentences would serve as a deterrent effect.
Secondly, criminal enforcement would bring to justice those who are judgment-
proof, who would otherwise go unpunished.15 The use of custodial sentences such
as imprisonment will have a higher deterrent effect as opposed to the monetary
sanctions where the infringer can pay for the damages and continue with their
infringement.

The laws provide reasons for conformity, and copyright laws are no exception.
The question as to whether to use criminal sanctions or rely on civil remedies is
crucial in the enforcement of copyright within the music industry. There are various
factors that determine the choice (Harms, 2004). First, one has to consider the
available enforcement mechanisms, their powers and how they operate. The type of
court that determines the cases, the availability of law enforcement agencies such as
the police, as well as their attitude towards copyright cases need to be put into
consideration. In most DCs, the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the
pecuniary value of the case.16 The copyright laws sometimes stipulate which courts
have the right to determine copyright cases.17 The laws do not create special courts
for the determination of copyright cases. This affects the length of time that a case
may be determined by the courts. Civil cases tend to take a longer time in
comparison to criminal cases. Secondly, the relief available to the claimant is
crucial. Civil actions offer immediate relief through injunctions and the promise of
recovering the loss through damages might be more appealing to the copyright
owner.18 On the other hand, criminal sanctions offer deterrent and often punitive
remedies. The custodial sentences or hefty ﬁnes might deter future infringements of
the rights. However, the claimant stands to gain nothing in monetary terms as the
ﬁnes are paid to the state. The ﬁnes and custodial sentences might deter future
transgressions but the claimant is not compensated for the loss suffered. Third is the
cost of the legal proceedings. In criminal cases, the state takes over the proceedings,
and bears the monetary cost of the same. The plaintiff is only required to make the
necessary report to the police and the state mechanism takes over, from the
investigation to calling the witnesses and prosecuting the case. The plaintiff does
not incur any costs apart from costs incurred to attend the proceedings. In civil
cases, the claimant has to consider the legal costs incurred during the proceedings,
such as the ﬁling fees, the cost of hiring a lawyer, etc. The cost might be prohibitive
to the litigant and, in some case, might end up being more expensive than the
damages sought. Furthermore, there is the risk that if one loses the case, they will
have to cover the costs of the proceedings.19 In many cases, the claimant is not
willing to take the risk and will either opt for criminal prosecution or forfeit any
legal recourse. Fourth is the issue of proof. Common law liability is established on a
balance of probability; while in criminal cases, the court prosecution has to prove
the case beyond reasonable doubt. It is upon the alleged infringer, in civil cases, to
disprove the claimant’s ownership. The advantages of criminal proceedings in

copyright have been summed up as hereunder: (1) prosecution does not have to
prove title; (2) criminal sanctions have a deterrent effect; (3) there is a possibility for
personal criminal liability of directors who cannot hide behind the company; (4)
and the saving of costs. The disadvantages are, ﬁrst, the lack of discovery
procedures. Second is the inability to compromise or settle the case.20 Third is lack
of expertise on copyright matters within the judiciary. Fourth is the lack of
compensation to the right holder and ﬁnally the burden of proof (Fry, 2005).21

Civil enforcement has its advantages over the criminal system and these,
according to Freidman, include the following: the civil enforcement of laws, and,
in this case, copyright, replaces the centralized government-run system of catching
criminals with a decentralized market. Some evidence points out that civil enforce-
ment has a lower cost than the centralized government machinery (Freidman, 1995).
This is on the assumption that a purely civil remedy exists in the absence of the
government machinery and would involve alternative dispute-resolution mechan-
isms such as arbitrations and out-of-court settlements. The second advantage is the
fact that the civil enforcement provides reimbursement to the person whose rights
have been infringed. This is normally calculated in terms of damages or loss of
proﬁts. The promise of a reimbursement is enough for the right holder to pursue a
claim. It will give them the impetus to report a transgression of rights as the beneﬁts
outweigh any perceived risks (Freidman, 1995). The third advantage is the fact that
the conﬂict of interest between the enforcer and his employees such as bribery and
precautions to prevent bribery under current institutions is eliminated (Freidman,
1995). This would apply to private enforcers such as the industry-based organiza-
tions that deal with infringements, especially piracy. The purely private enforcement
system is not without problems. For instance, the damages are usually limited to the
actual damage suffered by the copyright owner, who is only limited to damages that
will make him whole (Freidman, 1995). This means that in the case of a perennial
copyright infringer, the damages will only be equal to the infringement for which he
was caught. Any other infringements that are not subject to the claim will go
uncompensated. To illustrate this point further, take the example of a music
‘‘pirate’’, who is constantly involved in copyright infringement. He may be caught
only one out of the ten times that he engages in ‘‘piracy’’. The owner will only be
compensated for the one time that he was caught and gets nothing for the other nine
times that the infringer was not apprehended. There are instances where the
infringer will not be able to pay the ﬁne imposed and, in most cases, the right
holder can do nothing about it, short of committing him to civil jail, which might
not always produce the desired result.22 The criminal system then comes to the
rescue as there is the possibility of punishing infringers who are judgment-proof
through custodial sentences.23

Public and Private Enforcement
The enforcement of copyright and related rights has been within both the public
and private realm of enforcement.24 The civil remedies require greater participation

from the individual than in the case of criminal sanctions, but both entail an
interplay between the public and private realms in enforcement. Criminal law
enforcement was almost entirely a private affair in primitive societies. In England,
for instance, in the eighteenth century, law enforcement was left entirely to the
private enforcers known as the bounty hunters. Parliament and municipal autho-
rities paid bounties for the apprehension and conviction of those who transgressed
the law (Miller, 1990; Posner, 1981). In the case of offences that were punished
through the payment of ﬁnes, the ﬁne collected was divided between the Crown and
the private enforcer (Krent, 1989; Landes and Posner, 1975). With time, criminal
enforcement of the law became the domain of the state. The police took over the
apprehension and charging of the criminals while the courts determined the cases
and the ﬁnes were retained by the state. In both civil and common law jurisdictions,
the criminal prosecution of copyright cases and other cases in general is within the
domain of the state.

From an economic perspective, there are various reasons for the existence of
public law enforcement (Posner, 1981). First is the cost of enforcement; this might
be prohibitive in relation to the offence or claim. A private enforcer will be driven
by the ability to maximize on the returns and, if the cost of apprehending the
offender is higher than the expected return, then the private enforcer is unlikely to
pursue the claim to apprehend the offender. In copyright cases, the enforcer, in this
case, the copyright owner25 or private organization within the industry, would ﬁnd
the cost of trailing and apprehending the criminal too high. The costs include
investigation, arresting and conﬁning the offender, raiding the premises and the cost
of prosecuting the case in court. Public enforcement, on the other hand, is publicly
funded and the cost is not a central issue as most public enforcement agencies such
as the police operate on an annual budget from central government. The cases will,
however, be handled according to priority. Criminal cases involving drugs, murder
and other capital offences will deﬁnitely take precedence over criminal infringement
cases in music. Secondly, the budgets granted to the public enforcement bodies tend
to be small in relation to the potential gains from the enforcement, especially as a
private proﬁt-making maximizing enforcer would appraise them. An example is the
police force, whereby the cost of enforcement of law is higher than the expected
return from the private enforcer’s point of view. Third is the prospect of the
innocent person being prosecuted by the private enforcers. This is because the
private enforcer is driven by the promise of reward per prosecution. Generally, the
industry supports public enforcement. This is due to various factors such as the cost
of enforcement, especially at the individual level; piracy is considered an economic
crime that has a negative impact on the author, the economy, as well as the culture.
The increasing levels of piracy, as well as the link to organized crime, require more
than the private enforcement.

According to Posner, a major criticism of public enforcement is that it creates
incentives for bribery and corruption because the gain to the enforcer from
enforcement is generally less than the offender’s potential penalty. Indeed, cases

of corruption within public law enforcement in copyright cases abound. For
instance, in Kenya, infringers often have more money than the copyright owners
and easily pay their way to avoid prosecution. From an industry perspective, public
enforcement has its shortcomings. The success rate of copyright prosecution cases is
quite low because of various factors such as the lack of knowledge of copyright
among the lawyers, police and the judiciary. This would lead to wrongly drafted
charges and other technicalities that would have cases dismissed.26 It could also be
attributed to the general attitude of society as a whole to copyright infringement as
it would not be seen as a criminal offence.

The role of private enforcement of laws is twofold: ﬁrst, private suits can be
used for the purposes of stopping an infringing act, deterring future infringements
as well as correcting socially harmful violations of the law. Secondly, the private
enforcement serves to compensate the right holder for the harm or damage
occasioned by the infringement of the rights. The infringer is compelled to comply
with the law, make restitution and perhaps pay damages or civil ﬁnes. These two
functions are normally intertwined.27 There are many reasons for the existence of
private enforcement of rights using the existing legal mechanisms. Private enforce-
ment can increase the social resources devoted to law enforcement, in a way
complementing the government enforcement efforts. The private parties are, in
some instances, in a better position to monitor the compliance of copyright laws
and detect the violations. The government might not be able to monitor such
violations effectively and thus would rely on the private enforcers. For instance, in
the music industry, the government often acts on information supplied by the
private enforcer such as the anti-piracy organization and is able to follow-up on the
violations.28 Stephenson notes that:

Private enforcement enables the citizens who value the public good more
highly to subsidise enforcement by bearing some of the costs of
monitoring and prosecution functions themselves. Thus, the citizen
suit provisions might implement the functional equivalent of a more
efﬁcient tax system, in which the citizens’ tax rates vary in proportion to
the value they place on the public good.29

In the copyright industry, what does this translate to? The enforcement agencies
such as International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Federation
Against Copyright Theft (FACT) and Kenya Music Anti Piracy Association
(KEMAA), among other organizations that deal with music piracy, are willing to
bear some of the costs of monitoring and prosecution. FACT is a private
organization based in the Kingdom that deals with what they term as copyright
theft. They carry out the investigations, and help in the prosecution of copyright
cases in the ﬁlm and broadcasting sectors.30 The IFPI, which deals with music
piracy around the globe, actually bears the costs of investigations into the cases of
music copyright infringement, before turning over the same to the public agencies
for further action.31

Private enforcement faces various challenges and has its own disadvantages.
First, the availability of resources might hinder the enforcement efforts by the
private enforcer. This is due to the fact that the players in the industry, especially in
Africa, lack monetary and administrative resources to follow-up the enforcement.
They often have to raise the money from the various individuals and other sponsors
for their enforcement activities. Private enforcers sometimes lack the capacity to
decide on the merits of the case and would take up cases that are not meritorious.
The public agencies, it is argued, have the capacity to sieve out the non-meritorious
cases and save on resources. This is debatable as evidence exists that the private
agencies will only pursue cases that they view have merit and, because of their
limited resources, will prioritize the cases.

The role of the public agencies was inferred as opposed to being explicitly

provided for the in the copyright laws.

Private enforcement agencies concerned with the enforcement of copyright and
related rights within the music industry include the Collective Management
Organizations (CMO), the anti-piracy groups and other industry-based organiza-
tions. While civil and criminal jurisdictions are legally distinct, in practice, the use of
both private and public enforcement measures in the enforcement of copyright,
namely the monitoring, detection, investigation and prosecution, is a mixture of
both public and private enforcement (Urbas, 2005).

Public and Private Partnerships
From the foregoing, one can see that public enforcement and private enforcement
are both necessary within the music industry. Private enforcement and public
enforcement both have their advantages and, disadvantages, and in real legal
systems both exist. Copyright enforcement is carried out through both private
agencies and public agencies and, in many instances, there is a collaborative effort
between the two. The private agencies are mainly concerned with the investigation
and monitoring of infringement activities, while the public agencies, such as the
police, judiciary and customs ofﬁcials, are concerned with the apprehension of the
infringers and determination of cases and suits. Copyright is normally seen as a
public good as well as a private property in that the enforcement can be carried out
privately or through the public agencies. The role of each agency in the public and
private sector is clearly set out. The right holder has a choice of either instituting
civil proceedings as an individual or reporting the infringement to the public
agencies that would proceed based on the information handed over by the right
owner. Sometimes, the cost of monitoring and instituting the proceedings might be
too much for the individual to bear. In such cases, the individual would join an
industry association or get a private agency to pursue the claim on his behalf.32 In
the following paragraphs, both the public and private enforcement agencies will be
analysed.

Alliances have come up between the private and public agencies to complement
each other. Public agencies such as the police, the judiciary and customs ofﬁcials

already have established networks within the each jurisdiction. On the other hand,
as the private organizations are normally industry based, their networks are limited
and they would have to expend extra time and resources to enforce the rights. In
such cases, it is possible for the private agencies to work with the public agencies.
The private agencies will provide the intelligence and the public agencies will use
this to track down the violators and eventually apprehend them and arraign them in
court. A good example of these public/private partnerships is the continuing
collaboration between the IFPI and the various police and customs departments.33
The administration of anti-piracy devices is another example of a collaborative effort
between the public and private sector. In Ghana, for instance, the administration of
the anti-piracy security device is a collaborative effort between the Copyright Ofﬁce,
the Inland Revenue Department, the Musicians’ Union and the CMO.34

Factors that Affect Enforcement

Conformity to the law has a bearing on enforcement of law especially in the ﬁeld of
copyright. If the system fails to ensure a high degree of conformity, it may be
because of various factors that include but are not limited to the following.

Existing Legal Structures
The function of a legal system, to quote McNeilly, is

To provide those subject to it with an assurance of stability sufﬁcient to
permit of their having good reason to comply with its requirements
(Mcneilly, 1968).

The existence of the law that imposes a legal obligation to comply is necessary
in any legal system. As not everyone is sufﬁciently inspired to respect the law, actual
legal systems usually rely on sanctions to secure a sufﬁciently high level of
conformity (Mcneilly, 1968, p. 63). Copyright provides for this obligation on
society to abide by the law, failure of which would amount to civil or criminal
sanctions. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, the law is a system of rules that
provides those subject to them with a reason to conform.

The problem of how to enforce the law is closely connected to the
question of how far we style law and seek to give effect as law is capable
of enforcement; and we look into the history of the subject we soon
come to see much of this problem of enforcing law is in reality a problem
of the intrinsic limitations upon effective legal action.35

The law is a system of rules, the existence of which provides those subject to
them with reason for conforming. It is important to note that because something is
required or omitted by the law, this will not be the only reason for the doing or
omitting. The incentive could either be positive of negative. In the case of copyright, it
is a negative incentive as failure to comply with the law has negative consequences on
the infringer. The copyright laws thus give those subject to it the choice to either

adhere to the law or face the consequences. If the law does not give clear provisions
for the enforcement, the society will not necessarily abide to the law.36 Copyright laws
have prior to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement
had few or no enforcement provisions. Given, they all make wilful infringement illegal
and also provide for civil and criminal sanctions but what is conspicuously lacking is
how to go about enforcement. It is only after the TRIPS Agreement in 1994 that the
member countries decided to provide for effective enforcement of copyright laws.37
The copyright laws in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal and
Mali, among others, clearly deﬁne what infringement entails. They also set out the
consequences for infringement.38 The law should be enforceable.39 The will of the
enforcement agencies is critical in the enforcement of the laws. This brings us to the
issue of the government policy on the enforcement of copyright and related rights. It is
notable that several governments in sub-Saharan Africa did not have policies on
copyright and related rights. Other scholars argue that the sanctions provided by the
law are not the reason why people abide by the law; they would still abide by the law
even if they knew that there were no sanctions for non-conformity.

Society responds differently to the laws and rules that govern it and tends to be
unwilling to enforce laws that it deems to be of no beneﬁt to society. Copyright laws
in Africa were seen to be foreign and were for the beneﬁt of the foreign right
holders.40 Most African countries did not accede to the Berne Convention until they
were forced to conform to the provisions found in the Berne Convention through
the TRIPS Agreement.41 When drafting the laws, it is common for the governments
in Africa to engage the services of experts from outside the continent. While this
may be a bonus in terms of expertise in matters of copyright and related rights, their
recommendations and ﬁndings are biased towards Western ideologies (Bernard,
2003). They also make assumptions as to what they think would be best for the
country based on the limited contact they have with the main industry players. In
the case of copyright law in Africa, the history of copyright law has contributed to
the current state of copyright enforcement. First, at independence, most countries in
Africa simply carried over the ordinances that existed during the colonial era and
simply changed the titles to reﬂect their political freedom.42 Secondly, the subse-
quent changes made to the laws were in response to the pressure to ratify the
existing international conventions. These amendments did not take into account the
prevailing circumstances within the African countries and were largely based on the
interests of the industries within the developed countries.43 The changes brought
about by the TRIPS Agreement were made to ensure that the laws were in
conformity with the Agreement, failure of which would result in economic sanctions
within the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework. Being member states of
the WTO, the African countries had no choice but to make the required changes.
Thirdly, the contribution by the authors within the industry has been minimal.44
The investors within the music industry have a bigger say as they try to press for
laws that protect their investments. This is because of the fact that the music
industry has become highly commercialized and the law seems to support the same,

as copyright is treated like any other moveable property.45 Furthermore, the
authors’ participation in the law-making process is limited and the laws are simply
imposed upon them.

For enforcement of copyright and related rights, the law should ensure that it
(i) provides for the infringement of and penalties therein; (ii) provides for structures
for enforcement; (iii) provides for mechanisms where the infringers are penalized for
their transgressions; (iv) it should reﬂect the will of those it seeks to protect; and (v)
it should be grounded on the existing policy on copyright and related rights.

Societal Perceptions

Although the State makes the rules, there are norms and informal modes
of behaviour that facilitate enforcement of the laws. Equally important
are the informal and often tacit rules that structure the social conduct.
Formal rules . . . make up a small part of the sum of constraints that shape
the choices . . . the governing structure is overwhelmingly deﬁned by codes
of conduct, norms of behaviour and conventions (North, 1990).

Intellectual Property rights are statutory rights. This does not, however, mean that
they are strictly governed by the existing laws. There are societal factors that affect
the enforcement of rights especially in the ﬁeld of copyright. How society views
copyright and related rights is central to the enforcement of these rights. Society
may view the law as authoritative46 and controlling, in which case, non-conformity
would lead to severe deprivation. In such cases, society has no choice but to abide
by the law or face the consequences. Acceptance of authority and susceptibility to
moral pressure are important factors in the enforcement of law. If society does not
accept the law and is not morally bound to adhere to it, then there will be no
enforcement. Copyright presents a very interesting case. By its very nature, it is an
intangible property and is a public good.47 The initial costs of creating the works
might be high but the subsequent reproductions incur nominal or no costs at all.
The unauthorized reproduction is thus not seen as a violation of any rights. Society
does not view the infringement as a crime or civil transgression of one’s rights. How
is copyright law as it relates to music perceived by society? Music was an integral
part of society in the traditional society and was governed by social norms.48 The
copyright laws as introduced during the colonial era and the subsequent laws
individualized music copyright and it was treated as any other moveable property.
This was seen as a foreign concept. Society is more likely to abide by the law if the
law emanates from within the society. Copyright law is perceived to be a law that
beneﬁts the foreign right holders.

The nature of penalties plays a crucial role in determining the level of
conformity to the laws. If the penalties are nominal or non-deterrent, then society
will view it as a minor offence and will be willing to risk the penalties. From an
economic perspective, the infringer will weigh the risk of getting apprehended
against the beneﬁt of committing the infringement. If the risk of getting appre-

hended and subsequently getting the sanctions applied is lower than the beneﬁt to
be accrued from committing the infringing act, then he will proceed with the
infringement. If, on the other hand, the risk of getting apprehended is higher than
the perceived gains from the infringement, then he is likely not to break the law
(Shavell, 2003). The proﬁt one stands to make from reproducing, selling or
distributing music is in many cases higher than the ﬁne that they will be expected
to pay or damages awarded by the courts if apprehended. The likelihood of being
caught and convicted is almost zero (Phillips, 2001). And if convicted, the likelihood
of getting the maximum sentence is even more remote (Harms, 2004). In Kenya for
instance, the pirates were willing to take the risk as the ﬁnes and sanctions awarded
by the court were minimal or the cases were thrown out for technical reasons. Thus,
there was no real threat of criminal or civil sanctions and thus the piracy continued.
Furthermore, the penalties offered by the court until 2001 were negligible and did
not compensate the right holder adequately and lacked the deterrent effect. In
Nigeria, prior to the Copyright Act 1988, the criminal sanctions were provided for
in the Criminal Code49 and, like those of Kenya, were not punitive, remedial or
deterrent.50 In Uganda, the current Act does not criminalize copyright infringe-
ment. In Kenya, the Copyright Act provides for both criminal and civil sanctions.51
In Senegal, Chapter VII of the Copyright Act provides for both civil and criminal
sanctions. The system of enforcement is such that many people regard it as a cheap
penalty to pay for the disobedience of the law. The offender would happily pay the
requisite ﬁne and continue with the offending act.

The law has to provide the people with the reason to conform and if it lacks
this, then society is unlikely to adhere to the law. In the recent case of BMG Music v
Gonzales, the US Seventh Circuit Court awarded damages to the right holder for
end-user piracy. The defendant was an individual who downloaded music using the
Kazaa ﬁle-sharing system. Damages awarded amounted to US$22,500.52 The
damages seemed quite high for an individual end user but the case certainly sent
a message that illegal downloads of music would be and are punishable by law.
Once this message is clear to society, the incidence of copyright infringement
is likely to decrease as the risk of getting caught and ﬁned is a reality. It might
not necessarily put a stop to the infringing acts across the board but it will reduce
them.

Copyright infringement in music is not viewed as a serious offence both by the
law enforcement agencies and the users of copyright. This explains the dearth of
copyright infringement cases tried before the criminal courts or the suits that are
brought before courts. The law enforcement agencies ﬁnd it a minor offence and the
penalties awarded, if any, are nominal. Where the beneﬁts and convenience from
the infringements are high but the risk of retribution is low, most people will opt to
infringe the copyright.53

In some cases, society may view the copyright law as an impediment to the

dissemination of information.54

Technology
Available and emerging technology does, to a certain extent, affect the enforcement
of copyright especially in the music industry. Technology has, in the recent past,
developed faster than the law. In the early days before the printing press, enforce-
ment of copyright in literary works was not much of a problem because the
reproduction of texts involved the painstaking efforts of the copywriters and it
was not worth the effort. Advances in technology brought about problems of
enforcement. In the case of music, the signiﬁcant technological changes were the
advent of the gramophone, wireless radio, music cassettes and ﬁnally the digital
technologies. New technology facilitates the unauthorized reproduction, use and
communication of copyright-protected works at the national, regional and inter-
national level. Enforcement can no longer be restricted to national and regional
norms but has to be harmonized at the international level.55 Technology has made
copying of music fast and produces perfect copies retaining the original quality of
the music. Waiting for remedies to stop the infringement might not be practical.
Fast and expeditious remedies required by the TRIPS Agreement provide that the
right holder can get temporary relief prior to the court proceedings.56 New
technologies have also put the existing legal regime to test as it is deemed to be
insufﬁcient to deal with the infringements. It can be argued that, in the past,
copyright has always been adopted to cater for the emerging technological changes
as the basic principles remain the same. As to whether or not copyright is suitable
for copyright protection in the digital era is subject to a separate discussion, which
shall not be addressed in this article. The use of technological devices to enforce
copyright is a welcome idea as it helps in the enforcement over the digital networks
whereby, although the law does not allow unauthorized use, the users can access the
information anyway and store it. It will be quite a while before they are appre-
hended or, when they are caught, the damage has already been caused, as is the case
with the peer-to-peer ﬁle-sharing system.57

Technology can be a double-edged sword as it may be used to stop infringe-
ments and, at the same time, it may be used to facilitate the infringement. It is
interesting to note that in the current debate on digital copyright, most of sub-
Saharan Africa is excluded on the grounds that they do not have the infrastructure
to support the digital technologies. Infringement of copyright works over the digital
networks within the continent is now a reality and is affecting the various copyright
industries, especially the music industry.58 A good example of how technology can
impact on enforcement is the advent of the music cassette in the 1980s and,
subsequently, CDs and, ﬁnally, the peer-to-peer ﬁle-sharing system.

Prevailing Political and Economic Conditions

Before 1970, the enforcement of copyright in the DCs was not much of an issue.
This was largely due to the ‘‘dependency theory’’ that was used to support the DCs
argument that copying was part and parcel of the development process (Djaic, 2000,

r 2006 The Author. Journal Compilation r 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

p. 2). This was based on the argument used by the United States in 1886 when they
refused to sign the Berne Convention on the grounds that they were a DC and
needed access to knowledge.59 They further argued that protecting intellectual
property and enforcing the same in the DCs would amount to protecting foreign
works from the DCs. This, they argued, was not desirable as it only widened the
economic gap between the developing and developed countries. In a way, this will
explain the lack or minimum enforcement of copyright laws in DCs including sub-
Saharan Africa. In the 1970s, the situation changed and there was pressure from the
international community, namely the United States, for stronger intellectual
property laws and enforcement in Asia (Djaic, 2000). This pressure was in turn
directed at sub-Saharan Africa in the late 1980s and early 1990s. There are many
reasons that have been advanced for this change and Uphoff argues that there are
three main reasons. First, the increased literacy level increased the demands for
Western products such as books, ﬁlms and music, and the demand was higher than
the supply. The pirates simply ﬁlled the gap created by the prevailing market
conditions. Secondly, the advances in technology made copying easier and, after a
while, DCs especially in Asia were exporting the pirated books, music and ﬁlms to
other countries. Thirdly, the Third World countries, which were previously not on
the intellectual property map, were recognized as potential markets (Uphoff, 1991,
p. 7). These pirated goods found their way to markets in other DCs as they were
cheaper and more available than the original products. It is interesting to note that
the multinationals had previously ignored the DCs as they thought that the markets
were insigniﬁcant. The losses or perceived losses were enough to convince the
various governments for strong copyright laws and enforcement procedures by the
DCs. In order to understand the political and economic dynamics, we shall take
the example of the United States. In 2002, the copyright industries contributed
US$626.2 billion to the value of the US economy, which translates to about 5.98%
of the gross domestic product.60 The increased use of US copyright products in the
DCs prompted the industry to lobby the government for better protection of their
products in Third World countries. In 1984, the Tariff and Trade Act was enacted
by Congress in the United States. The Act allowed the United States to tie the
import privileges to the United States to the improved intellectual property systems
in the DCs. These were generally used against the DCs in Asia as they posed an
immediate threat to the copyright industries in the United States. In 1988, US
Congress introduced the ‘‘Super 301’’, which allowed the United States to draw up a
list of countries that would be put on the Watch List and threatened with economic
sanctions if they failed to comply (Djaic, 2000, p. 3). Kenya, Nigeria and South
Africa have all been named in the International Intellectual Property Alliance
(IIPA) as countries deserving special mention.61 This is meant to apply pressure on
the governments to come up with more efﬁcient intellectual property enforcement
mechanisms. The political and economic pressure for strong enforcement was
consolidated in the 1994 TRIPS Agreement, which made it mandatory for all
member states to provide for fast and efﬁcient enforcement of intellectual prop-

606

erty.62 As the possibility of missing out on trading privileges and the risk of
sanctions under the WTO, most DCs have reformed their laws and are trying to
put enforcement mechanisms in place. It seems though that the TRIPS Agreement
is not enough and countries like the United States are coming up with ‘‘TRIPS-
plus’’ provisions that are imposed on the DCs through the bilateral trade agree-
ments as well free trade agreements. This is because TRIPS only provides for
minimum standards.

Apart from international political and economic pressure, enforcement is also
determined by the local political will as well as the prevailing economic circum-
stances. The ability to provide the resources required to combat copyright infringe-
ment makes a difference with regard to enforcement of the rights. This depends on
several factors such as the cost of enforcement, the political will as well as the
availability of resources. Not much in terms of human resources and infrastructure
has been allocated for the enforcement of copyright. This can be traced to the lack
of policy on copyright in several developing nations.63 The strengthened legal
regimes would amount to nothing if there are no resources allocated for the actual
enforcement.64 The purchasing power of the end users or would-be end users and
the cost of the original product on the market contributes to the level of conformity
to the law. If the cost of the product is beyond the income of the users, there is a
likelihood that a black market for the pirated goods will appear, making the
likelihood of infringement higher and consequently increasing the cost of enforce-
ment. This will also be determined by consumer preferences and it ties in with the
point on the cost of sanctions in relation to the beneﬁt from the infringement.

The growth of the local music industries has also contributed to the increased
enforcement of the rights. Copyright is no longer seen as the preserve of foreign
works. The right holders within the local music industry have realized the need
for effective enforcement of copyright and have been quite instrumental in the
enactment of new copyright laws.65 The growing local music industry and the
increased regional and international trade in the same, has led sub-Saharan
countries realizing that there is a need for good enforcement of copyright for their
industries. The economic pressure for proper enforcement mechanisms is from both
within and beyond the national borders.

The analysis of factors that inﬂuence the enforcement of copyright and related

rights brings us to the laws and institutional enforcement structures.

Laws and Institutions as the Basic Enforcement Regime
on Music Copyright

The next issue is how the law ensures that these rights are not exploited by
unauthorized third parties. The law sets out what constitutes infringement and
makes it illegal and even creates offences that are punishable. The laws are executed
by various institutions known as the enforcement agencies, as discussed in the
preceding paragraphs. The rules in respect of the consequences for the various

infringing actions are jurisdictional. In the next paragraphs, we shall brieﬂy examine
the laws on enforcement of copyright and the domestic institutions that execute
these laws.

International Laws
For a very long time, the international copyright system was concerned with the
harmonization of substantive rules and standards, and the enforcement of copy-
right was treated as a domestic issue and was left to the various countries to set out
laws and determine the enforcement matters at the national level. The existing
international instruments such as the Berne Convention made speciﬁc provisions
especially with regard to seizure and not much on the enforcement of copyright at
the international level.66 This was the situation that prevailed until the TRIPS
Agreement, which had very clear provisions on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights. The aim of this section is to look at the existing international and
regional norms on enforcement. We will examine speciﬁc provisions contained in
various international and regional instruments as well as the current regional
structures within Africa and their policies on enforcement.

The Berne Convention did not make speciﬁc provisions with regard to
enforcement of copyright. There are, however, three provisions on the enforcement
of copyright in music. The ﬁrst one provides for the seizure of copies of certain
recordings of musical works imported without the author’s or assignee’s author-
ity.67 The author, under the law, has the exclusive rights to authorize the recording
of his works and the importation of the works into his country. If a third party,
without his authorization, brings in the sound recordings of his work, the author
has the right to have the copyright works seized. This provision, it may be assumed,
was made to cater for the cross-border issues among the member states and to
ensure that the works that were imported were legitimate. This did not allow the
parallel importation of the sound recordings as the right holder had full control of
the imports. This facilitated enforcement as the sound recordings that came in
without the right holder’s authority could be seized and any release into the
channels of commerce could be avoided. The second provision creates a presump-
tion of copyright ownership and the author has the right to institute proceedings
within the member countries of the Berne Union in the case of copyright infringe-
ment.68 This would provide the copyright owners with the right of audience to sue
and institute proceedings for infringement in the country where the infringement
occurred, as long as it was within the Berne membership. The third provision grants
the right to seize infringing works within the Berne member states, even if they are
no longer protected within their country of origin.69 This was quite a peculiar
provision given that the copyright subsists for a certain period of time and if it
expired it would apply to all the member states. This author has yet to ﬁnd the
rationale for this provision. The Berne Convention leaves the formulation of the
legislation and modalities to the member states with regard to the seizure of
infringing copies. Member states may adopt the necessary measures to ensure the

application of the Berne Convention by extension of their national law. This
omission created an interesting situation among the member states. First, the
enforcement was left to the various member states and invariably they each had
different enforcement laws and procedures. The copyright owners had to rely on the
principles of reciprocity and national treatment when it came to the infringement of
their rights in other member states. The enforcement was thus purely in the domain
of the national regimes. Secondly, there was lack of harmonization of enforcement
laws and procedures, that would have an effect on the music industry. This is due to
cross-border piracy.70 Thirdly, the convention did not create any obligation for the
member states to provide for enforcement. There were countries that simply did not
make speciﬁc enforcement provisions in their laws. The laws were limited to the
infringement provisions and the remedies therein.71

The Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) is very general. Article 1 of the
UCC contains a general obligation for contracting states to grant adequate and
effective protection for copyright. Just as in the Berne Convention, there are no
speciﬁc provisions on enforcement.

The protection granted by the Berne Convention was limited to the authors of
copyright works and did not extend to the performers, producers and broadcasting
organizations. The Rome Convention72 was an attempt to set out the minimum
international standards for the protection of related rights. Curiously, the conven-
tion did not make any speciﬁc provisions for the enforcement of the rights
contained therein. The convention, like the Berne Convention, requires the member
states to ensure that they have legal provisions to implement the convention
effectively.

Similar provisions can be found in the Phonograms Convention.73 There are
other conventions that deal with related rights.74 The Berne Convention and the
Rome Convention gave the minimum standards of protection and only bound the
member states.

The above conventions, it has been noted, made general but limited references
obliging members to enforce the protected rights (Abbot et al., 1999, p. 1569;
Sterling, 2003, at 14.02, p. 574). There was a reluctance to include the enforcement
provisions in the international conventions. This could be due to the different
copyright systems that existed at the time of drafting the conventions. The author’s
right system treated copyright as an extension of one’s persona, while the copyright
system viewed them as economic rights. The enforcement would thus be determined
by the various legal systems.

The existing international instruments did not contain speciﬁc provisions on
enforcement. With no international standards, the enforcement of copyright varied
from country to country. At the beginning of the last century, this was not much of
an issue as the various countries could enter into bilateral or multilateral agree-
ments with regard to the protection and enforcement of their respective rights.
There were two main factors that brought enforcement of intellectual property to
the international plane. One was the growth of international trade, especially in

intellectual property. The second was the advances in technology that enabled easier
dissemination of copyright-protected works over a larger geographical area. There
was a need to harmonize the laws in this regard; this was well addressed in the
TRIPS Agreement in 1994 (Sterling, 2003, at 432).

The enforcement of intellectual property rights was seen as one of the factors
behind the TRIPS negotiations (Abbot et al., 1999). The preamble to the TRIPS
Agreement states:

To reduce distortions and impediments to international trade, and
taking into account
the need to promote effective and adequate
protection of intellectual property rights and to ensure that measures
and procedures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves
become barriers to legitimate trade. It recognised the need for new rules
and disciplines concerning, among others . . .

. . . the provision of effective and appropriate means for the enforcement
of trade related intellectual property rights, taking into account
differences in national legal systems .. . .

The TRIPS Agreement brought intellectual property under the WTO. It
requires the WTO member states to adhere to the minimum standards of protection
set out by the existing laws and to provide for effective and expeditious remedies for
the infringement of intellectual property rights.75 It also establishes guidelines for
the civil and administrative remedies, criminal procedures, as well as the provisional
and border measures.76 TRIPS thus sets out more speciﬁc but detailed requirements
for the enforcement of intellectual property rights as a whole.77 Failure to imple-
ment the standards of enforcement set out by the TRIPS Agreement would subject
the member state to a complaint under the TRIPS settlement procedure. TRIPS is
non-prescriptive about the conditions for the granting of private rights but more
speciﬁc about the procedures for enforcing the rights and the permissible limitations
to the private rights to safeguard the public interest (Dreir, 1996). The effective
protection and enforcement is seen to be necessary for the growth and development
of intellectual property.78 One signiﬁcant provision is the availability of expe-
dient
judicial procedures available to the copyright holder pending trial.
These enable the right holder to stem off further violations while waiting for the
determination of the case.79 Rules on enforcement contained in the TRIPS
Agreement are subject to the general principles of fairness and equity (Dratler,
1999). The provisions on enforcement of intellectual property rights under the
TRIPS Agreement were not without shortcomings. First, the standards set out
were seen to be too broad and this, some scholars have argued, would result
in divergent interpretations. This is because the interpretation of the broad
standards is left to the national courts (Gervais, 2003). In effect, this would
result in divergent provisions within the various member states. Second, the
provisions were largely based on the United States standards and many countries,

especially DCs, are not familiar or do not have systems similar to the United
States. This applies in the case of the various types of injunctions, and pretrial
procedures. The third point relates to impact of the enforcement provisions in
DCs (Gervais, 2003). As the TRIPS Agreement was negotiated and based on the
pre-existing enforcement regimes in the United States, not much input was made
by the DCs and, in signing the treaties, they simply accepted the terms as set
out. This is with certain exceptions. Some concerns raised by the DCs were
accommodated including article 41(5) and article 46.80 Having the new enforcement

The TRIPS Agreement was negotiated in 1994, while there were other
technological advances taking place especially in the digital environment. There
were several issues that were not covered by the TRIPS Agreement such as the
digital rights management creating the need for the two World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) ‘‘Internet’’ treaties that were concluded in 1996 by the WIPO
Diplomatic Conference (Suthersanen, 2005). These were the WIPO Copyright
Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).
The two treaties made provisions for technological advances to protect works
especially in the digital environment. The current and emerging digital technologies
have made it possible to reproduce and distribute copyright works including music
via the Internet.82 The two treaties provide for technological protection measures
and electronic rights management information systems. These include provisions
against the circumvention of technological devices protecting legitimate copyright
works and provision of such technologies.83 Currently, there are 47 countries that
have ratiﬁed the WCT and 43 have ratiﬁed the WPPT.84 Kenya, Nigeria and South
Africa have not ratiﬁed the two treaties although they were involved in the
diplomatic conferences that drafted the treaties. They, however, have provisions
for the protection of rights management information systems and electronic rights
management systems.

Impact of International Laws on Domestic Legislation in Africa

In the history and development of copyright and related rights, the development of
international copyright law was more or less inﬂuenced by the existing domestic
law. This was the case with the Berne Convention, which sought to harmonize the
existing national laws in Europe at that time. The TRIPS Agreement is yet another
example of an international law that was inﬂuenced to a large extent by the existing
legal framework within the United States.85 The copyright laws of DCs, on the
other hand, were more or less inﬂuenced by the developments in international

copyright. Before the TRIPS Agreement, several countries were encouraged to join
the Berne Convention and ensure that their laws were in conformity. Although quite
a number of countries had some form of enforcement mechanisms in place, the
TRIPS Agreement ensured that they were within the minimum requirements. Several
countries came up with new copyright laws that had stronger enforcement provisions.
For instance, in addition to the civil and criminal procedures that were contained in
the 1966 Copyright Act of Kenya, the Copyright Act 2001 made provisions for
stronger administrative and enforcement structures. It created the Kenya Copyright
Board, which had an enforcement structure akin to the Nigerian Copyright Commis-
sion. Other countries such as Tanzania and Zimbabwe came up with new laws but the
enforcement provisions were similar to the previous laws, except for the stiffer
penalties and longer custodial sentences.86 Other laws had small or insigniﬁcant
changes as they already had the required provisions.87 Stronger laws and enforcement
mechanisms do not necessarily mean that there will be a higher degree of conformity
and less infringement, especially in the music industry. The law is just one step in the
process of ensuring the enforcement of copyright.

In the following section, we will brieﬂy look at the various enforcement
institutions that exist, both within the public and private sector. The institutions,
whether or not created by the law, are instrumental in the enforcement of the rights
as provided for by the law. The laws without the enforcement structures would be
redundant.88

Copyright Ofﬁce
The copyright ofﬁce is generally mandated to deal with the administration and
enforcement of copyright and related rights.89 One interesting feature about copy-
right ofﬁces is that they may be established under copyright laws within a particular
jurisdiction or they may exist without such a legal provision. In countries like
Canada, Malawi, Nigeria, the United States among others, copyright ofﬁces exist as
established by the law.90 Germany, France and the United Kingdom all have
copyright ofﬁces but they are not established by the copyright laws. There seems to
be no established pattern as countries from both copyright and author rights
systems either have them established under the law or not. This trend is also
noticeable in sub-Saharan Africa. In recent years, however, the amendments to the
laws or the enactment of new laws have included the establishment of copyright
ofﬁces. This is due to the fact that the ofﬁces existed without any deﬁnite status and
could be moved from one ministry or department to another.91 In such cases, it was
difﬁcult to establish capacity in these ofﬁces. It is important to study the role of the
copyright ofﬁces in relation to enforcement of copyright.

In many instances, the copyright ofﬁces established in Africa were a result of
the need for better administration of copyright and related rights. In Nigeria, for
instance, the Nigerian Copyright Commission was established to ensure the
effective administration and enforcement of copyright in response to the prevailing
needs within the copyright industry. The Commission is mandated to deal with

matters of copyright administration and enforcement. The enforcement is carried
out through the copyright inspectors who are appointed under the Copyright Act
and they have the powers to search and arrest, as well as carry out examinations and
inquiries. They also have the power to prosecute, conduct or defend a matter in
court.92 Recently, their powers were increased and now have similar powers and
privileges to a police ofﬁcer as deﬁned by the Police Act.93 The Nigerian experience
illustrates the role of the copyright ofﬁce especially in enforcement (Asein, 2003, pp.
201–6). A similar approach has been adopted by Kenya, which hopes to come up
with a similar structure.94 As the Board is not yet operational, the copyright ofﬁce
has to rely on the police to arrest and prosecute the copyright cases. Most countries
that inherited the copyright system did not provide for registration of copyright
works, which could explain the lack of interest in establishing copyright ofﬁces. The
ofﬁces did not exist and, where they did, they were small sections within the larger
government departments and poorly staffed. In French-speaking countries, some
countries, like Senegal, made clear provisions for copyright ofﬁces which, inter alia,
were mandated to ensure that the rights of the authors were protected and to
manage their rights collectively.95 This created ofﬁces with dual roles: the general
administration and enforcement of copyright and related rights, as well as collective
management. A similar situation pertains in Malawi. The enforcement roles of these
ofﬁces have not been very clear and not much has been done in terms of policy and
actual enforcement. It remains to be seen what kind of pressure will be applied by
the main producers of copyright works either through the TRIPS Agreement or the
TRIPS-plus measures to ensure that the member states of WTO, especially those in
sub-Saharan Africa, make provisions for the copyright ofﬁces or the establishment
thereof. This is because the copyright ofﬁces are essential, especially when it comes
to the formulation of enforcement policies as well as strategic planning. They also
act as the link between the other public enforcers and the private enforcement
agencies.

From the forgoing, we can see that the role of the copyright ofﬁces in
enforcement is mainly at the policy level as well as in creating an environment that
facilitates the enforcement of the rights. Copyright enforcement is carried out
together with the enforcement of other intellectual property rights. The enforcement
strategies deal with both counterfeiting and piracy.96

The Courts
The judiciary also plays an important role in the determination of both civil and
criminal cases on copyright and related rights. In some jurisdictions like the United
States and the United Kingdom, the judges are instrumental in the formulation of
copyright policy through their judgments.97 The judiciary is charged with the
execution of laws. The remedies available through the courts are wide and include
awards for damages, preliminary relief, injunctions, ﬁnes and custodial sentences.
The judges and magistrates need to be well versed in matters of copyright in order to
determine the cases effectively. In common law jurisdictions, the judgments of the

courts are binding on subsequent decisions. The civil law jurisdictions decide each
case according to the law and its merits, and previous judgments are not binding but
the courts do not deliberately go out of their way to give a ruling contrary to an
existing one. The right holder can either opt for civil
litigation or criminal
prosecution to enforce his rights. The role of the judiciary has been summed up
by Dr El Badrawi, as follows (El Badrawi, 2004):

The judicial authorities play a pivotal role in the general organisation of
modern societies. The more that role is efﬁcient, the more stability will
prevail and societal tensions diminish. Indeed, the role of the judiciary
consists in securing respect for and sufﬁcient enforcement of legislation
protecting rights and freedoms. It is not sufﬁcient that legislation
establishes
for
acquiring such rights (through procedural provisions) acquisition of
rights, regardless of the means of acquisition, must be guaranteed
through efﬁcient channels of justice controlled by a solid authority
capable of protecting the rights against violation or abuse.

(through substantive provisions) or means

rights

The role of the judiciary therefore cannot be underestimated in the enforcement
of intellectual property rights. The validity of intellectual property rights relies on
the performance of the judicial system. An effective judicial system is necessary to
ensure that the rights are secured, as rights without an effective remedy are of little
or no value (Sherwood, 1999).

Customs and Excise
New technologies, increases in international trade in intellectual property goods
and the availability of markets have affected the music industry both negatively and
positively. Countries like the United Kingdom, France and Germany, among
others, all have strong intellectual property regimes as well as enforcement
mechanisms. As pirates are at a higher risk of being apprehended in these countries,
they opt to move to other countries where the legal and enforcement regime is not
quite as strong. These pirated goods will eventually ﬁnd their way into the markets
through various means including the border points. If border enforcement is weak,
then the goods can easily ﬁnd their way into the market. The enforcement by the
Customs and Excise Department involves prevention of illegal or ‘‘uncustomed’’
goods from getting into the channels of commerce through the various border
points. Their enforcement activities include seizure of the infringing articles. In
many cases, they act in conjunction with the other law enforcement agencies such as
the police and the judiciary. They may also act on their own volition following the
discovery of any suspicious cargo.

Police
The police are normally helpful in the apprehension of copyright infringers and
arraigning them in court. Copyright infringement like any other crime can be
reported to the police, who will in turn try and apprehend the infringer and take him

to court. In some jurisdictions like Kenya, they are also responsible for the
prosecution of copyright cases in the lower courts. The police are also responsible
for executing the search warrants issued by the court. In some countries, they have
the power to arrest anyone whom they suspect of engaging in infringing activities,
without a court order. The police in general have the powers of arrest, search and
seizure, either with or without a search warrant depending on the circumstances.
For instance, if they see a person in the process of committing a crime, they have the
power to arrest the person there and then. In several DCs, the powers have hardly
been exercised in copyright infringement cases.

Bureau of Standards and Weights and Measures
The Bureau of Standards deals mainly with the enforcement of standards within the
particular country. They help in the enforcement of copyright through the vetting of
standards on the various sound recordings that come into the country. It is notable
that quite a number of pirated music cassettes and CDs and DVDs do not meet the
required quality standards and these can be prevented from getting into the
channels of commerce. The Bureau of Weights and Measures enforces the Trade
Descriptions Act. The two are departments within the Ministry of Trade and work
closely with the Customs Department and the police. The enforcement of copyright
using the Trade Descriptions Act has been quite successful in several countries. This
is because most infringing works do not comply with the standards set by the Act.
In Kenya, for example, one rights holder said that she was more successful with the
Trade Descriptions Act than the Copyright Act in catching the infringers.

CMO
CMO have the mandate to collect and distribute the royalties on behalf of their
members. They draw their mandate from the assignment of the performing rights
from the rights holders who make up their membership. The CMOs are well suited
to enforce the rights of their members and can institute legal proceedings against the
infringers. The users of copyright-protected music are expected to take out licences
for public performance and broadcasting through the CMOs as the individual
collection of the royalties would be very cumbersome.98 CMOs would normally
avoid using litigation for the enforcement of their members’ rights and opt for more
non-forceful methods such as negotiations and arbitration. This is due to the costs
of litigation and the length of time it would take to determine the cases. However,
there are circumstances where they are forced to go to court to enforce the rights as
the users such as the broadcasting organizations and owners of entertainment spots
refuse to pay for the licences. There are two main situations where the CMO can
institute litigation proceedings: ﬁrst, where the user has refused to take out a licence
and continues to use the protected music and secondly, where the licence has
expired and the user has refused to renew the licence.99 There are instances where
the CMO cannot or is not allowed to institute proceedings on behalf of the right
holders. This can either be a statutory provision or the right holder chooses to retain
the right to institute legal proceedings. A case in point is in the United Sates where

615

Marisella N. Ouma

neither the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) nor
Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) can sue an infringer in their own names.100
Other CMOs ensure that the enforcement of the rights is included in the
assignment of the rights or is clearly provided for in their memoranda and articles of
association depending on whether they are statutory bodies or government bodies,
private or quasi-government organizations.101 The CMOs may either institute the
proceedings in their own names or have the right holders enjoined as parties to the
suit or they may sue on behalf of the right holders. The ideal situation is where the
law or the articles of association provide that the CMO can bring the suit in its own
name.102 CMOs deal with litigation arising from unauthorized public performance
or broadcasting of the works as well as the reproduction and sale or distribution of
the unauthorized work. Once the cases have been instituted, the courts in ﬁnding for
the CMOs can, inter alia, award damages based on the royalties the infringer would
have paid had he taken out a licence, as was the case in Phonographic Performance
Ltd v Reader, where the complainant was awarded damages based on the royalties
the right holder would have secured had the defendant paid for the licence.103

From the foregoing, it should be noted that the CMOs play quite a big role in
the enforcement of copyright on behalf of its members. However, there are some
problems that are likely to arise especially in litigation where they do not have
tangible proof of the infringement. This would occur in the cases of live perfor-
mances and broadcasts. This is because they would normally rely on the returns
submitted by the users and, in certain cases, the users would refuse to hand over the
documents. In such cases, they would have to have the relevant court orders to
compel the users to produce the evidence,104 or they may employ the services of
inspectors or certiﬁed agents to support their allegations.105 On the other hand,
there are those who will argue that the mandate of the CMO does not go beyond
collecting and distributing the royalties on behalf of their members and doing so
would be exceeding their powers. But the failure to obtain a licence from the CMO
constitutes an infringement of copyright. The CMO can opt to enforce the right
through arbitration by the relevant bodies such as the copyright tribunals as
envisaged in the United Kingdom. It is largely assumed that these bodies are meant
to determine cases where the terms of the licences have not been agreed upon by the
user and the CMO. However, on a critical look at this, one will see that this
amounts to enforcement as the tribunal will determine the status of the licence.
Does this make the copyright tribunals enforcement agencies? This is an interesting
issue that would require further research.

Trade Unions
Trade unions within the music industry play a minor role in the enforcement of
copyright. They work together with the other enforcement agencies to try and
identify the infringing works. A good example is the Musicians Union of Ghana,
which works together with the copyright ofﬁce and the Internal Revenue Service in
enforcement through the anti-piracy security device. They help in the veriﬁcation or

authentication of the musician’s works before the device is afﬁxed on the sound
carrier.106

Other Industry-Based Organizations
There are other industry-based organizations that are established speciﬁcally to deal
with the enforcement of copyright and related rights. These are normally con-
stituted by the key players in the industry such as the record companies. They are
mainly involved in the monitoring and tracking of copyright infringers and
reporting to the relevant public agencies such as the police and the Customs
Department for further action. Notable industry-based organizations include the
IFPI, which has ofﬁces around the world and coordinates with the police and
customs to curb music piracy.107

Joint Enforcement Efforts
The joint enforcement efforts are probably some of the most efﬁcient ways of
enforcing copyright. Private/public partnerships are crucial to the enforcement of
copyright as they complement each other in different areas, especially in areas where
the other is more skilled or better resourced. In the United Kingdom, there are very
good examples of these partnerships. In 2001, the police, the British Phonographic
Industry (BPI) and IFPI shared intelligence that led to the apprehension and
conviction of two suspects who were involved in a major counterfeit CD operation
and credit card fraud.108 In the United States, the United States Patent and Trade-
mark Ofﬁce (USPTO) has established an Intra-Government Coordination Council
made up of industry, other government agencies and the various enforcement
agencies. The council aims to forge effective partnerships and to foster a better
understanding to facilitate effective enforcement.

Optimal Enforcement of Music Copyright

Having looked at the theoretical aspects of enforcement and the laws and institu-
tions that are involved in the enforcement of copyright, the next issue to be
addressed is that of optimal enforcement of copyright in the music industry in
Africa. The enforcement of copyright in the music industry in sub-Saharan Africa is
faced with various challenges that might deter the achievement of optimal enforce-
ment of copyright. Although several countries have copyright laws in place that deal
with both the infringement and penalties, they are rarely utilized.109 Very few of the
cases are brought to court because of various factors such as the cost of ﬁling a civil
suit and the length of time it takes to determine the suit. This can also be attributed
to the reluctance of the police to pursue criminal
infringement cases. Other
challenges include the limited resources in both the public and private sector and
the lack of political will.

In theory, it is possible to have optimal enforcement. The optimal enforcement
of copyright will require a system that ensures the highest conformity to the law of
copyright and related rights through the following:

(i) an enforcement system that provides for both criminal and civil enforcement

of copyright and related rights;
a public enforcement system that is knowledgeable in matters of copyright
and related rights and includes the judiciary, customs and police, as well as
the copyright ofﬁces;
a well-informed public is also necessary as they are the ones who use the
music so they need a positive perception of copyright and related rights and
the need to have maximum adherence to the law;
the criminal penalties such as ﬁnes and custodial sentences need to be revised
to ensure that they are punitive and deterrent. Care should be taken so that
the penalties are not too harsh to the extent that they are counter-productive;
the procedures for enforcement such as the civil and administrative proce-
dures should be simple and effective;
the coordination between the public sector and the private is important. This
is because each sector has different resources or expertise that the other does
not possess and when combined can result in higher levels of enforcement;
the training of enforcement agencies on copyright and enforcement is crucial.

Conclusion

The optimal enforcement of copyright is dependent on various factors and this is
not restricted into the legal and institutional framework. Stronger laws do not
necessarily translate into efﬁcient enforcement. Effective enforcement involves a
constant review of the current procedures and the adaptation to deal with the
methods devised by the infringers to circumvent the law. An efﬁcient law-enforce-
ment system would produce any given level of deterrence with whatever combina-
tion of public and private enforcement is available. The cost of deterrence should
not exceed the beneﬁts to be accrued by the right holder.

3 Roscoe Pound (1917) summed this up as follows: ‘‘For laws do not execute themselves.
Human beings must execute them and there must be some motive setting the individual
in motion to do this above and beyond the abstract content of the rule and its conformity
to an ideal justice or an ideal social interest’’.

4 Copyright laws have been in place in most of Sub-Saharan Africa since the advent of the
colonial era. For most countries, the copyright owners have not beneﬁted form the laws
as they have not been enforced. In countries like Uganda, people even assume that there
is no copyright law as the Copyright Act 1964 is considered outdated and is not used.

section 18 of the Copyright Act of Nigeria, article 46 of the Copyright Act of Senegal,
article 93 of the Copyright Act of Mali, section 26 of the Copyright Act of South Africa. It
is important to note that in breach at civil law jurisdictions, the breach of copyright is
criminalized, through the Penal Code, while under common law jurisdictions, the criminal
infringement is provided within the Copyright Act without reference to the Penal Code.

7 For further discussion, see the positivist and naturalist approach to law.
8 The recent US case of copyright infringement through the use of the peer-to-peer ﬁle-

sharing system is a good example. The defendant claimed that the copies were
downloaded for the purposes of sampling to enable him to choose what to purchase. The
court, in rejecting this defence, found in favour of the claimant and awarded damages to
the tune of US$22,500: BMG Music v Gonzalez (Unreported) 27 October 2005, Seventh
Circuit US.

9 Section 11 of the Copyright Act of Uganda 1964 provides for civil remedies in case of
copyright infringement. It does not criminalize copyright infringement. The Act does not
set any maximum or minimum penalties and the damages are to be determined by the
court.

10 In most jurisdictions, however, copyright is in nature a tort, save for the criminal

offences created by the various copyright laws.

11 In the European Union, although the laws provide for both civil and criminal sanctions,

there is usually a difﬁculty in drawing the line between the two. In most of the
jurisdictions, intellectual property infringement is considered a civil breach. Criminal
sanctions will be reserved for cases of severe breaches; see Lowe (2004).

12 According to Steven Shavell (2003), sanctions for criminal offences include

imprisonment, various other non-monetary sanctions, ﬁnes and social sanctions
associated with being labelled a criminal; see NBER working paper series.

13 Typical civil remedies available under the English law for copyright infringement are
injunctions, damages or account for proﬁts and delivering up of infringing articles. In
criminal infringement cases, the laws provide for ﬁnes, Imprisonment, limited amount of
compensation and delivering up of infringing copies: section 108 of the Copyright
Designs and Patent Act 1988; see Harbottle (1998), at 2.

14 Uganda Copyright Act 1964; there is currently a pending Bill on copyright but it is yet to
be deliberated in Parliament. The new Bill seeks to include the new penalties in line with
the TRIPS Agreement.

15 In most developing countries, the defendants would in several instances use other tactics
to avoid paying the damages. For instance, they would apply for bankruptcy or wind up
the company before the case is concluded and the right holder is left with no possibility
of recovering the damages. This happened in the Kenyan case of Microsoft v Microskills
Civil Case Number 323 of 1999 (unreported).

16 In Kenya for instance, the pecuniary jurisdiction determines which court is likely to hear
the case. The High Court will only give audience to cases with a pecuniary jurisdiction of
certain value. Most of the copyright cases have invariably landed in the lower courts. In
the case of criminal prosecutions, they are tried by police prosecutors who are not well
versed in copyright matters and, as we shall see, this has a negative effect on the
enforcement of copyright, especially in the music industry.

They should thus be targeted at those thought to be judgment proof.

27 Stephenson’s (1994, p. 96) paper focuses more on enforcement federal laws in the United

States and with a speciﬁc interest in environmental laws. The literature is, however,
relevant to the research as he deals with pertinent issues with regard to private
enforcement of law, which can be applied to copyright and related rights.

28 See International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reports. Available at

hhttp://www.ifpi.orgi. The raids conducted in South Africa came up after the IFPI
informed the police and customs ofﬁcials on the consignment. The infringing
conﬁnement might have been able to get through customs and into the market
undetected by the public agencies; see Stephenson (1994, p. 108) and Cohen and Rubin
(1985, p. 167).

29 Stephenson (1994, p. 109). Stephenson further argues that ‘‘if enforcement were an

undifferentiated public good, citizen suits would be more efﬁcient because those parties
that value public good more highly than the median voter could supplement the
resources devoted to enforcement with private resources, but ultimately rejecting the
premise that enforcement is an undifferentiated public good’’. He also argues that
‘‘another problem with this argument is that, to the extent that enforcement is a public
good, there is still the free rider problem, as those private parties that desire a higher level
of enforcement than that provided by the public agency have an incentive to let other
private plaintiffs with similar preferences take the lead in bringing private suits’’. To read
further on the problem of the free rider, see Olson (1965).

Certain ends are desirable; certain values ought to be preserved; the law is the instrument
by which society preserves and enlarges its values. A society comes to be what it is as a
consequence of beliefs about what ought to be’’; see Thomson (1964).

to note that developing countries have recently developed vibrant copyright industries
such as books, ﬁlms (see the Nigerian ﬁlm industry) as well as the music industry. They
are now producers of copyright works.

affected the music industry in Kenya as the unauthorized sale and use of Kenyan music
in Uganda thrived. The Kenyans could only take action once the infringing items were
within the Kenyan borders. The result was the creation of a haven for pirates in Uganda
to the detriment of the Kenyan copyright owners. See report on piracy measures,
Copyright Section, Ofﬁce of the Attorney General (unpublished but on ﬁle with the
author), 2002.

71 See the Kenya Copyright Act 1966, Chapter 130 of the laws of Kenya (now repealed),

Copyright Act 1964 of Uganda and the Copyright Act of Nigeria.

72 The International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of

Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations (Rome, 1961).

74 See document by the International Bureau of WIPO, Basic Notions of Neighbouring

Rights—International Conventions in the Field of Neighbouring Rights
WIPO/CR/GE/93/3.

75 Article 41(1). However, the member states are not obliged to provide separate judicial
systems for the enforcement of intellectual property rights. Article 41 also provides that
the enforcement procedures should be fair and equitable.

76 Articles 42–61.
77 Part III of the Agreement deals with the enforcement of copyright and related rights

within the member countries. These provisions are either mandatory or optional.
Members are free to provide measures stronger than the TRIPS Agreement.

78 Article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement. The protection and enforcement of intellectual

property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the
transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of the producers and
users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic
welfare, and to balance the rights and obligations. Article 8, Principles. (1) Members may
in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures to protect public
health and nutrition, and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to
their social economic and technological development, provided that such measures are
consistent with the provisions of the Agreement. (2) Appropriate measures, provided they
are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, may be needed to prevent the abuse
of intellectual property rights by right holders or the resort to practices that unreasonably
restrain the trade or adversely affect the international transfer of technology.

79 In common law jurisdictions, the Anton Piller Orders are available, while in the civil law

systems the saise-contrafac¸ on procedure is available.

80 Article 41(5) places no obligation on the member states to set-up separate curts for the

determination of intellectual property cases. Article 46, which makes reference to
existing constitutional requirements and had been requested by Brazil.

Optimal Enforcement of Music Copyright

81 A similar opinion was expressed by Sterling (2003).
82 MP3, Napster and other peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing have made it possible to copy and

distribute music works via the Internet.

83 Articles 11 and 12 of the WCT and articles 18 and 19 of the WPPT. For further reading,

see Sterling (2003, at 14.03).

85 For more on the same, see Gervais (2003).
86 Tanzania Copyright Act 1999, Zimbabwe 1999.
87 Nigeria, South Africa and Malawi.
88 This has been the case in countries such as Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Uganda, Mali

and Senegal, among others.

89 The Copyright Ofﬁce within the Library of Congress in the United States is clearly

established by the Copyright Act. Other established copyright ofﬁces include the
Copyright Ofﬁce within the UK, Patent Ofﬁce, the Nigerian Copyright Commission, the
Copyright Society of Malawi and the Kenya Copyright Board.

90 In Canada, the Registrar of Copyrights is established under section 48 of the

Canadian Copyright Act. In the United States, chapter 7 of the US Copyright Act 1976
provides for the administration of copyright and related rights by the Copyright
Ofﬁce within the Library of Congress. Section 30 of the Nigeria Copyright Act also
provides for the Nigeria Copyright Commission, which is charged with the responsibility
of administration and enforcement of copyright; see Mali and Senegal as well as section
3 of the Kenya Copyright Act of 2001.

91 A good example is Ghana where the ofﬁce was moved from various government

departments over the years. In Kenya, the copyright ofﬁce, before the enactment of the
Copyright Act 2001, was always a section within the larger Department of the Registrar
General and this was not a very desirable state and it did affect enforcement and
administration of copyright.

92 See section 32A.
93 Section 32A(5).
94 Part V of the Copyright Act 2001 provides for inspection and the appointment of

inspectors by the Board who shall have police powers. As the Board is yet to be
operational, the Copyright Ofﬁce has to rely on the police to arrest and prosecute the
copyright cases.

95 Articles 1 and 2, Law No. 72-40 Copyright Act of Senegal.
96 Notably, in the United Kingdom, there is a patent enforcement group that looked into

the issue of patent enforcement and a report was released in June 2004. For more
information on the same, See the website available at hhttp://www.patent.gov.uk/about/
