The Microsoft decision: a setback to IP rights
in Europe?
Sujitha Subramanian*

Background
In September 2007, the Court of First Instance (CFI)
handed down its judgment in Microsoft v Commission
upholding the European Commission’s
(EC) 2004
decision.1 The contested decision was based on three
Statements of Objections served on Microsoft following a
complaint made by Sun Microsystems in 1998 and as a
result of investigation commenced of the EC’s own voli-
tion. The Statement of Objections raised questions con-
cerning the
interoperability of Windows Personal
Computer Operating System (PCOS) and other suppliers’
Work Group Server Operating Systems (client-to-server
interoperability),
interoperability between work group
servers (server-to-server interoperability), and ‘tying’ of
Windows Media Player to Windows PCOS.2 The con-
tested decision found and the CFI conﬁrmed that Micro-
soft had infringed Article 82 of the EU Treaty by abusing
its dominance in the Windows PCOS market by refusing
to supply to its competitors ‘interoperability information’,
which disrupted previous levels of supply and created a
risk of elimination of effective competition in the Work
Group Server OS market, thus having a negative impact
on technical development and consumer welfare.3 Micro-
soft was required to disclose complete and accurate tech-
nical information on reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms which would allow non-Microsoft Work Group
Servers to achieve full
interoperability with Windows
PCOS and servers, enabling them to viably compete with
Microsoft’s products in the relevant market.

Microsoft argued that their technologies were pro-
tected by IP rights; if these were compulsorily licensed,

this would reduce not only their own incentive to
invest in research and development (R&D), but also
competitors’
incentives since the latter could simply
wait for technology to be provided to them by domi-
nant ﬁrms.4 The EC denied the presence of IP rights
but, since they proceeded on the presumption that
Microsoft could rely on them by adopting the ‘strictest
legal test’ in their analysis and hence the one ‘most
favourable to Microsoft’, the CFI did not adjudicate on
the question of existence of IP rights.5 The EC main-
tained that licensing would promote competition in the
market which ‘will lead to more innovation and give
consumers more choices and better-priced products’.6
Though the basic principles of IP law and competition
law seem to be complementary in that both aim at pro-
moting the incentive to innovate, it cannot be denied
that their short-term goals conﬂict: while competition
policy encourage ﬁrms to compete in the market, IP
law grants the right-holder the exclusive use of his
intellectual asset.

insufﬁcient

Given that

innovation can adversely
affect productivity in the economy and ultimately be
detrimental to consumer welfare, the ruling can have a
wide impact on the legal, economic, and technological
environment of high-tech Europe. This case can aptly
be presented as ‘Innovation v Innovation’ since it has
brought into sharp focus the need to balance IP and
competition law in order to create and maintain an
innovation climate in Europe.

This article argues that Article 82 has been stretched
to incorporate Microsoft’s conduct within its sphere of
inﬂuence. This is because initially the Magill ruling held
refusal to license IP abusive only under ‘exceptional cir-
cumstances’ such as the prevention of the emergence of
a new product for which there was consumer demand—
which was not being satisﬁed by the right-holder.7 IMS
Health expanded this position such that refusal
to
license IP was to be deemed abusive if it prevents the
emergence of a new product which would be a substitut-
able product competing with the product provided for
by the right-holder.8 The instant case has
further
expanded this position by holding that the refusal to
license IP rights can be held illegal even if the grant of
licence could result in the creation of similar or even
identical products or services as that already provided
for by the right-holder.9 Though the CFI expressed its
faith in competitors using the information for technical
development, there is no positive obligation on the com-
petitors to produce follow-on innovation.

Following Microsoft, the EC published a Discussion
Paper on the Application of Article 82 EC Treaty to
exclusionary abuses.10 In December 2008, public consul-
tation on this paper led to the EC publishing guidance
in the application of Article 82 to abusive exclusionary
conduct by dominant undertakings.11 These state that
the EC will consider practices as an enforcement priority
if the refusal relates to a product or service that is objec-
tively necessary to be able to compete effectively on a
downstream market, where refusal is likely to lead to the
elimination of effective competition on a downstream
market and if the refusal is likely to lead to consumer
harm.12 Referring to Microsoft, the Guidelines clariﬁed

that such a product could be objectively necessary even
if competitors could enter or compete in the market
without the referred input. Additionally, though consu-
mer harm is not clearly identiﬁed, it includes the situ-
ation wherein refusal could affect competitors who
‘intends to produce new or improved goods or services
for which there is a potential consumer demand or is
likely to contribute to technical development’.13 From this
perspective, Microsoft can have a severe impact on domi-
nant ﬁrms especially when relying on IP rights obtained
through signiﬁcant investment in R&D.14 This paper
argues that Microsoft may indicate that the absence of
Community harmonization of IP laws in all areas and
the consequent lack of an IP institution equivalent to
DG Competition has resulted in competition law being
able to chip away some of the classical privileges of IP
rights granted by national laws in Europe.

This article covers (i) the discord between IP rights
and competition policy in Europe, examining the
concept of refusal to license IP rights under Article
82; (ii) how Article 82 has been ‘stretched’
to ﬁt
Microsoft’s conduct under the label of
‘abuse’; (iii)

ability information necessary to ensure effective com-
petition in the market (including how the judgment

In Europe, IP law is represented as a bundle of frag-

each of which authorizes the IP holder to exclude third
parties from using, exploiting, or commercializing an
intellectual asset for a certain duration. Article 295 of
the EU Treaty protects these rights by prohibiting the
prejudice of
the system of property ownership in
Member States. This led to IP rights being regarded as
an ‘inconvenience’ in the early stages of the European
market integration and as a way by which companies

might partition the common market to prevent free
movement of goods.15 Cases
such as Consten &
Grundig and Centrafarm16 got past
the hurdle of
Article 295 by developing a distinction between the
existence of the speciﬁc subject matter of the IP right,
which was immune to challenge by the rules on free
movement of goods, and the exercise of
IP rights
whereby ancillary or peripheral rights and privileges
could be challenged and negated if they injured the
cause of Community goals.17 This theory is encapsu-
lated in the now well-known principle of exhaustion,
whereby once a product is placed on the Community
market within one Member State either by or under
the authority of the IP holder, he is prevented from
relying on his IP rights to restrict its entry into other
States.18 However, the conﬂict between IP law and
competition policy, especially in areas other than paral-
lel import and distribution issues, remained unexplored
until the 1980s.

Volvo v Veng is one of the ﬁrst leading cases when
the Court considered whether a refusal to license an IP
right could be held to be ‘abusive’ under Article 8219 of
the EU Treaty, which prohibits abuse of dominant pos-
ition within the common market in so far as it may
affect trade between Member States. Though undertak-
ings are under no duty to deal with or supply to com-
petitors, such refusal by dominant ﬁrms can hinder the
competition process by limiting competitors’ pro-
duction, markets, or technical development.20 Refusal
to license can have the consequence of prejudicing con-
sumer welfare especially if the dominant ﬁrm controls
a ‘bottleneck’ facility resulting in competition in down-
stream market being eliminated due to foreclosure.21 In
the case of refusal to license an IP right, the presence of
IP does not bring with it a presumption that the right-

holder is dominant. Nor is the right-holder obliged to
offer justiﬁcation for his refusal since the right to grant
a licence is considered to be the speciﬁc subject-matter
of IP right and thus beyond the purview of the compe-
tition authority.22

In Volvo v Veng, the Court found that ‘the right of
the proprietor of a protected design to prevent third
parties from manufacturing and selling or importing
without its consent, products incorporating the design
constitutes the very subject-matter of his exclusive right’.23
It further clariﬁed that a refusal to license despite an
offer of reasonable royalty would not constitute abuse
of a dominant position within the meaning of Article
82.24 The Court set a precedent that, while mere refusal
to license is not ‘abusive’, certain additional
factors
could convert
refusal and make it
abusive.25 Though the Court did not ﬁnd that Volvo
practised such conduct and therefore found no abuse
of its dominant position, academics consider the rider
in the judgment to be an indication of the court’s will-
ingness to use competition law to place restraints on IP
rights.26 Magill and IMS Health, however, set out the
foundational principles for refusal to license IP rights
in the context of Article 82.

Ireland and the UK. At the time, each company pub-
lished guides that contained only the listings for their
own channels; consumers had to purchase several
guides to plan their week’s television viewing.28 Advo-
cate-General Gulmann opined that it would be appro-
priate to ﬁnd refusal abusive only when it prevented
the emergence of a product which did not compete
with the copyright owner’s product.29 He cautioned
that:

The ECJ stated that ‘exceptional circumstances’ could
convert the refusal to license IP into abusive conduct
under Article 82.31 The circumstances that the Courts
took into account to order compulsory licensing were
that the refusal concerned a product, the supply of
which was indispensable to the secondary market and
that the right-holders prevented the emergence of a
new product which was not being offered to the
public by the right-holder even though there was
‘speciﬁc, constant and regular potential demand’ for
it.32 The Court also held that the refusal was not
objectively justiﬁed as the refusal resulted in the elim-
the dominant
ination of all competition such that
undertaking could reserve the secondary market
to
itself.33 Academics were consoled by the fact that the
copyrights compulsorily licensed in the Magill case
did not involve creativity as the copyright in the list-
ings was not obtained for ‘creative effort’ and in any
case the listing were not copyrightable in continental
Europe.34

taken in Magill, but it was extended a bit further. IMS

brick structure’) wherein the territory of Germany was
divided into 1860 zones grouping doctors, patients, and
pharmacies so as to allow reporting of pharmaceutical
sales data in a way that is useful for calculating the com-
pensation of pharmaceutical company sales representa-
tives. When two former
IMS-personnel established
competing companies NDC and AyzX in the German
market, IMS sought to prevent them from using the brick
structure by successfully ﬁling a copyright infringement
claim in the Frankfurt District Court. NDC approached
the EC claiming that the refusal infringed Article 82, fol-
lowing which the EC adopted an interim measure order-
ing IMS Health to license its competitor to use the brick
structure in return for reasonable royalties.35

facto industry standard and surrounding circumstances
such as legal uncertainty and injunction order by
Frankfurt District Court presented ‘signiﬁcant obstacle’
and ‘gravely limited’ competitors from creating alterna-
tive marketable brick structure.36 The brick structure
was held to be indispensable to carrying on business on
the relevant market because there was no actual or
potential substitute. The EC found that there was no
objective justiﬁcation for refusing to grant the licence
which would result in elimination of all competition in
the market. The refusal was found to create a risk of

to competitors and

Meanwhile, the Frankfurt District Court requested a
ruling from the ECJ on issues relating to the copyright
infringement and violation of Article 82. Following an
action brought by IMS Health, the President of the CFI
ordered suspension of operation of the EC decision
pending a substantive determination by the CFI.38
NDC’s appeal against this order was dismissed by the
ECJ.39 Subsequently, the EC withdrew its decision on
the basis that NDC had begun to market a brick-struc-
ture which met customers’ needs and there was no
further urgency to impose interim measures.40

When the ECJ issued its opinion in IMS Health, it con-
ﬁrmed Magill in that a refusal to license an IP right
owned by a dominant undertaking which is indispensable
to its competitors would constitute an abuse within
Article 82 EC under exceptional circumstances.41 It stated
that the Magill criteria were ‘cumulative’ and satisfying
the same would be sufﬁcient to ﬁnd abuse.42 These
include the ﬁnding that the refusal to supply the indis-
pensable product must prevent the emergence of a new
product; that it result in the exclusion of all competition
on a secondary market and that the refusal is not objec-
tively justiﬁed. While in Magill, the criteria related to the
emergence of a new product which was not being offered
to the public by the right-holder even though there was
‘speciﬁc, constant and regular potential demand’ for it, in
IMS Health, the ECJ allowed the new product condition
to be satisﬁed even if it competes with the right-holder’s
products in the secondary market as substitutes.43

Stretching Article 82 to ﬁt Microsoft’s
conduct

thus making it
Microsoft decision in March 2004,
awkward for the EC to justify the contested decision in
light of the criteria stated in IMS Health. This was
especially with regard to the condition that refusal to
license an IP right should result in depriving the consu-
mers of a new product. The EC, however, insisted that
IMS Health did not establish an exhaustive list of excep-
tional circumstances: the Court had merely established a
list of criteria which were ‘sufﬁcient’ to satisfy a ﬁnding of
abusive conduct.44 The EC took the stand that the
present problem must not automatically be assessed
against the criteria established by IMS Health. This would
be ‘problematic’ since it would not include ‘the entire
range of factors surrounding that refusal and in particular
the economic and regulatory background to it’.45

There is little doubt that the case involves several
levels and layers of complexities, but what is unsettling
is the fact that the CFI hardly put to the test the tech-
nical and economic analysis put forth by the EC as it
felt that it did not have the ability to substitute its own
assessment for that of the EC.46 The CFI conﬁrmed
that
the Community Courts can carry out only a
limited review of complex technical and economic
assessments made by the EC.47 The limitation extends
to checking compliance with applicable procedural
rules, whether the facts have been accurately stated and
whether there has been any manifest error of assess-
ment or a misuse of power.48 Conﬁrming that the EC
had a margin of appreciation in economic or technical
matters, the CFI stated that the EC’s interpretation of
these data would be reviewed by seeking to establish if
the evidence put forth by the EC was factually correct,
reliable, and consistent.49

The standard of review applied by the CFI may have
been a ‘signiﬁcant driver of the outcome’.50 Despite
hoping
that Community Courts would conduct
‘searching inquiries into the soundness of the EC’s

decisions, even in complex cases’,51 Microsoft’s attempt
to get a balanced review of economic appraisals was
‘doomed’52 from the start. Indeed, after stating the EC
and Microsoft’s
the judgment
mainly agreed with the EC’s analysis and ‘interpret-
ations’ on almost all points of dispute while on various
occasions it stated that Microsoft’s assertions were
‘purely one of terminology and [hence] wholly irrele-
vant’;
‘purely formal and must be
rejected’;
‘purely semantic and cannot be accepted’;
‘unfounded and . . . based on a selective and inaccurate
reading of the contested decision’; ‘vague, general and
theoretical’, etc.53 It is submitted that the CFI failed to
consolidate its precedents and ‘tweaked’ each individual
component of the IP test in ways which will ‘signiﬁ-
cantly ease the investigatory burden on regulators in
future refusal-to-license cases’.54

‘scarcely credible’;

Indispensability
Microsoft objected to the indispensability test on the
basis that there was no causal link between the inability
to access its technology and the ‘supposed inability of
competitors to remain viably on the market’, alleging
that the EC used an inappropriate, extraordinary, and
absolute standard when examining whether competi-
tion could exist.55 When considering the interim appli-
cation,
there were serious
disputes
in relation to indispensability within the
meaning of prior case law.56 In the ﬁnal judgment, the
CFI upheld the EC ﬁnding that disclosure of the inter-
operability information was indispensable to enable
Microsoft’s competitors to compete with Microsoft in
an economically viable manner.57 Non-disclosure of
the interoperability information was found by the
EC to have an impact on the efﬁciency with which

the CFI recognized that

competitors could deliver their services to users of the
network thus having the potential to reinforce Micro-
soft’s competitive position.58

When assessing indispensability, as competition on
the basis of separate facility is ‘always’ preferred—
access is not ordered if a second facility could be built
and the indispensability criterion is not satisﬁed if
alternatives are available even if they were less advan-
tageous.59 For example, although it was not economic-
ally viable for a small newspaper to set-up its own
nationwide delivery system, Oscar Bronner ruled that
there were no technical, legal, or economic obstacles
capable of making it impossible, or even unreasonably
difﬁcult for other publishers of daily newspapers to
establish, alone or in cooperation with other publishers
its own nationwide home-delivery scheme.60 Advocate
General Jacobs stated: ‘ . . . the mere fact that by retain-
ing a facility for its own use, a dominant undertaking
retains advantage over a competitor cannot
justify
requiring access to it’.61 As long as competitors could
reproduce the relevant
facility or product, or ﬁnd
reasonable ways to get around it, the need to encourage
investment and innovation requires competition autho-
rities to desist from compulsorily licensing IP rights as

However,

in Microsoft, as the Windows domain
architecture was found to be the de facto standard for
work group computing in the market, the CFI held
that, if the existing degree of interoperability affects the
operator’s viability to remain on the market, it follows
that maintenance of effective competition on that
market
is hindered: this is abusive since dominant
undertakings have a special responsibility not to allow

that ‘the overall effect of the new court will be to review the Commission’s
economic assessments and ﬁndings of fact more critically and more clearly
than the Court has done until now.’].

their conduct ‘to impair genuine undistorted compe-
tition on the common market’.64 Thus in the ﬁnal
ruling,
the CFI rejected Microsoft’s assertions and
maintained that Microsoft had incorrectly interpreted
the scope of interoperability information required by
the EC.65 What is interesting is that, despite admitting
that the economic analysis is subject only to a limited
review by the Court, the case extended the indispensa-
bility criterion from being a technical objective cri-
terion to that of a test based on an appreciation of
‘economic viability’ which presupposed an analysis of a
complex economic character.66 The third section in this
paper explores further the difﬁculties in identifying the
degree of interoperability that is objectively necessary
to ensure that effective competition is maintained in
the market.

‘New’ product
One of the conditions for ﬁnding abuse of dominance
according to Magill and IMS Health is that refusal to
supply must result in the prevention of the appearance
of a new product. The EC asserted that competitors will
use the interoperability information to market improved
products and ‘offer . . . added value over their own and
Microsoft’s previous offerings’.67 Microsoft disputed that
making additional features to a competitors’ product
cannot be viewed as the creation of a new product.68

The CFI examined the criterion for loss of new
product in reference to the prohibition stated in Article
82(b) EC and since ‘numerous different implemen-
tations of the same speciﬁcations’ were possible, Micro-
soft’s conduct was held to affect ‘follow-on innovation’,
limiting technical development to the prejudice of consu-
mers.69 The Court, however, did not impose a positive
obligation on Microsoft’s competitors to innovate by
using information which had been compulsorily
licensed from Microsoft.

Secondly, it is not clear as to what exactly will con-
stitute ‘technical development’.70 The CFI did not

the CFI

specify what new products were likely to emerge due to
supply of the interoperability information. Paradoxi-
cally,
found Microsoft’s argument vague,
general and theoretical precisely for the reason that
they failed to specify the exact technology or product
that would be affected following compulsory disclos-
ure.71 To this extent, it is interesting that the lack of
clarity on CFI’s part in deﬁning what constitutes tech-
nical development
in order to be assessed as new
product is proportional to the alleged lack of clarity in
Microsoft’s argument that their incentive to innovate
will be affected if they were forced to grant access to
their competitors.

Instead of distinguishing Microsoft

from previous
cases, the CFI chose to widen the precedent by stating
that the appearance of a new product as envisaged in
Magill and IMS Health ‘cannot be the only parameter
which determines whether a refusal to license an intel-
lectual property right is capable of causing prejudice to
consumers’.72 Currently the ‘new product’ criterion
includes any IP right held by a dominant undertaking
as long as the IP right is not entirely devoid of com-
mercial value—especially in high-technology markets.
It can also be argued that the EC and CFI are moving
towards rules prohibiting refusal to license IP rights
which will affect markets for technologies that do not
yet exist. This is reminiscent of the ‘innovation market’
rules which the US authorities considered in the 1990s
when the Federal Trade Commission suggested that a
company could not assert its IP right in such a way
that it could affect development in a related market
which is potential or notional.

Objective justiﬁcation
Given that a ‘new product’ requirement was found
necessary only in IP-related abuse of dominance pre-
cedents, Microsoft argued that its refusal to supply the
information was objectively justiﬁed as it held IP rights
over the disputed technology.73 Microsoft asserted that

it claimed that

compulsory licensing would prejudice its incentives to
innovate as it would have to share the fruits of its R&D
with its competitors who would use the technology to
compete with its own product.74 Having made signiﬁ-
cant investment in designing its communication proto-
cols,
its
innovation was a just reward.75 Microsoft complained
that EC’s balancing test, where negative impact of an
access order on Microsoft’s incentive to innovate was
found to be outweighed by positive impact on the level
of innovation in the whole industry—was vague and
gave no indication as to how it was applied in the

the balancing test is a complex task and is not compul-
sory,
it has proved to be important when making
determinations involving IP rights.77 Interestingly, the
CFI did not engage in a balancing test but merely
reviewed the validity of Microsoft’s complaints, conclud-
ing that the mere existence of IP rights cannot constitute
an objective justiﬁcation; otherwise, the rationale of the
exception would be meaningless. The interim judgment
did not indicate that the assertion of IP right was insuf-
ﬁcient
to constitute an objective justiﬁcation for a
refusal to supply, thus causing Microsoft to announce
that it had ‘substantial cause for optimism’ as part of
the decision had ‘addressed the merits of the case’.78

instead of undertaking their own innovative activity to
avoid being ‘left behind’, would rather wait to obtain
access under Article 82.79 Intriguingly, the CFI took
into consideration that the competitors themselves have
not admitted that disclosure of
interoperable infor-
mation by Microsoft will have any negative impact on
their own incentives to innovate.80 Upon ‘accepting’ the
EC’s conclusion that the need to protect Microsoft’s
incentives to invest does not outweigh the exceptional
circumstances of the case, and on the basis that disclos-
ures made under the settlement in the USA did not
have a negative impact on the incentives, the CFI held
that Microsoft’s
incentive to innovate was unim-
paired.81 The CFI also asserted that Microsoft’s argu-
ments concerning the effects on its own incentives to
innovate were not relevant to the assessment as the
issue is the ‘impact of the refusal to supply on the
incentives for Microsoft’s competitors to innovate and
not on Microsoft’s incentives to innovate’.82 This goes
against the general principle that remedies must be
designed to provide both the dominant ﬁrms and its
competitors with incentives to compete aggressively for
the beneﬁt of consumers.83

It is submitted that there is not much that the domi-
nant undertaking can use as objective justiﬁcation once
‘indispensability’ of product is established.84 The CFI
ruling fails to acknowledge that a ﬁrm’s most valuable
assets are precisely the ones which tend to be disruptive
of competitors’ attempts to viably remain on the market.
In the interim judgment, the CFI had recognized the
presence of ‘valuable’ technologies and concluded that
the case was not unfounded prima facie since

account must be taken more generally of parameters such
as the value of the underlying investment, the value of the
information concerned for the organisation of the domi-
nant undertaking and the value transferred to competitors
in the event of disclosure.85

But in its ﬁnal judgment, the CFI refused to discuss the
differences in the value of IP right, stating only that

innovation or originality is ‘inherent’ in any IP right,
else no patent or copyright would be granted.86 Before
Microsoft, commentators took assurance that, in Magill
and IMS Health, the court could have been inﬂuenced
by the fact that the information was already available in
public domain.87 In fact, the EC had argued that the
‘programme listings [in Magill] are not in themselves
secret, innovative, or related to research’; similar argu-
ments were made in IMS Health which related to a
standardization case where the industry had contribu-
ted to the development of brick structure.88 It is sub-
mitted that making to distinguish IP rights involving
greater innovation or larger amount of
investment
from those that did not involve a great deal of innova-
tive effort or investment could have made a serious
impact on the ruling. Indeed, the CFI missed a valuable
opportunity to consolidate the previous precedents and
further develop clarity on the confrontation between IP
and competition laws.89

Need for interoperability and the
Software Directive
Interoperability in the broadest sense allows parts of
technology that
lie behind a product, process, or
service to form a coherent whole; it ensures that related
technologies can be interlinked such that a user can
operate a computer system comprising a mixture of
hardware and software products manufactured by
companies.90 Such interoperability infor-
different
mation is generally available in the public domain.
However, there are occasions when the developer of an
independently created program does not obtain sufﬁ-
cient information to allow his product to interoperate
and hence will lobby for the right to ‘decompile’ or
reverse engineer in order to obtain the information.91

information was available

In 1974, the EC received complaints from ﬁve compe-
titors of IBM that the latter was creating fear, uncer-
tainty, and doubt in the market by not making public
the operating principles of the interface between its soft-
ware and hardware and by causing delay in servicing
and updating the program run on non-IBM hardware.
92 When IBM introduced System 360CPU in 1964, its
interface
in the public
domain, well in advance, but upon gaining dominance
in the market IBM ceased supplying such information
necessary for competitors to develop products compati-
ble with IBM computer systems. In 1980, the EC issued
a Statement of Objections against IBM on the basis that
it had abused its dominant position in the market for
System/370 by not providing interoperability infor-
mation.93 The EC charged that the practice had the
effect of adversely affecting European computer manu-
facturers’ incentives to innovate and limiting consumer
choice in the market. Following intervention from US
antitrust authorities (which had dropped a similar com-
plaint against IBM despite investigations for 13 years on
the basis that evidence were ‘ﬂimsy’)94 and negotiations
with IBM ofﬁcials keen to demonstrate their signiﬁcant
economic position in the EU, the EC in 1984 accepted a
unilateral undertaking from IBM to provide timely
interoperability information to its competitors compar-
able to its own subsidiary operating in a downstream
market for a reasonable and non-discriminatory fee.95

Following the IBM settlement, the notion of inter-
operability was incorporated into the EU Directive on
Legal Protection of Computer Programs (Software
Directive).96 Article 6 of the Software Directive stipu-
lates that authorization of the copyright owner may
not be required for decompilation of
the program
which is
to obtain the information
necessary to achieve the interoperability of an indepen-
dently created computer program with other programs.

it emphasized that

Microsoft was required to provide interface infor-

the Software Directive.100
meaning of Article 6 of
interoperability was
Though Microsoft agreed that
necessary,
since it was not an
‘absolute standard’, it was the degree of interoperability
required for effective competition that was in dispute.101
The EC afﬁrmed that various software products in a
system interoperate, at least partially, when they are able
to exchange information and mutually to use the infor-
mation which has been exchanged.102

Both parties agreed that being on either end of the
spectrum of interoperability is not desirable. However,
difﬁculty arose as it is not possible to ﬁx a given level of
interoperability to be indispensable to the maintenance
of effective competition in the market.103 Based on the
Software Directive, Microsoft interpreted interoperability
to mean that the developer of a server operating system
can interoperate when all
the functionality of his
program can be accessed from Windows client OS.104
Microsoft contended that
the
various operating systems should be capable of exchan-
ging information or of reciprocally supplying services.105

it was sufﬁcient

that

It argued that interoperability is only necessary to the
extent that is functional such that the various operating
systems should be able to ‘work properly’ together and
information necessary for this is already available in the
market.106 It maintained that disclosure of additional
information would inevitably allow its competitors to
clone products which it had developed through its own
R&D.107 The EC rejected Microsoft’s deﬁnition of intero-
perability which,
it claimed, relied critically on the
concept of ‘access to functionality’ wherein access could
be interpreted as any kind of access, however limited or
cumbersome it may be.108 While emphasizing that the
information required did not include ‘source code’, it
stated that the information available provided a ‘lesser
degree of interoperability’ and did not allow competitors
to ‘work with’ Windows environment in a manner equiv-
alent to Microsoft’s own offering which in turn affected
competitors’ ability to remain viably on the market.109

Though the given level of interoperability required was
not established, the CFI found that non-Windows Work
Group Server OS could not continue to be marketed if
they were incapable of achieving a ‘high degree of inter-
operability with Windows’.110 This is because Windows
dominance had ‘extra-ordinary features’ afﬁrmed by its
market share representing it to be a ‘quasi-standard’ for
operating systems.111 Despite not being able to ﬁx a
given level of
indispensable or
making a clear distinction between high and full intero-
perability, the CFI found Microsoft’s assertions to be
simply a result of ‘misreading’ the contested decision.112

to develop,
produce, or market computer programs which were
substantially similar to its own programs, thus violating
Article 6(2)(c).113 In fact, it is doubtful that Article 6
of the Software Directive allows interoperable software
having the same functions as the program analysed and
designed to compete directly for the same market,
because that would unreasonably prejudice the right-
holder’s legitimate interest or conﬂict with the normal
exploitation of his program.114 Though the CFI
acknowledged that access to the interoperability infor-
mation would allow competitors to create products
which are identical (‘substantially similar’) to those of
Microsoft, it held that competitors would not have any
interest
simply
because they would ‘have no other choice’ but ‘differ-
entiate their product’ in order to have a competitive
advantage over Microsoft and maintain a proﬁtable
presence on the market.115 Interestingly, the CFI has
imposed no positive obligation on competitors receiv-
ing Microsoft’s information to innovate with the infor-
mation obtained via the ruling.

Microsoft because that equivalence gives competitors
an added advantage of circumventing much of the

principle that the pricing of IP rights ‘include a reward
element that could take it above price levels which
would apply in more normal competitive markets’.116

work could in fact be more important to the competi-
tors than the interoperability information itself as the
‘vertical remedy gives an advantage to . . . [competitors]
in horizontal competition’.118

Could the CFI’s ruling that Microsoft’s refusal had
an adverse impact on technical development be super-
imposed on the objectives of the Software Directive?
Though the Directive does not prevent the de-compiler
from re-utilizing elements not protected by copyright
law which he may have derived from the underlying
ideas and principles whether by reverse engineering or
otherwise119—such information may still be subject to
restrictions provided for by other forms of legal protec-
tion such as patents.120 Despite aiming for standard
interfaces and open systems, the Software Directive has
clearly taken into account the legitimate interests of IP
right-holder by prohibiting the re-use of information
for purposes other than interoperability.121 The Com-
mission’s Communication to the European Parliament
conveying their position on the proposal for the Direct-
ive supports this view:

Article 6 does not however permit decompilation beyond
what is necessary to achieve the interoperability of the
independently created program. It cannot therefore be used
to create a program reproducing parts of a decompiled
program having no relevance to the interoperability of the
independently created program.122

Further, Article 6(1) of the Directive does not entitle
independently created program owners
to obtain
interoperability information which is not relevant to a
functionality not already incorporated in that indepen-
dently created program. Decompilation can be necess-
ary for interoperability at the developmental stage of
program-creation as long as the de-compiler can justify
his actions in accordance with Article 6.123 Though the
Directive does not explicitly state that the indepen-
dently created program should have already been
created before decompilation,
it is unlikely that the
Directive allows the de-compiler to start developing
an independent program after he has decompiled.

it will be difﬁcult for a de-compiler to
Otherwise,
explain why decompilation was indispensable for inter-
operability or that the necessary information was not
readily made available by right holder by other means
as required by Article 6(1) because he will not have
deﬁned the interoperability which his program will
seek to achieve with those of the right holder’s pro-
grams.124 Czarnota and Hart write:

For the would-be decompiler, it is very important to recog-
nise that although it is not necessary to have produced a
fully coded independently created program before embark-
ing upon decompilation . . . it will be necessary to be able to
demonstrate a ‘paper trail’ showing the existence of the
program before decompilation was embarked upon.125

Though it would be right to allow intermediate copying
for the purpose of interoperability, the Software Direc-
tive does not permit programmers to copy in order to
create infringing programs. In addition, it is necessary
to consider the ‘difﬁculties of demonstrating infringe-
ment in re-written ﬁnal products’.126 For instance, Leith
argues that infringers who use protected inventions will
be able to hide the infringing use, especially when the
invention is not related to outward appearance or
‘surface’ functionality of the program.127 He reiterates
that the litigant who suspects infringement may have to
carry out copyright infringement in order to determine
whether his rivals have committed infringement.128

was to obviate any need for reverse engineering given
that it is a costly and time-consuming practice, by pro-
viding an incentive to manufacturers to make available
adequate information to ensure interoperability in
exchange for royalties.131 The purpose of Article 6,
therefore is ‘to act as a safety valve in the event that

or

otherwise poorly

The ‘perfect’ remedy
Competition in the market can be severely distorted if the
ensuing remedy is ‘too lenient, too severe, too late, not
administrable
conceived or
implemented’.133 If the remedy imposed on Microsoft is
ﬂawed, there is a danger that dominant ﬁrms in the
market would engage in conduct which would stiﬂe inno-
vation. Remedies and sanctions imposed on ‘abusive’
dominant ﬁrms have not yet received sufﬁcient academic
attention.134 The EC is permitted to bring infringement
of Article 81/82 to an end by imposing behavioural or
structural remedies proportionate to the infringement
committed and necessary to bring the infringement effec-
tively to an end.135 Compliance of remedies and obli-
gations are enforced by means of appropriate levels of
ﬁnes and periodic penalty payments ‘having regard to the
gravity or duration’ of negligent or intentional infringe-
ment of competition law by erring undertaking.136 Sanc-
tions in the form of ﬁnes, damages, or even disgorgement
of proﬁts have the advantage of being easily administrable
with the need of hardly any supervision at all, though the
monetary sanctions in themselves do not restore compe-
tition in the market.137 As in the case of other remedies,
if the ﬁnes are not high enough they fail to deter future
infringement, whereas if there are too high, they will
deter dominant ﬁrms from investing in Europe. Micro-
soft faced monetary sanctions totalling an unprecedented
Euro 1.68 billion for abuse of dominance and non-com-
pliance with the contested decision.138 Meanwhile Micro-
soft had arrived at ﬁnancial
settlements with its
opponents at ﬁgures far higher than the ﬁnes imposed on
it by the EC.139 Given that settlements are an important

initiated the EC proceeding against Microsoft) were not
accorded appropriate value.

Also important is the question of the ‘indeﬁnite’
nature of the EC remedy for Microsoft. Unfortunately,
no time-scale regarding the application of remedies was
decided in Microsoft. Microsoft was obliged to disclose
to competitors not only its current proprietary speciﬁ-
cations but also the output of its future R&D.140 In
the US for several decades, conduct remedies under
section 2 of the Sherman Act have been of strictly
deﬁned duration, generally lasting for 5 to 10 years.
Remedies which last
for 10 years normally have
provisions for modiﬁcation in response to changed cir-
cumstances. According to Justice Posner,
‘injunctions
of indeﬁnite length cast the enforcement agency . . . and
the court in the role of a regulatory agency’.141

Microsoft highlights the debate on whether it is appro-
priate for competition authorities and the courts to take
the role of regulator of high-tech industry. As the US
courts stated in Trinko, imposing a duty to aid competi-
tors often ‘requires antitrust courts to act as central plan-
ners, identifying the proper price, quantity and other
terms of dealing—a role for which they are ill-suited’.142
Should competition authorities in the EU encourage
competition in the market by setting terms and con-
ditions of business transactions and second-guessing
innovations even when they are not sure of the impact of
such a decision on the consumer’s welfare and inno-
vation?143 The EC has been criticized for its increasingly
notorious role as both prosecutor and judge, while it has
been asked whether the CFI is engaging in judicial acti-
vism.144 The independent EAGCP Report commissioned
by DG COMP called for a ‘non-dirigiste’ approach to
competition policy by not falling into ‘the trap of active
intervention and ﬁne-tuning; [and] whenever possible,
competition is to be preferred to detailed regulation as
the best mechanism to avoid inefﬁciencies and foster
productivity and growth’.145 The EAGCP Report cau-
tioned the application of competition policy as a tool for

active policy intervention designed to correct the inefﬁ-
ciencies associated with monopolies and oligopolies so as
to maximize some measure of ‘consumer welfare’.146 In
this respect, the risk of adverse effects on innovation due
to excessive intervention is much higher than the risk
due to limited intervention.147

Recognizing that behavioural remedies are susceptible
to strategic neutralization, minimization, or evasion and
that it did not necessarily change incentives to engage in
‘abusive’ behaviour, the EC ordered a monitoring mech-
anism against Microsoft.148 Accordingly, a monitoring
trustee who was pro-actively to ensure compliance was
given independent access
to Microsoft’s assistance,
information, documents, premises, and employees and
to the source code of the relevant Microsoft products at
the expense of Microsoft. Without putting in place an
alternative mechanism,
struck down this
remedy by stating that the EC had gone beyond its auth-
ority to ensure compliance. This is strange as the IT
industry has a constantly changing technical landscape,
making it possible for Microsoft to place barriers to the
required information by means of delay, use of cumber-
some documentation, etc. so that, despite an outward
projection of compliance, the mechanism is ineffective.

the CFI

The decision in retrospect
In December 2007, Microsoft decided not to appeal
against the CFI ruling and complied with the contested
decision.149 The Chief Judge of the CFI in the Microsoft
case, Bo Vesterdorf, indicated that from an academic
point of view, it may be regretted that Microsoft failed
to appeal and seek a decisive ruling from the ECJ.150
Following the ruling, he took into account suggestions
that it could have a negative effect on the incentives to
invest in Europe.151 The market consequence of the
decision on Microsoft
is debatable given Microsoft’s
‘express willingness’ to license much of the protocol tech-
nology at stake on reasonable and non-discriminatory

terms and also due to the fact that there is no mechan-
ism to monitor whether this is so.152

is applied to regular cases of refusal

What is more worrying is that abuse of dominant
position can now be found more easily, affecting inno-
vation and ‘consumer welfare’ if the reasoning in the
judgment
to
license IP rights by dominant ﬁrms. One may argue
that Microsoft allows competitors to demand access as
long as the product places them at a ‘competitive econ-
omic disadvantage’. This has effectively widened the
scope of Article 82 to the point that a dominant ﬁrm’s
refusal to license IP rights will be held abusive even if it
results only in preventing competitors from producing
identical or similar products. Compulsorily licensing IP
rights in these cases would affect the value of IP if
innovators only have economic interests in their rights
by means of ‘reasonable’ royalties which usually is a
nominal amount.153 Firms may conceal their lines of
development if they see little use in protection ‘which
advertise their wares’ but takes away their control.154

Such consequences could have been limited if the CFI
had sufﬁciently emphasized that the circumstances relat-
ing to Microsoft were ‘exceptional’. Nowhere in the
Microsoft judgment does the CFI afﬁrm that the con-
ditions for a duty to deal will only ever be met in the
rarest of circumstances.155 By distinguishing Microsoft
from previous cases and by isolating and specifying the
circumstances, it would have reassured IP advocates that
abuse of Article 82 will be found in refusal to supply IP
rights cases only under exceptional circumstances. In
contrast, competition authorities should guard against
the danger of equating complex cases with cases of
‘exceptional circumstances’ necessitating the derogation
of IP rights by using competition rules. However, the
current case only gives the appearance that the EC is
stealthily expanding the scope of Article 82 to ensure
that competition policy retains priority in Europe at the
expense of the rights granted by IP law. Though the EC
and CFI’s objective of protecting consumers in Microsoft
can be appreciated, the manner in which it was justiﬁed
and achieved can result in uncertainty which affects the

the effectiveness of competition policy enforcement’.156
While it is not in the best interests to pursue rigidity in
the application of Article 82, it should not be so malle-
able either, such that certainty is affected in the legal
environment in which businesses can operate.

Commentators have argued that private property
must always give way to public good.157 However,
juxta-positioning private property and public good in
the context of IP law and consumer welfare is not easy:
IP rights are deﬁned and have a process prior to exclu-
sive rights being granted, whereas what constitutes
public good can vary enormously.158 As the EAGCP
Report conceded:

The use of the single term ‘consumer welfare’ conceals the
fact
that we are really talking about a multi-faceted
concern . . . with consumer welfare effects going in different
directions in the different markets.159

It would be appropriate to identify and deﬁne the
public good that one seeks to achieve before appro-
priating private property.

At this point, it is necessary to appreciate that IP law
curtails abuse of IP rights which results in competition
being affected in the market.160 IP rights are also
restrained by their duration and scope, reﬂecting the
trade-off between the exclusion of competition and
promotion of innovation. Despite several EU Directives
on IP, disparities with regard to the means of enforce-
ment of IP rights in the various Member States have
only served to weaken substantive IP law in Europe.
The non-harmonization of the IP laws in all areas
across the EU has led to those rights being faced with
opposition from DG Comp rather than playing a
complementary supportive role to competition policy
with a view to promoting innovation.

It is debatable if the deﬁciencies of the IP system can
(or should) be remedied by using competition rules.161

Sujitha Subramanian . The Microsoft Decision

ARTICLE

259

The scope of IP rights as deﬁned by respective national
laws of each Member States must not be altered by
extending the scope of Article 82, but should be dealt
with by means of
speciﬁc Community legislation.
Unfortunately, there is no institution to protect IP
rights that is equivalent to the DG Comp in the EU. The
presence of such an IP institution equivalent to DG
Comp would not mean that Microsoft would have never
occurred, but the reason for demanding interoperable
information from Microsoft would have been different.

It is debatable if the deficiencies of the IP system
can (or should) be remedied by using competition

rules

Accepting a hierarchy in which one area of law can trump
another will affect the balance that is most likely to create
an optimal environment for innovation. In this regard,
Astra-Zeneca is interesting, given that the EC found the
ﬁrm guilty of infringing Article 82 by misusing the patent
system to block or delay market entry for generic compe-
tition.162 The case was followed by a report on the
pharmaceutical sector which indicated how competition
policy could be involved in protecting the consumers
against misuse of patent rights.163 Attempting to reach
standard solutions for various situations of IP/compe-
tition policy conﬂict will not help in the long-run as it
will inhibit both areas of law from developing to achieve
the desired objective of innovation.

The recent Commission Guidance on the Application
of Article 82 aims to use an effects-based economic
approach while analysing abuse of dominant position
cases. Unfortunately, Microsoft has made it clear that the

courts can only be expected to make a limited review of
complex technical and economic assessment made by
the EC in abuse of dominance cases.164 Further, the
Guidelines appears to be a justiﬁcation for a decision
already taken by the EC.165 This could be dangerous as
there is a possibility in future, of overlooking the speciﬁc
circumstances of the case based on which the decision
was taken. It is necessary to assure industry that IP
rights are protected sufﬁciently by ensuring that DG
Competition works in conjunction with DG Internal
Market and relevant IP authorities.166

The Treaty of Lisbon speciﬁcally indicates the inten-
tion to establish measures for the creation of European
IP rights, to provide uniform protection of IP rights
throughout the Union and to set up of centralized
Union-wide authorization, coordination, and supervi-
sion arrangements.167 There is clearly a need for
Community patent and the
establishment of an
efﬁcient EU-wide patent jurisdiction.168 The Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property
Rights should be given due regard to prevent creation
of scepticism that IP rights have far less value in the
EU.169 EU competition advocates seem to have reached
a phase where IP right is considered an inconvenience
and achieving a competitive market appear to be the
end goal rather than the means (as much as IP rights
are the means) to creating an environment which is
optimal
for productivity and innovation. Though
abuse of IP rights must be curbed, the course adopted
by competition authorities seems to smack of deter-
minedly chipping away IP rights which have tradition-
ally been used for promotion of innovation. Though it
is necessary to check abusive conduct of
super-
dominant ﬁrms in the market, it is worth noting that
bulldozing a forest to capture the rare predator can
lead to other creatures being trampled on the way.
