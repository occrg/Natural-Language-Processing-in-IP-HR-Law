To keep INN or out
Sachin Bindal and Amit Koli*

Ever since India opened up its patent regime in January
2005 to include product patents in the ﬁeld of pharma-
ceuticals, the patent law in this domain has kept alive the
interest of various stakeholders. This is rightly so, since
India is also known as the pharmacy of the world and is
a global market leader in the export of generic drugs to
the United States and Japan, as well as to countries in
Africa and Europe. The Indian generic pharmaceutical in-
dustry had a turnover of US$11 billion in 2010, registering a
growth rate of 22 per cent.1 During 2013– 2014, pharma-
ceutical exports stood at Rs 90 000 crores (US$14.55
billion).2 Also, India is one of the largest consumers of
medicines in the world, even though accessibility of medi-
cines across economically weaker sections remains an issue.
The Indian patent regime is well equipped to balance the
quid-pro-quo requirement of patents. Even though jur-
isprudence in this ﬁeld is still evolving, recent judicial
precedents have reafﬁrmed that this is so.

In 2013, the Indian Patent Ofﬁce (IPO) proposed a re-
quirement of disclosure of International Nonproprietary
Names (INNs) in patent applications relating to pharma-
inventions.3 Thereafter, the IPO organized a
ceutical
meeting with different stakeholders to discuss the pro-
posal and receive feedback on the feasibility and imple-
mentation of this policy. The proposal was to make the
disclosure of INNs mandatory and for the Patent Rules to
be amended to provide the necessary basis for this. The
stakeholders put voiced their concerns both for and
against the proposal. The IPO ﬁnally decided to reject the
proposal at least of making this a mandatory requirement,
so the Patent Rules remain unchanged. It goes to IPO’s
credit that the proposal of mandatory disclosure of INNs
in the patent speciﬁcation was removed from the recently
issued guidelines for examination of pharmaceutical appli-
cations. However, the guidelines instruct the examiner to
search prior art based on any INN disclosed in the speciﬁca-
tion. Further, in the case of second medical use4 inventions,

the examiner is directed to ask the applicant to disclose the
INN of the known substance where second medical use
is claimed. In the event that the applicant does not give
such information even upon request, the examiner is
required to seek to ascertain the INN and to search prior
art based on it.

In this article, we attempt to explore the use of INNs
as a proposed tool for searching prior art and examine
whether INNs would indeed make things simpler for
patent examiners in India. Some of the issues were dis-
cussed during various stakeholder meetings held at the
IPO, before this proposal was ﬁnally dropped.

General background of INNs
The INN or generic name is an ofﬁcial name given to a
pharmaceutical substance, as designated by the World
Health Organization (WHO). An INN identiﬁes a
pharmaceutical substance or active pharmaceutical ingre-
dient by a unique name that is globally recognized and

Apart from INN nomenclature, there are also various
systems of nomenclature across different countries, such
as British Approved Names (BANs) and United States
Adopted Names (USANs) to identify pharmaceutical
substance with an ofﬁcial nonproprietary name.5

Table 1 provides examples of INNs.

The questions
The proposal for using INN as a search tool raised a
number of questions, including the following: What makes
INNs suddenly a sought-after tool for searching prior art
patents? Would it be beneﬁcial for the patent examiner to
have a disclosure regarding INNs? Might it not be an extra
burden on applicants seeking patents in India? Is there any
vested interest of any group or agency in fueling the sudden
need for such disclosure in Indian applications? Would this
requirement be TRIPs-compliant?

INNs as a tool for searching earlier
patents
The proposal to disclose INNs was based on the premise
that this would help the examiner to conduct a search of
prior patents more effectively.

To examine this hypothesis, we designed a sample
prior patent search5 related to the method of synthesis
for aspirin. The results are shown in Table 2.

We found that search string B, which used the IUPAC
name of aspirin, found two relevant results out of four
documents in the domain of method of synthesis of
aspirin. In fact, string A appeared to have missed two
most relevant results which were found by string B (as
there are no common patents between string A and B as
shown above). Thus INNs did not prove to provide an
effective search tool in this instance.

Further, to conﬁrm this provisional conclusion, we
designed another study for prior patent search6 in the

domain of composition of rotigotine. Rotigotine is a drug
that was approved in Europe for the treatment of Parkin-
son’s disease and restless legs syndrome in 2006. For this
trial, we changed the subject matter of the search (from
‘method of synthesis’ to ‘composition’), the name of drug
molecule (from ‘aspirin’ to ‘rotigotine’) and the search
ﬁeld (from ‘title’ to ‘title, abstract or claims’ to broaden
the patent search), as there may be a presumption that
aspirin is a too old a drug, and String A would neverthe-
less miss patents in the domain of method of synthesis
(where generally the IUPAC name is disclosed in synthesis
patents). However, we reached the same conclusion as
mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 3.

Out of four documents captured by String F, three
documents belong to same patent family which discloses
composition comprising acid addition salts of rotigo-
tine, while one remaining document talks about novel
rotigotine salts. In other words, these patents or applica-
tions were not relevant to our search, as they related to

salts of rotigotine and its composition but not to the
composition of rotigotine as such.

Further, string D missed a few results that are highly
relevant to the ﬁeld of study, already captured in
String E. We found that search string E, which used
the IUPAC name of rotigotine, found four relevant
results (US7413747B2, US20080138389A1, US6884434B1
and US20050033065A1) among 26 documents in the
domain of composition of rotigotine as such. In fact, among
four relevant documents, there are patents US7413747B2
and US6884434B1 listed in the Orange Book. Orange
Book-listed patents are highly relevant patents that are
published by the Food and Drug Administration (the US
drug approval agency). Thus INNs appeared to fail as an
efﬁcient search tool to obtain the relevant prior art.

In addition, we designed one more study in the domain
of the polymorph (crystalline) form of axitinib and found
the same conclusion as mentioned above. The results are
shown in Table 4.

Two documents captured by String I were not relevant
to our domain of search. Further, string G missed a few
results which are highly relevant to the ﬁeld of study,
already captured in String H. In other words, we found
that search string H, which used the IUPAC name of axiti-
nib, captured one Orange Book-listed patents US8791140B2
disclosing the crystalline form of axitinib and its corre-
sponding EP and WO patent applications which was
missed by String G.7

The currently available searching tools, such as molecular
formulae, structural diagrams, clinical trial codes and
systematic names under the IUPAC nomenclature, Chem-
ical Abstracts Services (CAS) registry numbers etc, have
been well tried and tested. These well-established tools
have been recognized worldwide to be effective in search-

ing prior art data, and no major patent ofﬁce requires
disclosure of INNs in the patent application.

Sometimes, there may even be a conﬂict between
substances still being referred to with national names such
as BANs, De´nominations communes franc¸aises (DCFs),
Japanese Adopted Names (JANs) and USANs, which
are similar in purpose to the INN. There may be cases
where there will be a difference between INNs and other
approved national names such as BANs, JANs or USANs.
For example, Flurothyl is an approved USAN, whereas its
INN is Flurotyl.8 This could lead to confusion. It is thus
concluded that the requirement of disclosing INNs may
create confusion in patent prosecution.

Why link patents to INNs?
Was it a good idea to link patents to INN? If it was, who
should take on the burden of linking patents to INNs?
Would the applicant have found it unnecessarily cumber-
some to disclose the INN before ﬁling the patent applica-
tion? At best, any link between the patent and the INN
should be the responsibility of regulatory bodies during
the drug approval stage.

Including INNs at the time of ﬁling the
patent application
Drug patents are ﬁled as soon as the pharmaceutical re-
search and development (R&D) shows promise in an in-
vention. Accordingly, compounds of interest are unlikely
to have an INN at the patenting stage. Some patents actual-
ly use laboratory acronyms for naming these compounds.
It is therefore a practical challenge to include the INN at
the time of ﬁling of a patent application, which is why
patent applications almost never use INNs. Besides, since
the international patent system does not allow for adding
subject matter once the application has been ﬁled, the in-
clusion of an INN does not present a viable approach.

Internationally, linking patents to INNs is done at the
regulatory stage when applying for drug approval and
not at the patenting stage itself. Patent linkage at the
product approval stage is meant to prevent patent in-
fringement by generics and is followed by several coun-
tries that are members of the World Trade Organization.
Further, such linkage requires a closer collaboration of
health regulators and the patent ofﬁce.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used
to link approved drug products (which had an INN) to
patents on their website using a repository known as the

Patent information corresponding to a drug product
is submitted by the sponsor/applicant to the FDA, de-
pending on the approval status of the product applica-
tion. Following the product’s approval, the FDA publishes
the list of patents mapped with that product (which has
an INN) in the Orange Book.

A few years back, a decree was published in the ofﬁcial
Gazette of the Federal Government of Mexico, which
amended the Regulations of the Health Law as well as
the Regulations of the Law on Industrial Property. This
new amendment imposed upon the Mexican Institute of
Industrial Property (IMPI) an obligation to publish a
special gazette listing those patents relating to allopathic
drugs and their corresponding INNs. This new regime was
brought in to beneﬁt patent owners, as following this
amendment, the Mexican health authorities would not
grant health registrations for products covering the active
ingredients as published in the gazette, until the expiry
of the patent.10 In this case, applicants for marketing
approval of pharmaceutical products are required to
inform the health regulatory authorities whether or not
they are the patent holder or licensee for any existing
patent relevant to that product. An the applicant who
does not have a patent or licence must provide a declar-
ation that the product application does not infringe the
rights of the patent holder.

The health authorities work with the IMPI to deter-
mine the patent status of the product for which there is
a pending marketing application. If the search indicates
that a valid patent would be infringed, the health au-
thorities will give the applicant an opportunity to dem-
onstrate that it has the rights to the product. In the
alternative, the health authorities will reject the product
application.11

Similarly, in China, the State Food and Drug Admin-
istration (SFDA) maintains two separate tracks by which
it provides patent linkage for compound/composition
patents:
† The SFDA requires all applicants for marketing approval
to check patent status prior to making an application,
and to certify that their products do not infringe any
existing patents; they must also acknowledge liability
for damage resulting from any future ﬁnding of patent
infringement.
† The SFDA maintains a list of all drug product regis-
trations by chemical names (INNs), which is available
for frequent inspection by patent owners, who can
check whether there are applications for marketing ap-
proval for new products that may infringe any existing
patents.12

In the interest of the patent owners and in order to avoid
copying of a patented drug, such linkage between patent
and INNs at the regulatory stage does appear justiﬁed.
The aim of the INN system has been to provide health
professionals with a unique, universally available, desig-
nated name to identify each pharmaceutical substance.
The existence of an international nomenclature for
pharmaceutical substances, in the form of INNs, is for
identiﬁcation, safe prescription and dispensing of medi-
cines to patients, and also for communication and ex-
change of information among health professionals. The
role of INNs is mainly for regulatory and commercial
purposes and not for patenting issues. Readers may also
recall that, in Bayer v Cipla,13 the Indian High Court
and the Indian Supreme Court clearly ruled that there
can be no overlap between regulatory and patent law.
This would also apply in the present context where the
regulatory and commercial role of INNs should not

overlap with the patent by disclosing an INN in a
patent application.

What would it take to disclose an INN
in a patent application?
INNs are allocated by the WHO on the advice of experts
from the WHO Expert Advisory Panel on the International
Pharmacopoeia and Pharmaceutical Preparations. The
process of INN selection follows three main steps:

1. a request/application is made by the applicant company;

2. after a review of the request, a proposed INN is

selected and published for comments;

3. after a time-period for comments and objections has
lapsed, the name will obtain the status of a recom-
mended INN and will be published.

Importantly, the rules relating to the application for
an INN speciﬁcally state that an INN for a substance
should only be applied for once it has been tested on
human subjects.

Concerns of the patent applicant
Patent applicants seeking a drug patent in India have had
substantial concerns with regard to the inclusion of INNs
in the patents’ description. These concerns include the
risk of losing novelty due to delay in obtaining an INN
from the WHO; the lack of clarity as to the consequences
of not including an INN in the description (even though

the recent examination guidelines on pharmaceutical
inventions issued by the IPO do not mandate the disclos-
ure of INN now); possible loss of patent term, where the
IPO decides to withhold the grant of a patent for want of
INN disclosure; misuse by third parties due to frivolous
oppositions or invalidation proceedings, particularly on
the ground of s 3(d) of Indian Patents Act; and practical
difﬁculties in specifying INNs for all possible components
of a claimed composition or a Markush representation.14

Section 10(4) of the Indian Patents Act clearly deﬁnes
what the speciﬁcation of the patent application shall con-
tain. The ‘best method of performing the invention’ re-
quirement under s 10(4) (b) of the same Act clearly
states that the applicant/inventor is entitled to protec-
tion by disclosing the best method of performing the
invention. The disclosure of an INN does not appear to
be a reliable source of describing an invention; nor does
it provide any aid in enabling a person skilled in the art
to carry out or apply the invention. It is only wise that
this requirement should be dropped:

burden on the applicant, who in any event must over-
come other important legal barriers before obtaining a
drug patent in India.

Legally speaking, under Article 27 of the Agreement
on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS), members of the said agreement cannot discrim-
inate between different ﬁelds of technology in their patent
regimes. By rejecting the proposal for mandatory require-
ment of disclosing an INN in the speciﬁcation, India has
saved itself from being potentially accused of discrimin-

ation between other technologies and pharmaceuticals,
which would be contrary to TRIPS.

From sudden interest to careful thought
The sudden interest of the Indian Patent Ofﬁce in require
disclosure of INN in a patent application came as a sur-
prise to patent applicants in the pharma domain. Given
that debate over the patenting of pharmaceutical inven-
tions in India is no longer restricted to legal issues but
evokes serious emotive issues, the IPO was certainly faced
with dilemma of having to address both. Admirably, the
IPO took a reasonable and balanced view on this issue

pursuant to elaborate discussions on this issue with
various stakeholders. It may augur well for the patent
fraternity if the IPO thoroughly researches the need and
usefulness of such proposals, which have a great impact
on all the stakeholders before initiating any nationwide
debate.

The patent search outlined in Table 6 was performed
in Total Patent Database on 15 April 2015. The Search
ﬁeld remains the same as Title, Abstract or claims in US,
EP and WO. The same conclusion was drawn as men-
tioned above, ie that the strings based on INN missed the
relevant results which were captured by the strings based
on the IUPAC name.
