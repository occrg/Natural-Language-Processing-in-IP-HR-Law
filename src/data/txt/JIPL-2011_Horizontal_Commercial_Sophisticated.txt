Horizontal patents, commercial benefit, and
sophisticated patent strategies
Oliver Baldus* and Chris Heckmann

This article evaluates the economic aspects of patents
on the basis of value chain production. Speciﬁcally, it
aims to classify, and perform a qualitative differen-
tiation of,
the types of patents in the context of
modern supply chains by analysing their respective
strengths and weaknesses with regard to economic
questions. Its objective is to give the reader a better
insight into the types of problems facing market actors,
the role of patents in these situations, as well as viable
governance strategies for overcoming those problems.

Legally speaking, each type of patent affords the
owner the same level of protection with regard to the
right to prohibit unauthorized use of his invention;
they differ greatly, however,
in regard to the actual
enforceability of these rights. On account of these dis-
crepancies, the monetary value should reﬂect the actual
value of the patent, which is dependent primarily on
who the patent-owner is.

With respect to value chains, patents can be classi-
ﬁed mainly into vertical, horizontal, and external
patents. While vertical patents can act merely as passive
defence mechanisms against competitors, horizontal
patents have the potential
to inﬂuence contractual
relationships directly. Only external patents, however,
can be used to really prevent unwanted usage of the
protected invention. The deliberate modiﬁcation of
these characteristics allows for the creation of new,
sophisticated patent strategies (SPS).

Supply chains
Modern economies are based on division of labour, ie a
ﬁnal product is manufactured and assembled sequen-
tially, by a number of
independent entities. The
sequence of companies or ﬁrms through which the
product is passed is termed the supply chain. These
typically begin with ﬁrms processing raw materials, and
end with the completion of a market-ready product.
Real supply chains can involve an enormous amount of

Figure 1. Supply chains in combination with various types of patents.

Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed supply chain for cars.
Rectangles represent different companies, and the deliv-
ery of goods from one company to the next is indicated
by arrows. Accordingly, production starts on the left
and ends on the right side. On each horizontal step of
the supply chain, value is added to the product. To
illustrate, in Figure 1 a steel producer mines ore and
delivers steel to a gear manufacturer. The gear manu-
facturer then processes the steel and delivers gears to a
gearbox manufacturer, who in turn supplies a car
producer.

Competitors to companies on a particular value-
added step are arranged vertically and are differentiated
in accordance with the business segment they cover.
The lower steel producer, for instance, might have a
competitor whose business segment overlaps with his
own and also extends partially into a different level of
the supply chain. An example of this might be another
steel producer who not only produces steel for gears,
but also prepares alloy for other purposes; thus the
rectangle representing the lower steel producer has a
different size and position to the one representing the
upper steel/alloy producer. In accordance with this
scheme,
the upper gear producer may also deliver
primary components for gearboxes, while the upper car
producer might assemble his own gearboxes.

In addition, the lower part of Figure 1 shows two
further companies operating in economic areas that
have no relationship to these car supply chains: a TV
producer and a ﬁrm that owns patent rights but does
not actually produce any products directly, sometimes
called a patent troll.

In this way, Figure 1 allows for a simple representa-
tion of all ﬁrms and business activities in the supply

chain, making both the relative position of each entity
as well as their degree of involvement easily discernible.

Patents in supply chains
The supply chain representation in Figure 1 can be
further expanded by including the patents involved:
patent owners are represented as dots; the particular
technological areas the patents cover, as well as their
scope of protection, are represented as ellipses of
varying sizes, extending either horizontally or vertically.

Zero value (ZV) and low value (LV)
patents
Zero value (ZV) patents pertain to technologies that
remain completely within the patent-owning company;
inventions protected by these kinds of patents are used
only by their corresponding owners, and other compa-
nies are not dependent on, or interested in, the tech-
nology. These types of patents are not economical due
to their inability to regain the costs that were spent on
having the patent granted and maintained.

It is sometimes argued, however, that, in order to
prevent other ﬁrms from getting a patent on one’s own
technology, it is necessary to obtain ZV or LV patents,
thereby avoiding the risk of third party prohibition
rights on technologies important to the company. This
argument carries little weight, however, since prevent-
ing other ﬁrms from getting a patent on self-used tech-

nology can be achieved easily, and at virtually no cost,
simply by disclosing the invention.

In the case of our steel producer, ZV patents could,
for example, relate to a special method of mining, use
of which can be made only at the particular geograph-
ical location of the steel producer. This scenario is re-
presented in Figure 1 by patent ZV, the scope of which
is conﬁned to the company’s technical area.

Similar examples of

the ZV-patent class can be
found in companies that have no competitor, ie mono-
polists, or producers of highly specialized products that
have only one customer, who is bound by long-term
contracts, ie monopsonists. In the latter case, patent
protection is not required since potential competitors
are not able to supply goods to the sole demander.
Patent protection would merely prevent competitors
from producing goods which they would not be able to
sell anyway. For example, a producer of tank muzzles
cannot gain anything by seeking a patent for his tech-
nologies if he has a long-term contract with the only
existing tank manufacturer.

In reality, ZV patents are exceptions and tend to
merge with the much larger group of low value (LV)
patents.

LV patents are IP rights whose scope of protection
cannot fully reach the competitor for some reason.
This weak legal position is shown in Figure 1 by
patents LV1 and LV2, whose scope extends beyond the
companies’ border but affects competitors in neither
vertical nor horizontal direction.

An example of such a scenario would be the lower
steel producer owning a patent granting legal protec-
tion only within his own country and the upper steel/
alloy producer being located abroad (LV1). In another
situation, the lower steel producer could own a patent
on a technology for producing gears that is presently
not economically viable, ie cost-efﬁcient (LV2).

The most common example of patents belonging to
the LV class is those granting national protection to a
company that has a competitor abroad and to which
this legal protection does not extend. Other patents of
this class relate to technical problems for which a differ-
ent solution to the one legally protected is available or
can be easily found, eg non-infringing workaround sol-
utions. Patents with an extremely small scope of protec-
tion could also fall into the LV class, as well as patents
for which detecting an infringement is not easily poss-
ible, as is the case with many production methods.

In summary, all patents that cannot be efﬁciently
enforced, be it for technical, legal, economical, or geo-

graphical reasons, can be considered LV patents. To be
sure,
the number of LV patents well exceeds the
number of ZV patents.

Vertical (V) patents
Vertical (V) patents relate to and affect supply chains
in a vertical direction. They thus occupy the area
between direct competitors, who are located at the
same horizontal position within their respective supply
chains.

V patents belong to the ﬁrst group of patents that
can be considered fully ﬂedged. This means that, in
principle, they give their owners an actual, enforceable
right in regard to direct competitors. In practice, verti-
cal patents constitute the largest group since they orig-
inate
activities
conducted on own business and technology areas; this
directly affects competitors using similar technology.

from research and development

Exclusion rights granted by this type of patent often
cannot be exercised, however, since the competitor
usually owns V-type ‘counter patents’ and a mutual
interdependency between the ﬁrms arises, leading to a
legal stand-off position. Enforcing a particular IP right
in this situation would automatically lead to retaliation
by the competitor, resulting in legal conﬂicts that
unnecessarily waste company resources. Since these
legal conﬂicts often cannot be won by either party,
coexistence and collaboration usually occur.2

To illustrate, the lower gear producer in Figure 1
might own a patent for a particular method of produ-
cing gears (V1) that is also used by the upper ﬁrm,
while the upper ﬁrm might own a patent on punching
holes into gears (V2). In practice, these types of stand-
off situations are typically resolved by simply tolerating
the other companies, as expressed formally by cross-
licensing agreements.

V patents therefore serve merely as possible defence
mechanisms against hostile attacks, be they based on IP
rights or on economic factors, such as aggressive mar-
keting. In this sense, V patents constitute defence and
deterrence positions since, for example, they discourage
injunctions between competitors due to
provisional
mutually assured destruction. In general,
it can be
stated that V patents establish informal rules of coexis-
tence between independent companies since formal
rules—in the form of contracts—often do not exist
and might even be prohibited by competition law.

Although V patents could theoretically be used to
exert prohibition rights, this possibility is often ignored

Horizontal (H) patents
As the name suggests, H patents take effect along the
horizontal direction of a supply chain, as shown in
Figure 1 by patents H1 and H2. In such a case, a ﬁrm
owns a patent on technology used by a direct supplier
or patron of that ﬁrm. In order to completely under-
stand the effects of these types of patents, it is necessary
to digress brieﬂy into the ﬁeld of New Institutional
Economics (NIE).

Most often, the relationship between a supplier and
his client is deﬁned by contracts, eg in form of supply
agreements. Theoretically,
these contracts are ‘com-
plete’, that is, they account for every single contingency
that might arise over the course of the contractual
relationship, and specify what is to be done in each
case,
leaving no room for interpretation. This is an
is to be constructed. In

they all

nerable to exploitation by the other.3

there are no ‘complete’ contracts;
‘gaps’, undeﬁned areas

In order

to see how patents can address

this
problem, we must ﬁrst examine the speciﬁc nature of
these situations.

Incomplete contracts and hold-up problems
incomplete contracts give rise to what
In NIE,
termed the hold-up problem.

is

A hold-up situation arises when one of the two ﬁrms
has made a speciﬁc investment relating to a contract.
For example, a ﬁrm could have bought a certain kind of
machine used speciﬁcally for producing the vendor
parts of its contract partner. By making this investment,
the ﬁrm has dedicated itself to the contract, and thereby
put itself at risk of exploitation since it is no longer able
to change its business partner without losing a signiﬁ-
cant portion of its investment. This assumes that the
machines cannot simply be sold to a different client,
hence the term ‘speciﬁcity’. Making use of contractual
gaps, a gain-maximizing business partner can exploit

this situation by demanding a renegotiation of the con-
tract terms in order to obtain, for example, a price
decrease.4 A prudent ﬁrm will, however, anticipate such
a hold-up attempt and consequently avoid contracts
requiring speciﬁc investments of this nature. Thus, even
though theoretically the most efﬁcient and gain-maxi-
mizing solution would be to cooperate, no transaction
takes place, on account of one or both parties’ concerns
of being exploited by the other.

This is only the case as long as having a speciﬁc
investment exploited makes the investing company
worse off than it would be by not investing at all—
which is not always the case; in many situations, a ﬁrm
will choose to invest, even though it knows fully well
that the potential for a hold-up by its contract partner
is high.

To give a realistic example of a hold-up situation,
imagine a situation in which the car manufacturer
from our supply chain in Figure 1—let’s call him Auto-
star—asks
the gearbox manufacturer GearPro to
produce a new type of gear box,
the ‘SuperTrans’,
which is used exclusively by Autostar. The contract is
lucrative, but GearPro will have to undergo a funda-
mental transformation in order to get the contract, that
is, it will have to make a speciﬁc investment by buying
new machinery that can be used solely for the pro-
duction of SuperTrans gear boxes. After undergoing
this transformation, GearPro is completely dependent
on Autostar since they are now GearPro’s only client.
Being opportunistic and well aware of this dependency,
Autostar can now demand a reduction in price for the
gear boxes, citing unforeseeable circumstances, eg a
ﬁnancial crisis: due to plummeting sales, the Super-
Trans boxes are no longer really needed; however,
Autostar would still be willing to buy them, albeit at a
signiﬁcantly reduced price. Seeing as GearPro has made
a signiﬁcant investment in producing the gear boxes,
and has no other potential clients to sell them to, they
are forced to accept a renegotiation of the contract
(Figure 2).

Another example is a law ﬁrm that has bought pro-
prietary software for handling cases electronically. Once
the software has been bought and installed, the law
ﬁrm can only change the software by incurring high
transaction costs, which arise due to having to adapt, ie
fundamentally transform, the existing system to a new
program. This fact can be easily exploited by the soft-
ware producer due to his improved bargaining position
in negotiations, eg by increasing prices for software

amendments, maintenance, or updates. Since the law
ﬁrm is aware of this potential for a hold-up situation
before signing the sale contract, it will tend to refrain
from buying such proprietary software, even if that
particular product constitutes the best solution to the
ﬁrm’s software needs.

As we have seen above, a hold-up situation arises
when a ﬁrm has made a speciﬁc investment relating to
a contract, thereby opening itself up to being exploited
by its contract partner due to an effectuated depend-
ency. To the degree that the exploited party has no
alternative, the exploiter can theoretically demand up
to 100 per cent of proﬁts. A prudent company will,
however, anticipate such a hold-up attempt and
subsequently avoid contracts requiring this type of
speciﬁc investment.

Figure 3 shows a sample decision tree for two com-
panies A and B, with their associated payoffs at the end
of each branch. Company A, in anticipation of a hold-

up attempt by B, will choose not to invest speciﬁcally,
thereby earning a payoff of 10, rather than risking a
payoff of 0. The optimal solution would be a speciﬁc
investment accompanied by no exploit resulting in a
payoff of 150 for each company.

termed underinvestment,
meaning that even though the highest payoffs would be
achieved by the two parties working together, they do
not, on account of the dynamic described above. Thus
the hold-up problem leads to inefﬁcient outcomes as
long as no suitable governance mechanism is found
that mitigates the risk of a hold-up and allows the
companies to cooperate safely.

Generally speaking, the cost of governing a trans-
action rise dramatically with its level of speciﬁcity; thus
an in-house solution becomes increasingly efﬁcient as
factor
transactions
involving only a low degree of speciﬁcity are best
carried out on the competitive market. Accordingly,

speciﬁcity increases. Conversely,

factor speciﬁcity is one of the factors which determines
the organizational structure and size of a ﬁrm.5

One typical way to avoid hold-up problems is for
the ﬁrms to merge, a tactic known as vertical inte-
gration, or to enter vertical agreements, eg an agree-
ment with a non-compete clause.

Can horizontal patents alleviate
the hold-up problem?
H patents belong to a single manufacturer and exhibit
a scope of protection which affects a company located
in the value chain ahead of or after the manufacturer.
In a similar fashion to V patents, H patents have the
potential to strengthen the relationship between two
ﬁrms bound by contract. In addition, and perhaps
more importantly, they have the ability to mitigate the
risk posed by contractual gaps.

If the ﬁrm considering a speciﬁc investment owns a
patent directly affecting the operations of its contract
partner, eg a potential client, that contract partner will
not be able to exploit the ﬁrm due to the interdepend-
ency effectuated by the patent.

Recalling our previous example,

imagine GearPro
holding a patent on one of the machines used in Auto-
star’s manufacturing process. In such a case, Autostar
would not be able to exploit any existing contractual
gaps without running the risk of being hit in its own
production capability by GearPro.

Likewise, imagine the law ﬁrm owning a patent on
software distributed by the software producer. Such a
patent would effectively shield the law ﬁrm from any
hold-up attempt by the software producer by giving it
the capability to exercise prohibitive rights on their
production.

Since H patents not only increase the mutual
interdependency between two contracting ﬁrms
in
horizontal direction but also have the potential to ﬁll
out contractual gaps, they inﬂuence the outcome of
these contracts positively. Thus the exploitation of a
speciﬁc investment can be avoided by H patents, allow-
ing for cooperation between ﬁrms and promoting efﬁ-
cient market solutions. From a manufacturer’s point of
view, it now becomes possible to outsource the pro-
duction of patent-protected services and goods, which
reduces the size of the ﬁrm and increases proﬁts.

The social costs frequently associated with the mon-
opolization gains arising from strong patens are out-
weighed by the efﬁciency gains brought about by

that alleviate the hold-up
governance mechanisms
problem.6 In this sense, H patents not only beneﬁt the
involved ﬁrms by safeguarding their speciﬁc invest-
ments from exploitation, but also contribute to the
national economy by reducing the high social costs
associated with inefﬁcient market outcomes.

H patents thus represent a more versatile and valu-
able tool than V patents, and can be very helpful when
making strategic decisions concerning, for example, the
outsourcing of production and the increasing of
company proﬁts.

In summary, H patents increase interdependency
between two contracting ﬁrms, thereby also serving as
effective governance mechanisms for mitigating the risk
posed by contractual gaps. Thus, in terms of value, H
patents are truly superior and mighty patents.

External (E) patents
E patents are rights that do not affect an existing
relationship between two given companies at all, as
shown in Figure 1 by patents E1 and E2. In other
words, neither
legal
stand-off positions with competing ﬁrms, nor formal
relationships, such as contracts with clients, must be
taken into consideration when deciding on how to best
employ the patent. Because of this, E patents constitute
the most valuable and mighty form of IP right, offering
the broadest variety of possible exertions; they allow
the owner to enter the market using the patents in
either a vertical or horizontal fashion, as well as enable
him to charge licence fees or exert his prohibitive rights
directly.

Blends
In contrast to the simpliﬁed view of clearly deﬁned and
neat characteristics, most patents must be regarded as a
blend of all previously mentioned patent forms since
they regularly exhibit characteristics of H, V, and E
patents concurrently. In reality, the scope of patents
tends to extend in a vertical rather than a horizontal
manner; thus those characteristics attributed primarily
to horizontal patents dominate in most cases. This
blended nature of patents is especially clear in view of
the fact that real supply chains are far more complex
than the one depicted in Figure 1.

reduction in the scope of the patent on account of the
exclusion of some of its parts. In particular, the seller
will often try to avoid later IP attacks by the buyer by
means of non-interference clauses. The smaller ellipse
in Figure 4 indicates this change in the patent’s scope.

To this end, verticalization tends to reduce the scope of
a patent’s actual employability. However, as seen from the
viewpoint of the upper gear producer, purchasing a right
affecting a direct competitor, eg, the lower gear box pro-
ducer, might be a reasonable measure when having a
weak IP position and there is a subsequent need to deter
hostile attacks against the IP. From the viewpoint of the
lower gear producer, verticalization, ie selling a patent,
seems rational so long as he holds further patents inﬂuen-
cing his horizontal relationships and thus shielding him
from potential hold-up attempts.

Horizontalization
In contrast
to verticalization, horizontalization of
patents means rotating V patents into the horizontal
plane. As above, horizontalization of patents can be
achieved by transferring the patent, which again is
sometimes accompanied by a reduction in its scope of
legal protection.

Nevertheless, turning a V patent into an H patent
often increases
the patent and its
associated value, since actually enforceable rights of H
patents exceed those of V patents (Figure 5).

Externalization
Externalization is the term for selling a patent (ZV, LV,
V or H) to a ﬁrm which has no relationship to the pro-
tected subject-matter. This could be, for example, a
patent troll or a ﬁrm operating in a different techno-
logical area,
from informal
restrictions.

thus freeing the patent

Sophisticated patent strategies (SPS)
The three tactical measures of verticalization, horizon-
talization, and externalization can be further combined
into more sophisticated strategies
cross-
verticalization,
in which two ﬁrms mutually transfer
patents to each other in order to establish vertical
relationships; cross-horizontalization,
in which two
ﬁrms mutually exchange patents, eg V patents, in order
to establish horizontal relationships; or horizontaliza-
tion – verticalization, in which one ﬁrm horizontalizes a
patent, and the other ﬁrm counters this by verticalizing
another.7

such as

Figure 4. The concept of verticalization.

Figure 5. The concept of horizontalization.

As an example, Figure 1 shows a blended ZV/H/V
patents, with a scope extending in both a vertical as
well as a horizontal direction.

Building blocks
The key to designing general patent strategies is under-
standing that the patent characteristics described above
can be easily modiﬁed, eg by transforming a V patent
into an H patent. Thus every change in the individual
characteristics of a patent can serve as a building block
for a more effective underlying strategy.

The most important building blocks for designing
more effective and SPS—measures that are based on
already existing rights—can be denoted as verticaliza-
tion, horizontalization, and externalization.

Verticalization
Verticalization of patents is the term used for turning
an H patent into a V patent. H patents affect the tech-
nological areas in which suppliers and demanders of
the patent-owning company operate. Verticalization of
H patents can be achieved easily by transferring the
patent to a competitor of the demander or supplier in
question. This process of patent verticalization is repre-
sented in Figure 4. The arrow indicates that ownership
of the patent is transferred from the lower gear produ-
cer to the upper one.

The legal scope of a patent is not directly affected by
the process of verticalization and remains unchanged.
However, verticalization can be accompanied by a

Owner-dependent commercial
evaluation
The illustration above shows that the value of an IP
right strongly depends on who owns it; although the
formal rights granted by a patent remain the same, the
informal rights change.

In summary:

- V patents serve mainly as economic defence mech-
anisms for deterring hostile IP-attacks. Their poten-
tial for actively inﬂuencing economic relationships
is low. Correspondingly, their economic value tends
to be lower than that of H patents.

- H patents are superior to V patents in terms of
value. They are mighty tools for preventing undesir-
able situations, such as hold-up problems, which
are frequently associated with unavoidable contrac-
tual gaps. In this sense, H patents can serve as effec-
tive tools for actively designing and/or governing
contractual relationships.

- E patents, ie patents that can be utilized to the full
extent of their legal potential due to the absence of
any existing relationships, are most valuable. In E
patents formal and actually exercisable rights come
together, thus making E patents the most valuable
form of IP right.

Beyond their equal formal rights, V, H, and E patents
all have within them certain informal rights, varying in
nature and strength. The ability to use these rights to
their full extent, however, depends strongly on who
actually owns the patent in question; each patent holds
a particular economic value that
increases in pro-
portion to the measure of informal rights that can be
accessed by a given owner. Thus transferring ownership
of a patent, or changing the supply chain environment
of a ﬁrm, can cause shifts not only with respect to the
classiﬁcation of the patent, but also with respect to its
economic valuation, eg as might be relevant
for
accounting issues.

In practice, transferring a patent to a patent troll
often drastically increases the informal rights of a patent
and, subsequently, its associated monetary value. In this
respect,
types of
patents—even LV patents—can become dangerous and
mighty weapons when they fall into ‘the wrong hands’,
that is, when they are externalized.

it should also be noted that all

rises
consistently,
from LV patents at the low end to E
patents at the high end. Which monetary value is to be
contributed to a patent
largely depends on (a) its
inherent formal rights, ie the scope of protection, and
(b) informal rights determined by the exercisability of
the same in relation to the owner.
