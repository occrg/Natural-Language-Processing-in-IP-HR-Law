Is copyright good for music?
Andreas Rahmatian*

‘Is copyright good for music?’—The short answer is:
no. However, this answer comes with a qualiﬁcation:
copyright is not necessarily bad for music, but rather is
in a neutral relationship with it, provided copyright is
applied in a meaningful and considerate way. This,
however, seems to have become a problem.

When Haydn travelled to London for the second
time,1 a charity concert in his honour was given in
London on 4 May 1795; he earned 4000 guilders or
ﬂorin (Gulden)2 from this event alone.3 He then wrote
into his diary:
‘So etwas kann man nur in England
machen’ (‘You can do anything like that in England
only’).4 This statement is not only one of
joy, but
rather of dark ambiguity: virtually everything which he
(had) performed during his ﬁrst trip, and a large pro-
portion of his performances during his second stay,
was composed at home in the Habsburg Empire,
mostly in Eszterha´za (now Ferto¨d, Hungary) and Eisen-
stadt at his prince’s residences, where he was a servant
and employee. There was no copyright protection then
in those countries: no copyright protection could have
instigated him to compose, and he would not have
been able to draw any income from it. He lived a
rather cut-off existence for decades, in some kind of
musical laboratory,5 with his prince’s ﬁne court orches-
tra, where he developed the symphony and its instru-
mentation further, wrote operas, and practically single-
handedly invented the musical
the string
quartet. He was the employee of a paternalistic and
magniﬁcent, but generally benign and music-loving
prince, Nicholas I. Esterha´zy (1714– 1790).

from copyright. His invitation was a business venture:
Johann Peter Salomon, the London concert entrepre-
neur and broker of the concert events in which Haydn
was supposed to have his new symphonies performed,
invited Haydn because he already had a famous name.
This would enable Salomon to make money for himself
and for Haydn. London was subject to the Statute of
Anne 1710—by
applicability had been
extended to musical works through the court decision
of Bach v Longman.6 When Haydn appeared in
London, this business deal illustrated that works not
created in the context of a copyright regime were now
marketed within a copyright regime. Perhaps, because

were more advanced in England in the late 18th
century.

Exploitation is not necessarily the creation of music.
Who were the most famous composers in London for
the best part of the 18th century? They were mainly
imports from the Continent, where there was no copy-
right: Handel, J.S. Bach’s youngest son, Johann Chris-
tian Bach, who was incidentally the plaintiff in the
Longman case just mentioned. Once England was
unquestionably one of the leading countries for music
in Europe, with composers
such as Tallis, Byrd,
Gibbons, Dowland, Blow, and—arguably still matchless
for his time—Henry Purcell (died 1695). But the ﬁnal
zenith of classical music in England was reached just
before the Statute of Anne, the ﬁrst Copyright Act in
the world, was passed. A coincidence? Perhaps. But
anybody who possesses any understanding of classical
music must admit that the classical music not com-
posed by immigre´s in the late 18th and beginning of
the 19th centuries in England was secondary in quality
and creativity in comparison to what happened in Italy,
Austria, Germany, France, and other countries during
that time.7

Haydn probably had the happiest and most suc-
cessful
to
England. But when he was urged repeatedly to settle
permanently in London, he declined. He, as an
elderly artist, probably knew that
this time was a
golden crown to his career, but place and circum-
stances were not necessarily a fertile ground for cre-
ative composing: ‘So etwas kann man nur in England
machen’ (‘You can do anything like that in England
only’). It depends what you intend to do. One may,
sometimes, be able to make money out of music, but
never music out of money.

Creation vexploitation: a state of
tension
This tension between the creative process and the
exploitation of the results of such a creative process
with the aid of copyright seems to be at the centre of
the question whether copyright
is indeed good for

legalistic
music. Strictly speaking, from a positivistic,
point of view, one could perceive copyright thus: copy-
right protection freezes the ﬂuid process of artistic
creativity and thus turns it into a static, immutable
product for the purpose of the law by granting it the
status of a property. This can be likened to the photo-
graph of a moving creature. However, this crystalliza-
tion or ‘propertisation’ of the artistic process is an
abstract legal concept and not part of the physical
world: copyright as such does not freeze or otherwise
disable the artistic process in the material world itself.
Copyright rules do not prescribe a certain human be-
haviour which amounts to the control of artistic cre-
ativity in some way. This can be demonstrated by the
way in which the copyright protection of earlier drafts
of a work operates. Each earlier draft attracts copyright
protection independently.8 Thus copyright attaches
even to the smallest discernible stage of the develop-
ment of an artistic work if it contains sufﬁcient orig-
inality in the
law.
Copyright does not therefore direct the artistic process
but follows it: each draft of a physical work equals the
concept of a (static) copyright work for the purpose of
the law, but copyright law creates a potentially un-
limited number of these conceptual ‘stills’, as many as
the artistic process requires, and represents them as a
notional strip of frames, like a ﬁlm. Accordingly, the
concept of copyright per se does not freeze the process
of artistic creativity in the real world.9

By conferring protection, copyright law thus turns a
musical creation into property. Copyright does not
protect creativity as such, nor does it nurture it, but
only attaches to it if it happens anyway. Copyright, at
least in the UK, only protects the potential economic
value of the product of someone’s own skill, labour,
and effort, whether creative (inventive) or not, and it
covers works where a creative input is hardly detect-
able.10 The protection of products of artistic creativity
is in fact only a corollary of the overall protection
concept of copyright which could be likened to the
protection against unfair competition of the format
found in continental European countries:11 the prohibi-
tion of taking a short cut, which Walter v Lane12

already stressed, and Sawkins v Hyperion13 reiterated
for musical works, reﬂects the basic idea of protection
against ‘free riding’ as a practice of unfair competition.
This idea is at least one essential aspect of UK copy-
right protection.

It is for this reason that copyright need not be par-
ticularly concerned about what kind of work artistically
a creation in question is, as long as it is a ‘work’ in the
normative,
technical sense of copyright. Sawkins v
Hyperion demonstrated that drastically with regard to
musical works. According to the partial deﬁnition in
the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988, section
3(1), a ‘musical work’ is a ‘work consisting of music’
(exclusive of words and dance). Sawkins showed that
this is not a circular deﬁnition. What the claimant
Sawkins had done was to reinstate baroque music by
Michel-Richard De Lalande (1657– 1726), but he never
purported to have composed new or original, that is
creative, music: he claimed that he made a restoration
which sought to come as close as possible to the orig-
inal as it presumably sounded when Lalande composed
it some 300 years ago. Yet Sawkins could assert copy-
right in his edition successfully. What he produced was
a ‘musical work’ and, in that, he fulﬁlled the technical,
normative category of the law as the ﬁrst step to copy-
right protection, but he did not—and did not intend
to—produce what musicians, a concert audience, or
musicologists would consider ‘music’. To them, ‘music’
would be Lalande’s music—restored. One has to read
the words ‘musical work’ as a technical term of the law,
a normative, formalistic creation, and categorization.14
Furthermore, it is not even essential whether the cre-
ation in question could ﬁt into more than one category
of work as provided by copyright law, as long as it ﬁts
into at least one. Aesthetic deﬁnitions of art theory
obviously mirror in the history of copyright law and
the existing categories of literary, dramatic, musical,
and artistic works, but
their borders have become
blurred and they are not of constitutive importance for
protection.15 In addition, nobody really knows what
music actually is, and the law rightly avoids a positive
deﬁnition. Accordingly, a creation can be a sound

sculpture or installation and, depending on the facts of
the individual case, may be an artistic and musical
work at the same time, if its artistic element (if dis-
tinguishable) can be ascertained according to the prin-
ciples of protection for artistic works, while the music
component would be subject to the protection prin-
ciples for musical works, so far as there are differences
between these categories.

Copyright and social reality
While this account of copyright law may be technically
correct, it is not complete. It does not take sufﬁcient
notice of social reality. The law is never better than its
actors.

When the effect of creativity, copyright protection,
tips over into the cause of creativity, copyright can
indeed become detrimental to music. The entertain-
ment industries today build up, at great expense, ‘star
artists’ and celebrity performers, manufacture songs
and music which are tailored to a perceived demand of
the ‘market’ of listeners,16 irrespective of any artistic
integrity or quality. This is art drawn with an account-
ant’s pen. Invariably, such musical production has to
go for a conventional, mild-mannered middle ground,
but usually ornamented with a cheeky non-conformist
image which people—quite conservatively—expect to
see in a young performer. This bureaucratized non-
conformism is an excellent device that conceals from
musicians and their listeners the fact that they are
merely producers and consumers, usually of somebody
else’s (intellectual) property—and that is in fact their
principal purpose. Copyright is the legal tool for such
manipulative market practices. Since the goal for the
large copyright holders,
the entertainment corpora-
tions, is to generate ever more copyright property, it
matters little what the content of that property consists
in. It only has to sell. It is possible that today none of
the iconic pop bands of the 1960s would have any
chance to be promoted by one of the large enter-
tainment businesses. They would be
considered
artistically too demanding, and the returns would be

language of North J. in another case: “For the purposes of their own
proﬁt they desire to reap where they have not sown, and to take
advantage of the labour and expenditure of the plaintiffs in procuring
news for the purpose of saving labour and expense to themselves”.’

13 Sawkins v Hyperion [2005] RPC 32, especially paras 30 and 87: ‘The

solution accords with a reasonable view of public policy - that the sort of
work done by the claimant should be encouraged. It saves others the time
and trouble of recreation of near-lost works, but in no sense creates
monopoly in them. If someone wants to use the claimant’s short cut,
they need his permission.’

unruly youths have high artistic merit. And even so,

of an extended copyright term for sound recordings is
that such protection promotes the creation of new
music through subsidies ﬁnanced by sales of successful
recordings from the back catalogue. If that were so,
then why is the music industry pressing for an exten-
sion of the copyright term for sound recordings? If the
revenue from successful record sales of older music had
been used for the support of new music, then that
would certainly have nourished a sufﬁcient number of
commercially successful artists in the past 20 or so
years who can now make up for the expected shortfall
of income as a result of the old hits gradually going
out of copyright. As it appears now, the record industry
seeks to obtain an extended monopoly right as a statu-
tory subsidy for potential commercial incompetence in
the past.18 It is noteworthy that the impending amend-
ment of the EU Term Directive, which requires that
sound recordings be protected for 70, rather than 50
years,19 deals not with the creative works of copyright,

such as music and lyrics of songs, but with the un-
creative ones, the sound recordings. A sound recording
is really not more than switching on a tape recorder or
other recording device, and that is the essence of what
happens in any recording studio.20 But copyright pro-
vides the tool for generating income through the sound
recording exploitation, apparently increasingly almost
without a limit in duration.

copyright, with its infringement provisions and the
additional shield of security through technological pro-
tection measures, provides a sharp weapon. An overpro-
tective attitude may, however, eventually destroy the
copyright system altogether in the near future. Now a
whole generation of teenagers, about to reach adulthood,
has grown up under the prevailing impression that many
of most natural social activities which are connected with
making friends, sharing experiences, and enjoying music
are only achieved by constantly breaking the law. How
could these teenagers possibly be expected to accept and
respect the idea of copyright in principle if any sound
recording they copy for their friends, any song they
download onto their iPods, and most songs and clips
they download from the internet and share with their
mates are invariably acts of copyright infringement?21
How can a teenager establish an untwisted relationship
to social moral values if boisterous corporate copyright
enforcers, condoned by the law, can label such youths as
‘thieves’, conveniently glossing over the fact that ‘classical’
theft involves the deprivation of a resource, while copy-
right infringement typically involves the further dissemi-
nation of a resource? At the same time, iPods and other
sound recording copying devices are aggressively mar-
keted to teenagers as future customers, although what
else could one normally do with them other than
infringe copyright? But
the law
ensures their legality—and thereby preserves commercial
interests—by ruling that selling such equipment has no
authorization to infringe copyright because it is up to
the operator of the equipment whether to infringe or
not: the manufacturers of such products in no way

Teenagers may not know all complexities of human
society, but they have a ﬁne sensorium for the hypoc-
risy of rules adults subject them to, and the corrosive
effect of such hypocrisy on the development of moral
values is well-known—and copyright entails a lot of
hypocrisy. If a music teacher wants to give copies of
sheet music of the parts of a string quartet to her
pupils
she
strictly speaking must either ask them to buy the
scores individually, which they may not be able to
afford, or stop teaching; she cannot legally photocopy
them, because sheet music is
speciﬁcally excluded
from the permitted acts.23 In fact, today much of our
teaching and research would no longer be possible

for practice or examination purposes,

without infringing copyright to a signiﬁcant extent,
yet we pretend that the copyright system, as it is,

it dictates the existence of music.
