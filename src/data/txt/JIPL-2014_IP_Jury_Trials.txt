IP jury trials—trouble ahead?
Robert M. Kunstadt*

For many years, jury trials in IP cases in the United
States were rare. The IP bar was small and specialized—
mainly patent attorneys with little jury-trial experience.
More recently, jury trials expanded on to the IP scene
until the demand for a jury trial in an IP case, in particu-
lar a patent case, regularly became a matter of course.
Certain jurisdictions perceived to have a jury pool fa-
vourable to patent owners, such as the Eastern District
of Texas, became magnets for patent litigation.

What if these developments were based on an errone-
ous view of the jury trial right? IP litigation would look
very different. Strike suits by ‘trolls’ might ﬁnd less fa-
vourable reception before judges than juries.

One of the measures instituted in reaction to the per-
ceived plague of patent trolls might be pointing the way
to a sea change not only in patent litigation but in all
kinds of IP litigation including trade marks and copy-
rights. The creation of a Patent Trial and Appeal Board
(PTAB) to preside over quasi-trials of patent validity
after the fact at the United States Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce (USPTO) raises substantial issues of constitution-
al law that, properly understood, have far-ranging impli-
cations for IP trial practice in general.

Historical recognition of IP
jury-trial rights
The right to jury trial is preserved by the US Constitu-
tion, as a safeguard for the populace against governmen-
tal abuse of the type that led to the American Revolution
against the British Crown. Ironically, the yardstick for
the jury trial right is (to this day) the scope of the right
as it existed under British common law. Thus a case that
would have been tried to a jury in England during pre-
revolutionary times is also entitled to be tried to a US
jury today. Conversely, the scope of the constitutional
right today is no wider than at that early time.

The Constitution also provided for so-called ‘Article
III courts’, in which the judges serve for life. This is in
contrast to ‘Article I courts’, which are administrative tri-
bunals with judges or magistrates appointed for limited
terms. Lifetime service is considered to promote judicial

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2014, Vol. 9, No. 8

Article I courts generally preside over administrative-
law matters, such as regulatory licences (eg at the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), concerning broad-
cast licences) or tax disputes (US Tax Court).

The newly created PTAB is an Article I court, since its
judges do not serve for life. Nor is there any right to jury
trial before the PTAB. Among its duties, the PTAB may
preside over and rule upon contested (inter partes) pro-
ceedings to revoke issued US patents. Such proceedings
may commence prior to any related litigation before the
Article III courts (US District Courts); they may proceed
in parallel; or cases before the Article III courts may be
stayed pending resolution of the related PTAB proceed-
ings. At least, that is how it has worked to date.

The right to jury trials in IP cases is supported by sub-
stantial case law at the US Supreme Court. For example,
in copyright, trade mark and patent matters.

The ‘public right’ exception to jury trial
As is well documented in a comprehensive review by
Rothwell, the jury trial right permits a limited exception
in the case of a so-called ‘public right’.1 The original doc-
trinal basis for this exception is that, where the govern-
ment itself seeks to correct its own prior mistaken
action, it is permitted to undo what it has done—wholly
of its own accord, without seeking jury intervention.
The so-called ‘public right’, in contradistinction to a
purely private right, has therefore been found deserving
of a special status of immunity beﬁtting its nature as a
creation of the sovereign.

It has thus been held that the USPTO is entitled to
‘re-examine’ and if necessary revoke an issued patent if,
subsequent to issuance, grounds for invalidity appear.2
Similarly, the patent owner him/herself may seek to have
a patent ‘re-issued’ due to mistake in its original pros-
ecution.3

In the case of a public right, the jury trial safeguard
does not apply. We may suppose this is similar to the

right.’

6 Precision Instrument Mfg Co v Automotive Co, 324 US 806, 816 (1945):

A patent, by its very nature, is affected with a public interest. . . . [It] is
an exception to the general rule against monopolies, and to the right
to access to a free and open market. The far-reaching social and

revocation of a broadcast licence by the FCC. In terms of
logic, the theory might be conceptualized on the basis of
an analogy: ‘The Lord hath given and the Lord hath
taken away’.4

IP rights as ‘public rights’
Considerable tension exists between the concept of IP
rights as public rights and the maintenance of a jury trial
right in such cases. Indeed, it has been persuasively
argued that acknowledgement of the existence of a
public right is fundamentally and irreconcilably incon-
sistent with maintenance of the jury trial right.5

By their nature, IP rights seem well suited to acknowl-
edgement as ‘public rights’. There are several reasons. IP
rights work against the entire world, unlike a contract
right that binds only the subscribed contracting parties;
or tort claims that are between only the injured party-
plaintiff and the alleged tortfeasor-defendant. IP rights
implicate a manifest public interest, because they restrict
the scope of lawful trade that is permissible in the public
marketplace.6 IP rights are thus in tension with princi-
ples of free competition and anti-monopoly and thus
have been recognized as in need of appropriate limita-
tion in various instances.7

In particular, patent rights apply against even inde-
pendent creation at practically the same time; the loser
of a ‘race to the patent ofﬁce’ is restricted for a 20-year
term from practising the fruits of his/her own labours—
regardless of the resulting waste of R&D effort and
expense.8

Trade mark rights similarly apply even against ‘inno-
cent infringers’, although the scope of relief in such cases
may be limited to injunctions without imposition of
monetary damages.9

Copyright law at ﬁrst glance seems less restrictive
than IP rights in the nature of patents and trade marks,
since copyrights may only be infringed if actual copying
has taken place; independent creation of a substantially

economic consequences of a patent, therefore, give the public a
paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies spring from
backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable conduct, and that
such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope.

Robert M. Kunstadt . IP jury trials—trouble ahead?

ARTICLE

similar work is no infringement of copyright.10 However,
downstream dealers in the copied work need not have
performed the copying themselves, so there may be sub-
stantial risks to the unwary dealing in such works.11 Es-
pecially in today’s fast-paced internet economy, First
Amendment rights of ‘free speech’ and ‘fair use’ defences
are increasingly being recognized to excuse even actual
copying, due to the asserted need for fair comment upon
the creative works of others—even to the point of
repeated reproduction of substantial portions of the
copyright original work within the alleged new and ‘fair’
work.12

In today’s economy, it seems more certain than ever
that copyright law cannot fail to implicate issues of sub-
stantial public interest under the First Amendment in
many instances.

Implications of the ‘public right’ analysis
for IP jury trials
It seems fairly certain that IP rights, in particular patent
rights, are not going to be withdrawn from the category
of ‘public rights’ any time soon. All the more so, since to
do so would (as a matter of logic) compel the conclusion
that the newly created PTAB tribunal acts unconstitu-
tionally when it deprives a patent owner of the right to
jury trial.

Some may wish to counter-argue that there can be no
right to jury trial on patent validity, in a case in which a
PTAB proceeding is initiated by a ‘Good Samaritan’ dis-
interestedly intent upon purging the patent record of
‘deadwood’, purely as a public service. Since there is not
even a ‘case or controversy’ that has arisen in such an in-
stance—a requirement for initiating a trial in the Federal
courts—there could not be any right to a jury trial either
(a fortiori). We may for purposes of analysis assume the
truth of that proposition. However, it hardly ends the
analysis. We must also consider the ‘hard case’, as well.
Suppose a patent owner has detected an infringement

and soundly initiated litigation in Federal court, meeting
the requirement of an ‘actual case or controversy’, and
has preserved his/her right to jury trial by ﬁling a timely
jury demand. The accused-infringer/defendant responds
by starting a PTAB proceeding to invalidate the patent-
in-suit, and moves in the district court to stay litigation
pending determination of validity by the PTAB.

This is far from a ﬁctional, hypothetical case. Motions
litigation,
are regularly ﬁled to stay district court
whether to await the outcome of PTAB proceedings
since the America Invents Act was implemented, or
(even before that new law was passed) to stay district
court cases pending patent re-examination proceedings.
Such motions are not always granted; but many are
granted.

The concern implicated by those very real cases, is
that the patent owner stands to be deprived of the right
to a jury trial—in an actual case or controversy with a
speciﬁc accused infringer—due to intervening invalida-
tion of the patent-in-suit by an Article I tribunal acting
without beneﬁt of a jury.13

The Supreme Court unmistakably holds that once a
valid jury demand has been interposed in a case, there is
no basis to deprive the plaintiff of a jury determination.
Provided the case is one in which the jury trial right has
been recognized at English common law (or one analo-
gous to it), the jury trial must proceed.

For example,

in a copyright case, Justice Thomas

reasoned:

The Seventh Amendment thus applies not only to common-
law causes of action, but also to ‘actions brought to enforce
statutory rights that are analogous to common-law causes
of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late
18th century, as opposed to those customarily heard by
courts of equity or admiralty.’ Granﬁnanciera, S. A. v Nord-
berg, 492 U. S. 33, 42 (1989) (citing Curtis v Loether, 415
U. S., at 193). To determine whether a statutory action is
more analogous to cases tried in courts of law than to suits
tried in courts of equity or admiralty, we examine both the
nature of the statutory action and the remedy sought.14

12 See eg Cariou v Prince, 714 F 3d 694 (2d Cir 2013). The case was settled in

2014, after the Second Circuit’s ruling but before further proceedings in the
district court to implement it. ‘Artist Prince, Photographer Cariou Settle
Fair Use Feud’, IP360 (19 March 2014), http://www.law360.com (accessed
19 March 2014).

13 Other interesting controversies surround the newly created PTAB. For

example, a PTAB ruling on patent invalidity has been held by the Federal
Circuit to trump a prior district court ruling, despite its having been
afﬁrmed by the Federal Circuit itself on an interim basis, on grounds that
since litigation in the district court had not yet been concluded, there was
no ﬁnal precedential decision on validity. Fresenius USA, Inc v Baxter Int’l,

Inc, 2013 US App LEXIS 13484 (Fed Cir 2013) (‘Fresenius II’). Similarly,
the PTAB itself has ruled that it is not bound to follow a district court’s
claim interpretations as precedent. SAP America, Inc v Versata Development
Group, Inc, CBM2012-0001, slip op 28 (PTAB 11 June 2013) (‘SAP’). The
present article focuses on the jury trial right, which was not implicated in
Fresenius II since in that case validity was determined by the district court
on summary judgment. A trial court may always decide a case summarily,
without submission to a jury, if there is no genuine issue of fact for the jury
to deliberate. Nor was the jury trial right implicated in SAP, since under
current authority claim interpretation is a matter of law never subjected to
jury determination. Markman v Westview Instruments, Inc, 52 F 3d 967
(Fed Cir 1995) (en banc), aff ’d, 116 S Ct 1384 (1996); Cybor Corporation v
Fas Technologies, Inc, 122 F 3d 46 (Fed Cir 1997).

However, the jury trial right previously recognized in IP
cases including patent cases, seems now to be in substan-
tial danger of backsliding in patent cases due to increas-
ing reliance upon the PTAB as an end-run around jury
trials in district court.15

A Magistrate Judge in Texas district court, handling a
patent jury trial by consent of the parties, recently
decided that a ﬁnal verdict in favor of the patent owner
which had been upheld on appeal, should not be stayed
pending completion of PTAB invalidity proceedings.
This decision itself may still be appealed to the Federal
Circuit. The result might have been 180 degrees oppos-
ite, if there had not yet been a ﬁnal court decision with a
completed appeal: in that event, the case might have
been taken from the jury. Versata v SAP, Case No. 2:07-
cv-00153-RSP (E.D. Tx
21 April 2014) (Magistrate
Judge Payne).

What seems noteworthy is that if it can be done in the
case of patents—despite precedental case law upholding
the right to a jury trial in patent cases—then there seems
to be no sound logical basis to prevent extension of this
innovative procedure to trade mark and copyright cases
as well.

It has already been shown above, how trade marks
and copyrights implicate the ‘public rights’ doctrine
every bit as much as patents. Accordingly, to the sub-
stantial extent that trade marks and copyrights are also
‘public rights’, there seems to be doctrinal basis to
subject those IP rights to the very same treatment. At a
minimum, therefore, Congress may similarly establish
Article I tribunals at the Trademark Ofﬁce and at the
Copyright Ofﬁce,
to rule administratively without
beneﬁt of jury input upon the validity of issued trade
marks and copyrights.

This is not as far-fetched as it seems at ﬁrst glance,
since the Trademark Ofﬁce already has a tribunal that
rules upon the validity of issued trade mark registra-
tions: the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) is
empowered to act, upon petition of an interested party,
to cancel a registered trade mark. To date, the TTAB has
taken a very modest view of its power, vis-a`-vis the dis-
trict courts. If the TTAB learns that a district court pro-
ceeding is pending at
the same time as a TTAB

15 T Dutra ‘PTAB Now Four-for-Four in Cancelling Covered Business

Method Patent Claims’ Patent, Trademark & Copyright Law Daily (29
January 2014), http://www.bna.com/ptab-fourforfour-cancelling-
n17179881708/ (accessed 31 January 2014); Interthinx, Inc v CoreLogic
Solutions, LLC, PTAB, No CBM2012-00007 (1/30/14) (USPTO’s Patent
Trial and Appeal Board rules that is not precedentially bound to follow
prior district court decisions on patentability or validity).

16 37 CFR 2.117, Suspension of proceedings:

Whenever it shall come to the attention of the Trademark Trial and
Appeal Board that a party or parties to a pending case are engaged in

proceeding, the TTAB’s practice is to suspend the pro-
ceeding before it—until termination of the district court
action.16 Generally, TTAB determinations have not been
considered binding as precedents upon the district
courts or to give rise to res judicata or stare decisis bars.17
This has been justiﬁed, inter alia, upon the theory that
the TTAB resolves only the right to Federal registration,
whereas the district court may also resolve issues of right
to use.

However, if trade marks were recognized to enjoy the
full scope of a public right, as it seems they must deserve,
the groundwork would be laid for elevation of
the
TTAB—despite its status as a mere Article I tribunal—to
the same prerogatives now being exercised by the PTAB.
At a minimum, there would be little reason for the TTAB
to stay its proceedings in favour of the district courts.
Indeed, quite to the contrary, the district courts might
well wish to stay their proceedings in many instances in
order to await the beneﬁt of informed rulings by the
expert TTAB judges. Even if such TTAB rulings were not
ultimately recognized as binding upon the Article III dis-
trict courts and their juries, they might provide substan-
tial and welcome guidance in many cases.

Similarly, it is easy to envision creation of a like ad-
ministrative tribunal within the Copyright Ofﬁce,
charged with re-examining and revoking invalid copy-
rights. Indeed, the Copyright Ofﬁce itself, when issuing a
copyright, now makes no inquiry into its validity other
than upon purely formal grounds. Accordingly the only
way to invalidate a copyright is to engage in district
court litigation, a costly endeavour. Given the increasing
importance of copyrighted subject matter in modern
commerce, bearing in mind that computer software can
be copyright-protected ever since the CONTU commis-
sion recommendations18 resulted in the copyright law
amendments of 1976,19 an efﬁcient administrative pro-
cedure for revocation of invalid copyrights may be long
overdue.
Jeopardy of diminution
The jury trial right for IP cases, now logically seems in
substantial jeopardy of diminution. We may suppose
that success of the new PTAB proceedings in reducing

a civil action . . . which may have a bearing on the case, proceedings
before the Board may be suspended until termination of the civil
action . . . .
