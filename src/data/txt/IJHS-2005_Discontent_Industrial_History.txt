115000000December 2005Arguing that heritage sites offer a particularly porous boundary between anthropologists and
the discursive and social worlds of their informants, this article suggests that a public interest
approach to research at such sites has the potential to capitalise on that porosity in ways
that may be able to address anthropology’s traditional concerns with social inequality. The
article uses a case study of a folk-life demonstration at a US industrial heritage site to show
how anthropological analysis might move beyond simply documenting patterns of exclusion
and  exoticism.  By  participating  more  actively  in  forums  already  populated  by  heritage
professionals, convening new and more inclusive meeting grounds for discussion of heritage
issues, and producing broader ethnographic studies of heritage sites, anthropologists can
extend their analyses into more public and activist arenas, ultimately reframing the contem-
porary  anthropological  encounter  as  it  occurs  within  social  spaces  created  by  heritage
discourse.

Over the past two decades, often without intending or realising it, anthropologists and
other scholars interested in heritage have manoeuvred against a particularly porous
boundary between scholarship and practice, and between their own work and that of
the people they are studying. In investigating museums, nationalist cultural projects,
tourist productions and landscapes, and historic sites, scholars enter a world that abuts
their own in many ways. Because we are engaged in defining and debating precisely the
same cultural materials as our informants, we become de facto participants, for good
or ill, in the social arenas and discursive fields we study. In Charles Briggs’s terminology,
our own ‘meta-discursive’ practices—our discourses about discourse—very often place

us in a relationship with other social actors in the fields of knowledge production and
interpretation, of cultural definition, contestation, and display.1

Such participation contains the potential for both problems and opportunities. Thus
far, however, far more critical attention has been paid to the possible dangers of the
scholarly study of heritage than to the openings it presents for an expanded engage-
ment in the public sphere. From the perspective of anthropologists, this emphasis on
caution is not difficult to understand. Sensitive to the discipline’s historical links with
imperialist projects, and rightly cautious of the ways in which scholarly authority may
affect  public  perceptions  of  other  groups  or  expressions,  anthropologists  and  their
critics  alike  have  expressed  concern  over  the  effect  of  scholarship’s  deconstructive
approach to heritage, particularly as it arises from the ‘invention of tradition’ literature
that  emphasises  the  constructed,  syncretic,  strategic  nature  of  cultural  forms  often
promoted by their producers as timeless and authentic. As James Clifford notes, ‘In
normalizing impurity, we have questioned purist regimes of “authenticity”. But have
we always been attentive enough to the ways in which articulations of authenticity are
embedded  in  specific  historical  or  political  situations?’2  As  Briggs  points  out,  in
addition to extending scholarly control over the discourses of others, anthropological
deconstructions of ‘invented traditions’ and other cultural productions may actually
add  to  the  real-life  obstacles  faced  by  subordinated  groups,  who  often  choose  to
mobilise a ‘strategic essentialism’ as a political tool.

These concerns have prompted a greater reflexivity among many who study heritage
productions. But as yet there has been little sustained effort to move beyond critique or
awareness and towards the task of theorising the complex relationship between civic-
minded  scholars  and  heritage  practitioners—the  curators,  museum  educators,  tour
guides, exhibit designers, and others who are both colleagues and subjects for those of
us investigating the heritage field. What is taking place across that porous boundary? Is
there a way to structure the encounter so that practitioners can draw on the strengths
of  academic  inquiry—primarily  the  attention  paid  in  recent  decades  to  unequal
relationships of power and the mechanisms by which they are created and sustained—
without the scholarly perspective dissolving into pure advocacy? How might a public
interest approach play a role in heritage studies that are rigorously critical yet respon-
sive  to  the  real-life  ramifications  of  all  actions  taken  within  the  fields  of  heritage
discourse  we  have  entered?  This  paper,  along  with  others  in  this  issue,  attempts  to
contribute to such a theorising, by examining a folk-life presentation observed during
dissertation fieldwork in the former industrial city of Lowell, Massachusetts. One of the
earliest  American  places  to  experience  the  shock  of  de-industrialisation,  Lowell  was
also  among  the  first  to  invest  heavily  in  now-widespread  revitalisation  techniques
based  on  history,  heritage,  culture,  and  tourism.  The  resulting  network  of  heritage
institutions and practitioners in the city provides an exceptionally dense and reflexive
environment  for  research  into  the  politics  and  poetics  of  heritage  discourse,  where
questions such as those posed above can usefully be considered. The paper begins by
describing  and  analysing  the  folk-life  event,  ‘Feasting  on  Lowell’,  focusing  on  the
factors that made it an unsatisfying and frustrating occasion for nearly all involved, and
one which troublingly reproduced conventional exoticising patterns of cultural display

despite the well-meaning attempts of its producers and performers. It then considers
some possible ways in which such an analysis might be extended into more public and
activist arenas, with an eye to reframing the contemporary anthropological encounter
as it occurs within social spaces created by heritage discourse.

Feasting on Lowell

Lowell  is  a  city  of  approximately  100,000  people,  25  miles  north-west  of  Boston.
Created  in  the  1820s  as  a  planned  manufacturing  community,  it  was  an  important
textile-producing centre for a century, until its major corporations moved elsewhere
in search of lower production costs. After the failure of various renewal proposals, a
broad  coalition  of  political,  business,  and  cultural  leaders  eventually  came  together
around the then-novel idea of using the city’s industrial and immigrant history as the
basis for economic and social revitalisation.3 The centrepiece of this project was an
innovative national park created in 1978. The park was designed to be not only the key
interpreter of Lowell’s history but also the catalyst for a wide variety of publicly- and
privately  funded  projects.  As  well  as  museum  exhibits  and  tours  provided  by  the
national park itself, these projects have included extensive landscape and architectural
improvements within a 55 ha historic preservation district, public performances and
festivals, public art installations, an industrial history education centre, sports facilities
and waterfront parks. Set against a backdrop of a regional shift from an industrial to a
post-industrial  economy  and  continuing  cycles  of  migration  that  have  seen  Lowell
become the second-largest Cambodian community in the USA and the home of many
thousands  of  Latino,  African,  and  Brazilian  immigrants  over  the  past  two  decades,
Lowell’s heritage revitalisation project has contributed significantly to the creation of
an improved image for this once-reviled city. Making a much more successful transi-
tion into post-industrialism than many comparable places in the region, Lowell now
boasts  a  physically  well-preserved  and  cared-for  19th-century  built  environment,  a
diversifying economic base with many ‘new economy’ businesses, a growing reputa-
tion as an attractive small urban setting, and—less positively—many of the character-
istics  of  emerging  post-industrial  places,  notably  a  widening  gap  between  rich  and
poor residents.

My fieldwork was conducted in Lowell’s heritage realm between 2000 and 2002. The
specific focus was on those who worked in the interpretive division of Lowell National
Historical  Park  (NHP).  I  was  interested  in  the  extent  to  which  these  academically
trained, generally left-leaning professional knowledge workers were able to bring criti-
cal perspectives into the public spaces of the new information- and service-based soci-
ety which they were charged with interpreting. In particular, I studied sites of cultural
production  where  public  historians  were  attempting  to  make  statements  about  the
contemporary city and its relationship to growing economic globalisation and global
flows of refugees and migrants. One such site was the Patrick J. Mogan Cultural Center,
named after the visionary Lowell educator who first proposed the idea of a heritage-
based revitalisation strategy in the late 1960s. Housed in a former textile corporation
boarding-house, the Mogan Center is part of a cluster of buildings and green spaces

that constitute the centre of gravity of the dispersed and far-flung national park (see
Figure 1).

Figure 1 The Patrick J. Mogan Cultural Center at Lowell National Historical Park.

The renovation of the boarding-house block and the adjacent performing arts space
at Boardinghouse Park was one of the proudest achievements of the Lowell Historic
Preservation Commission, a temporary federal agency created along with the park to
act as a development arm for the multifaceted revitalisation project. Skilfully making
use  of  cultural  activity  to  further  agendas  driven  largely  by  economic  concerns,  the
commission saw the Mogan Center and Boardinghouse Park as ways to draw people
and activity into the empty downtown area which was the focus of its redevelopment
efforts. The creation of the Mogan Center also reflected the insistence of local park
supporters that the national park should not simply tell a story of long-ago technolog-
ical and economic innovation, but should also forge interpretive and social connections
with the immigrant populations who comprised a majority of the city’s residents for
most of its history. When the national park was created in the late 1970s, this meant the
descendants of Irish, French Canadian, Greek, and other immigrants who had provided
the  textile  labour  force  during  the  city’s  industrial  heyday.  These  descendants,  now
firmly middle class, held the reins of much political and financial power in the city, and
had signed onto the heritage revitalisation plan in large part because they saw it as a way
of honouring their forebears and celebrating a vigorous sense of local culture and iden-
tity. The Mogan Cultural Center, then, was a place where professional public historians
at the national park came into close working contact with those who spoke for the city.
Completed in 1989, the centre housed an extensive local history archive run by the

International Journal of Heritage Studies

University of Massachusetts/Lowell, meeting and temporary exhibition spaces, and a
permanent exhibit about the working people of Lowell.

In its first five years, the Mogan Center hosted a fairly popular series of exhibitions
created by local residents with Preservation Commission assistance. But the consensus
among informants appeared to be, as one local cultural leader put it, ‘What didn’t work
out was somehow having the community drive this building … It didn’t take on the
character  of  a  community  cultural  centre  with  the  community  in  the  lead.’  This
appeared to be largely due to the prominent role played by the Preservation Commis-
sion.  Heavily  funded  and  dominant  within  the  heritage  revitalisation  effort,  it  had
significant local membership and tended to speak for ‘the community’ to the extent
that there was no structural need and little actual opportunity for other leadership to
emerge from within the city. When the commission’s term expired in 1995, the Mogan
Center’s community exhibits and other special programming were left without fund-
ing and without an institutionalised local presence to sustain them. Shortly before my
fieldwork began, national park management had responded to public concern about
the  resulting  lack  of  a  local  voice  in  the  park’s  productions  by  appointing  a  new
advisory committee for the Mogan Center, comprising three public historians from the
park,  three  representatives  from  the  university,  and  three  ‘at-large’  community
members. Along with a half-time coordinator hired by the park to oversee the centre,
this group was charged with reanimating the Mogan Center and helping it to achieve
its  original  goal  of  becoming  a  lively  and  inclusive  community  space—a  goal  now
somewhat complicated by the arrival of many sizeable new immigrant groups in the
city  in  the  years  since  the  founding  of  the  park.  Park  managers  were  particularly
concerned  about  making  connections  to  these  new  groups.  The  recent  immigrants
represented not only an extension of the park’s interpretive narrative about immigra-
tion, a changing labour force, and ethnicity, but also an important future constituency
in the city and a reflection of wider demographic changes in the USA as a whole—an
issue of some importance for a federal agency whose funding base is potentially affected
by  the  good  will  or  indifference  of  local  and  national  electorates.  The  community
representatives on the committee were clearly selected with this goal in mind. All were
people of colour and/or associated in some way with the city’s newer ethnic communi-
ties, while the park and university representatives were white and not marked as ethnic
except in the case of one man who was from Lowell’s long-assimilated French Cana-
dian community. At the same time, the community members were drawn from the
same educated professional classes as the park and university representatives, and were
associated with the same tightly integrated network of organisations and institutions
that had long been active in historic preservation and cultural production in the city.
While attempting to forge new relationships across ethnic lines, then, the national park
managers who selected the advisory committee continued to evade the realities of class
and  socio-economic  difference  underlying  their  separation  from  the  city’s  recent
immigrant populations.

Park managers and the new Mogan Cultural Center Community Committee alike
wanted to make an immediate and striking statement about the centre’s revitalisation.4
The committee proposed to host a professionally produced re-inaugural exhibition for

420 C. Stanton

which it budgeted $15,000. According to the call for proposals, the chosen theme, ‘The
People of Lowell: Past and Present’, was intended to produce an exhibit that would
‘reflect  the  city’s  social  mosaic  in  a  way  that  contributes  to  positive  cross-cultural
exchanges among residents’ and ‘present the personality of the city and its people in a
creative way’. Because of time constraints, potential exhibitors had just over a month
to respond, resulting in a very small pool of proposals. Most of these were from people
already closely affiliated with the Lowell heritage realm, who were proposing to make
considerable use of previously exhibited material. Only one, from a pair of Boston-area
folklorists who had done contract work on various folk-life projects in Lowell, met the
committee’s key criterion of promoting cross-cultural exchange. This project, ‘Feasting
on  Lowell’,  used  food  as  a  starting  point  for  talking  about  the  city’s  people.  The
folklorists planned to include an exhibit on the city’s ethnic food markets, a small-scale
academic  conference,  and  a  series  of  ‘foodways  performances’,  essentially  cookery
demonstrations  with  cultural  commentary,  by  people  from  Lowell’s  various  ethnic
communities.

The advisory committee was divided over the merits of this proposal. Some commit-
tee members expressed concern over the lack of new research or material and the fact
that the presenters were from outside the city and could not, therefore, speak authori-
tatively about local identity. One member, in particular, objected to the linkage of food
with ethnicity, which he saw as ‘domesticating’ immigrants and other local people in a
stereotypical and somewhat demeaning way. Others, including the public historians
from the park, supported the folklorists’ contention that the subject of food could be a
useful lens for looking at inter-cultural relationships and the construction of ethnic
identities, something they hoped the proposed conference might address. Supporters
of the ‘foodways’ project also noted that it was the only proposal with an element of
social exchange and encounter, as opposed to more conventional displays of wall text
and images. With the clock ticking and a planned re-inaugural open house not far away,
the committee quickly debated its options. The dominant voices in this discussion were
those of the park and university representatives on the committee. The community
representatives were much less vocal; in fact, they were much less often present at the
meetings, which were held during regular working hours and so posed a difficulty for
members whose employers were not part of the close circle of heritage institutions that
included the national park and the university. It was clear from my observations of these
meetings  that  an  overriding  concern  for  the  dominant  members  was  to  avoid  open
clashes within the committee itself. Although there were strong feelings for and against
the  ‘foodways’  proposal,  no  one  seemed  willing  to  take  a  definite  stance  if  it  might
provoke a confrontation. Instead, through a series of small compromises, the proposal
was whittled down before finally being accepted. The display of previously exhibited
materials was dropped, as was the conference idea. What was left was a series of three
small-scale food demonstrations, the first of which was scheduled to take place at the
May 2002 re-inaugural open house.

This first Feasting on Lowell element took place at the end of a morning of commu-
nity activities at the Mogan Center (see Figure 2). In front of an audience of about 20
people, a Cambodian woman and a younger Laotian-American woman demonstrated

salad-making  techniques.  A  Cambodian-American  man  who  frequently  acted  as  a
liaison  between  Cambodians  and  Euro-Americans  in  Lowell  translated  for  the
Cambodian woman, who did not speak English fluently, while the folklorists provided
occasional comments and served as hosts, displaying the completed dishes and urging
the  audience  to  sample  them.  Questions  from  the  audience  were  undemanding—
‘Why do you boil the chicken instead of roasting it?’—and were more often answered
by the folklorists than the performers themselves. The atmosphere was friendly and
casual, but the Southeast Asians remained on one side of the table, the mostly Western
attendees  on  the  other.  The  audience  was  somewhat  more  culturally  diverse  than
others at national park events, largely because it included some invited guests from
various cultural groups in the city, but it was still heavily weighted towards national
park employees and familiar faces from the city’s network of heritage organisations. It
was a pleasant enough gathering, and most of us who attended it enjoyed tasting the
Southeast Asian salads and socialising casually with people we knew. But when viewed
in a more critical light, it was clear that the ‘foodways’ performance did nothing to
challenge the feel-good aura of multiculturalism that imbues many heritage produc-
tions, including many in Lowell. Instead, the event reproduced a troubling and all-
too-familiar pattern of colourful ethnic ‘others’ performing their culture for the gaze
of  people  of  European  descent.  This  unproblematic  exoticism  might  have  been
countered either by the aborted academic conference or by more vigorous discussion
within the committee—for instance, in the form of a stronger stance by the advisory
committee member who had argued against the clichéd linking of ethnicity and food.

422 C. Stanton

But both these elements had been lost in the series of compromises that produced the
programme. There now follows an analysis of the forces that shaped those compro-
mises, and the various frustrations and dissatisfactions that resulted among organisers
and performers alike.

Analysis

On the surface, the social and discursive dynamics operating in the Feasting on Lowell
event seemed relatively straightforward: a group of professional outsiders (the public
historians at the national park and the non-local folklorists) and people from dominant
local groups had collaborated to create an event that placed subordinate ‘others’ on
display while effectively excluding them from decision-making roles in the production.
The Southeast Asian cooks were placed in a position of what Dean MacCannell has
termed ‘forced traditionalism’,5 performing their culture in a way that would not have
been required of the folklorists, the public historians, or the local cultural activists. The
analysis  of  such  social  and  cultural  disparities  forms  the  backbone  of  much  of  the
anthropological  study  of  heritage  and  tourism.6  Indeed,  MacCannell  has  famously
argued that ‘sightseeing is a ritual performed to the differentiations of society’,7 and that
tourism itself is both a producer and a characteristic product of those differentiations.
In its broad outline, then, the Feasting on Lowell event would seem to fit into the
model of dominant versus subordinate social groups and discourses of traditionalism
versus modernity. This interpretation could unfold along those now-familiar lines, as
a critique of hegemonic heritage practices that reproduce social inequalities and leave
limited room for ‘others’ to determine the representational agenda. But my focus on
the part played by public historians in this event and my concern with a possible role
for scholarly inquiry within such cultural productions lead me to choose a somewhat
different approach. As Peggy Sanday has argued: 

While asymmetry may be universal, the lines that divide people into unequal classes
are not. Most interesting for social change is an analysis of how particular asymmetries
arise in specific historical contexts and social arenas. The public-interest arm of such
research involves making this knowledge easily accessible first to interested publics
and secondly to the discursive arena of public-interest debate.8

In order to explore the lines of inequality operating on this particular occasion, my
starting point is the singular lack of enthusiasm on the part of all the participants and
producers about the May 2002 presentation, and their shared desire—communicated
in interviews and conversations—to see more egalitarian kinds of cultural exchange
taking place in the Mogan Cultural Center and in the city as a whole. From there, I move
to the question of why the food demonstration developed as it did despite this apparent
openness to a rethinking of the kinds of outmoded patterns reproduced in the event.
Several  potentially  critical  perspectives  were  operating  within  the  selection  and
performance processes described above. First, the entrenched local voice, represented
by the long-established cultural activists who occupied two of the three university seats
on  the  advisory  committee,  tended  to  resist  the  representational  authority  of  non-
locals and to insist that cultural productions in Lowell, especially those dealing with the

International Journal of Heritage Studies

423

contemporary  city,  should  be  meaningful  and  accountable  to  people  from  the  city
itself. One of these people had worked as the director of cultural affairs for the Lowell
Historic Preservation Commission more than a decade earlier. During the creation of
the  Working  People  exhibit  in  the  Mogan  Center,  he  had  successfully  blocked  a
proposal  by  the  exhibition  design  team  to  depict  a  19th-century  Lowell  immigrant
family seated around a kitchen table discussing labour and political issues, in part on
the grounds that such portrayals marginalised immigrants instead of showing them as
active players in the city’s political, social, and economic life. He raised concerns about
this same clichéd linkage of food and ethnicity during discussions about the Mogan
Center re-inaugural programme, although his objections were voiced less vigorously
than they had been in the earlier case, for reasons discussed below.

The second set of potentially critical voices came from the heritage practitioners—
the  public  historians  and  public  folklorists—whose  training  and  politics  generally
prompted them to argue that cultural productions should include acts of contextuali-
sation and linkages to broader and often critical patterns of interpretation. The folklor-
ists specifically countered the fact of their outsider status by noting, as one of them did
in an interview, that ‘there is a purpose to be served by this anthropological role. There
are things that we can do as outsiders, that we can see as outsiders, that we can kind of
oversee, that you can’t do when you’re on the inside’—for example, to provide a critical
or comparative perspective that could have value for everyone involved. However, the
Mogan  Center  event  as  it  eventually  developed  was  frustrating  to  them  because  it
offered  no  opportunities  to  build  long-term  relationships  across  class  and  cultural
lines, and because their position as outside contractors gave them no platform from
which to create anything more lasting. As one put it: 

It would be nice if … we were asked to do a little more, kind of … participate to help
develop this stuff and not just be an adjunct. I feel a little like a stewardess. I would like
to be a co-pilot rather than a stewardess. But I also want to be paid if I’m going to be
a co-pilot. I don’t want to be paid as if I’m a stewardess.

Finally, the Southeast Asian performers had at least some ability to challenge and
provide alternatives to the dominant patterns of heritage display as they played out in
the ‘foodways’ demonstration. This potential operated in a very minor way, but it was
perceptible  nonetheless.  As  Richard  Bauman  and  Patricia  Sawin  demonstrate  for
participants in the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife, the Feasting on Lowell
performers were: 

agents, reflexive, adaptive, and critical, crafting the representations in which they are
involved, working to figure out what they should and could be doing within a folklife
[production], negotiating their way through structures of power and authority, and
offering firm, if usually good-humored, resistance when they feel that their own sense
of identity and self-worth is impinged upon by others.9

At the Lowell event, the Cambodian translator gently lampooned the authority of the
National Park Service by borrowing a park ranger’s hat and using it as an element of
his  teasing  portrayal  of  a  television  cooking  show  host  (‘I  can  cook!  Everybody  can
cook!’). An adept and committed community activist, the translator also saw the event

424 C. Stanton

as  an  opportunity  to  bring  into  public  heritage  space  at  least  one  person—the
Cambodian  cook—who  had  not  hitherto  had  any  public  presence  within  the  city’s
heritage  productions.  The  cook  agreed  that  this  was  a  positive  experience  for  her,
noting that she was particularly pleased that her grandchildren had been able to see her
speaking  and  demonstrating  her  knowledge  in  public,  since  it  portrayed  her  as  a
person with worthwhile knowledge to share and also showed that Cambodian culture
was  of  interest  to  dominant  social  groups  in  the  city.  While  she  was  somewhat
bemused at the considerable attention paid to what was to her a very ordinary chicken
salad,  she  seemed  willing  to  mobilise  a  certain  amount  of  strategic  essentialism,  a
depiction of inherited Cambodian tradition, in order to make a statement about the
importance  of  Cambodians  within  contemporary  Lowell.  On  the  other  hand,  the
translator told me he thought this kind of event ‘could be more diversified and more
often,  not  just  a  one-way  thing,  you  know’.  When  I  noted  that  it  was  usually  only
ethnic others, not members of the dominant culture, who were expected to perform
their culture in ways framed as folkloric or traditional, he quickly agreed that includ-
ing an American woman in the salad-making demonstration would have produced a
very different kind of event: 

And then the Cambodians can learn, too. Like a lot of Cambodians don’t learn about
American cooking, because they … take their kids to McDonald’s and Burger King,
but the real American cooking, they can learn, you know. Because there’s healthy ways
of eating, you know, you can learn about diet, you can learn about nutrition … So I
think learning shouldn’t be like just one way. Whenever you do creative programs you
should think of ways you can teach the other and the other teaches you …

[Do you see things like that happening now around Lowell?]

Not really. I don’t see a lot happening among Hispanics and Asians, among whites and
Hispanics and Asians. I don’t see a lot of getting together in that way. I think people
still live in their own ethnic enclaves and there isn’t much going on. But we need to do
more.

Like the translator, the other cultural producers involved in this and other events in
Lowell  articulated  a  vision  of  their  work  as  ultimately  facilitating  a  healthier,  more
democratic and egalitarian society. As one of the folklorists put it, ‘It’s really impor-
tant to figure out how to do culture, class, sharing of not only raw power but concep-
tual power, cultural and conceptual power … That’s sort of what the whole point is:
everybody  not  only  sharing  but  evening  up  the  relationship.  And  …  I  guess  I  see
myself  standing  at  the  fulcrum.’  She  talked  about  the  idea  of  moving  her  freelance
career  from  the  Boston  area  to  Lowell  in  an  attempt  to  realise  this  vision:  ‘[T]hat
would  be  the  challenge.  Do  it  there.  Go  in  and  do  it.  If  you  can  do  it  there,  other
people could do it somewhere else. Whatever “it” is. I’m not sure what “it” is exactly,
but that would be part of the challenge.’ Another informant, a public historian hired
as an exhibition consultant by the national park, similarly felt that the time was ripe
for a breakthrough, or a return, to a more truly community-oriented and democratic
public history, although she shared the folklorist’s inability to precisely define what
form that might take: 

International Journal of Heritage Studies

I have to believe it is going to emerge, because it always seems to come around in a
cycle … Where it’s going to emerge from, I don’t know … There’s no model to follow,
federal or otherwise … Somebody needs to emerge as a voice, and I don’t know where
it’s going to come from right now.

The Mogan Center advisory committee member who had formerly been cultural affairs
director of the Historic Preservation Commission also articulated to me a persuasive
vision of how the city’s heritage project could foster a vigorous and inclusive community
culture: 

[I]f you end up with your history on a wall that’s a dead end, then this thing hasn’t
turned out the way it’s supposed to. It’s supposed to continually sort of regenerate …
because you want people to remember what happened here, absorb it, integrate it into
the way that they move through the world now.

For him, public history, art, and culture were about ‘not being alienated’ from one’s
surroundings, neighbours, and larger political and social contexts.

What  blocked  the  fuller  operation  of  the  various  critical  and  potentially  critical
perspectives in the creation of the Feasting on Lowell event and kept it from fulfilling
its producers’ and performers’ desires for a less hierarchical, more participatory mode
of cultural contact, representation, and exchange? My research suggests that the answer
lies  in  the  specific  construction  of  Lowell’s  heritage  sphere  over  the  past  30  years.
Within this tightly interconnected network of people and institutions, a clear balance
of  authority  has  been  worked  out  between  locals  and  outsiders.  The  city’s  heritage
revitalisation effort is in essence a local project that has been exceptionally successful in
enlisting  the  resources  of  outside  professionals  and  institutions  (such  as  the  US
National  Park  Service)  to  aid  in  the  transformation  of  an  industrial  city  to  a  post-
industrial  one.  But  Lowellians,  like  people  in  other  de-industrialised  places,  have
learned a hard lesson about allowing their future to be determined by those who may
not be permanently rooted in the city. For civic leaders who have not forgotten the
effects of the textile mills’ abandonment, the heritage project offers a means of avoiding
past mistakes. One local cultural activist, speaking of Patrick Mogan’s vision for the
city’s revitalisation, told me that: 

[O]ne of the lessons that I took from [Mogan] was the wisdom of trying to guide this
whole revival effort toward resources that are indigenous. And that’s why to me the
whole cultural sector has been so fascinating, and I believe, fruitful and potentially
more  fruitful.  Because  it’s  about  our  architecture,  our  geography,  our  history,  the
contemporary expression—things that somebody can’t move out of town. You know,
it’s investing in the things that can’t be taken away from you, or that somebody on their
own can’t decide to remove. And so I think there’s a lot of good thinking behind this.

Over the past three decades, authority within Lowell’s cultural sector has been carefully
apportioned  between  long-established  local  people,  newcomers  who  have  recently
settled  in  the  city,  and  professional  outsiders.  These  outsiders  include  most  of  the
public historians at the park, who do not live in the city itself but often commute from
a considerable distance. The city’s newcomers include not only the new professional
class of entrepreneurs, artists, and planners who have been attracted to Lowell in recent
years but also the city’s many new immigrants. Like the professionals, both of these

426 C. Stanton

types  of  newcomers  are  valued  for  what  they  can  bring  to  the  city’s  revitalisation
effort—managerial skills, political connections or a confirmation of Lowell’s ‘vibrant’
ethnic diversity and continuing immigrant history. At the same time, these people are
not granted truly local status by long-term locals until they have demonstrated a multi-
generational  loyalty  to  the  city.  Recent  immigrants  pose  a  particular  danger  in  this
respect. The inherent particularism and oppositionality of much ethnic discourse, the
socio-economic disparities that disrupt Lowell’s carefully crafted image of itself as a
prosperous  post-industrial  place,  and  the  complex  transnational  loyalties  of  many
migrants  all  constitute  possible  challenges  to  the  city’s  heritage  realm.  Thus  the
Cambodian cook’s focus on strengthening her own authority in her grandchildren’s
eyes  while  asserting  the  importance  of  Cambodians  within  Lowell  ran  somewhat
counter to the broader goals of park managers and the dominant representatives on the
Mogan Center committee, who were seeking to uphold an established and unifying
pan-ethnic  discourse  about  culture  and  community.  Similarly,  the  translator,  like
many of the younger and well-educated refugees in Lowell, felt strongly drawn to use
his skills to help rebuild his home country, to which he returned shortly after the 2002
‘foodways’  demonstration.  In  the  long  term,  his  differing  loyalties  made  him  unac-
countable to the Lowell heritage realm. This lack of accountability to a project so inti-
mately connected with the city’s recuperation makes those who act as gatekeepers for
the heritage realm reluctant to hand over their guardianship of it to new immigrants
who have not yet proved their loyalty to Lowell. This wariness, rather than any more
malign or chauvinistic impulses, lies behind the cautious selection of the Mogan Center
committee’s  at-large  representatives.  At  the  same  time,  the  local  cultural  activists  I
spoke with seemed aware that their own fierce loyalty in many ways worked against the
inclusion of new voices in the heritage project, and acknowledged that leadership of the
project needed to be broadened for both philosophical and pragmatic reasons. Their
question was how to ensure succession without losing what had been gained through
such concerted effort over many years.

While discursive authority in Lowell’s heritage sphere is carefully balanced among
long-time  locals,  newcomers,  and  outsiders,  the  creation  of  that  sphere  has  also
fostered the growth of a new class of cultural producers from all three categories. This
class of people includes professional and amateur public historians, educators, artists,
planners, performers and producers of many types who form a close-knit group in this
small city. A local man active in this group for many years confirmed that ‘There’s a
kind of an activist tribe that know each other and seem to show up again and again and
again.’ Within this tribe, long-standing personal and professional relationships have
developed  over  many  years  within  an  unusually  well-funded  and  cohesive  heritage-
based redevelopment project. These relationships tend to produce collaboration and
cooperation rather than conflict, and serve, along with the balance of power between
insiders and outsiders, to explain the striking lack of open dissent among the dominant
voices on the Mogan Center advisory committee. Because the folklorists themselves
were a part of this network of cultural producers, they were less willing than they might
otherwise have been to express vocal opposition to the changes and compromises that
produced the watered-down ‘foodways’ presentation.

An ethnographic analysis, then, reveals the many layers of negotiation, relationship,
and investment beneath the surface of this apparently unexceptional event. Cultural
performance  theory  is  helpful  in  examining  these  subtle  currents  and  showing  how
they  relate  to  much  larger  forces  and  events.  Although  a  good  deal  of  the  cultural
performance literature, like the literature on tourism, has tended to focus on sharply
unequal  and  oppositional  relationships  between  dominant  and  subordinate  (often
indigenous) groups, this body of theory also recognises that cultural performance is
sometimes  about  maintenance  rather  than  change,  and  that  there  may  be  as  much
social activity going on in a seemingly static performance as in a dramatic or confron-
tational one. In Victor Turner’s words: 

Even when … conflict may appear to be muted or deflected or rendered as a playful
or joyous struggle, it is not hard to detect threads of connection between elements of
the  play  and  sources  of  conflict  in  sociocultural  milieus.  The  very  mufflings  and
evasions  of  scenes  of  discord  in  some  theatrical  and  natural  traditions  speak
eloquently  to  their  real  presence  in  society,  and  may  perhaps  be  regarded  as  a
cultural  defense-mechanism  against  conflict  rather  than  a  metacommentary  upon
it.10

Kirk Fuoss insists that all forms of cultural performance, in which we can include the
many forms of display connected with heritage, are by nature agonistic, and that the
task for the scholar examining them is to determine whether they maintain or subvert
status  quo  relations  of  power,  what  strategies  are  utilised  for  this  directional
movement, and in what arenas these strategies are employed.11 It is this type of analysis
that I have attempted above for the Feasting on Lowell event.

Following Fuoss’s model, I argue that this particular cultural performance worked
to maintain a set of existing relationships established during the late 1970s and 1980s
as  Lowell’s  heritage  revitalisation  plan  took  shape.  While  there  is  an  undeniable
component of aggressive economic redevelopment to this plan which shapes much of
what happens within the heritage sphere, the project is not monolithic and includes
many  social  and  cultural  activists,  like  some  of  the  public  historians  who  were  my
primary  focus,  who  sincerely  desire  to  use  their  work  in  counter-hegemonic  ways.
The fact that they were unable to do so in this case can be explained by the very high
degree of concern over succession and stewardship within the cultural sector of the
redevelopment project, along with the close and carefully balanced interrelationships
that  have  developed  among  the  knowledge  and  culture  workers  who  constitute
Lowell’s new class of cultural producers, plus a certain material anxiety on the part of
those who are dependent for a living on short-term public funding. Through a series
of administrative decisions (for example, the holding of meetings during the working
day,  which  limited  the  pool  of  potential  new  community  representation  on  the
Mogan  Center  advisory  committee)  and  discursive  choices  which  strategically
avoided  strong  expressions  of  dissent  or  opposition,  the  considerable  critical  and
participatory potential of the centre’s re-inaugural event was blunted, resulting in a
programme that pleased no one and reproduced hierarchical, traditionalising patterns
of  display  that  worked  against  the  committee’s  desired  goal  of  more  egalitarian
cultural contact.

Opportunities

The  key  question  remains—can  an  analysis  such  as  this  become  part  of  public
discourse in a way that might support the very similar goals of performers, producers,
and  scholarly  critics  alike?  How  might  anthropological  inquiry  have  opened  this
shared discontent and capitalised on the latent potential for positive social change? In
this  concluding  section  I  suggest  three  avenues  for  approaching  this  task  without
wholly  abandoning  the  scholar’s  traditional  emphasis  on  observation  rather  than
advocacy.

First, it is crucial that anthropologists and other academic heritage scholars raise their
voices in forums populated by the new class of professional practitioners who increas-
ingly populate the heritage field, not just in Western countries but around the globe.
The emergence of this new class of cultural producers offers useful opportunities for
dialogue across disciplinary boundaries and, more important, across the divide between
scholarship and practice. I regularly attend conferences of public historians, where I am
generally the only anthropologist present, but where my anthropologically informed
approach has often provoked lively and productive discussion and where I am stimu-
lated in turn by the opportunity to exchange views with those who are actively doing
the  things  I  am  studying.  Many  of  these  practitioners  already  speak  our  theoretical
languages and share some of our political concerns. In Lowell, in fact, my public histo-
rian informants often revealed themselves to be familiar with the scholarly literature I
was using to try to understand Lowell myself; in a few cases, they had even contributed
to that literature.12 To a large extent, it is the presence of increasing numbers of heritage
professionals that creates the porous boundary identified here as a key characteristic of
scholarly  study  of  heritage  productions  and  an  important  opportunity  for  greater
exchange between scholarship and public heritage practices. By engaging in this way
with informants who are also peers and in some sense colleagues, we by no means avoid
the kind of angry ‘native’ responses that Briggs has noted in the case of the ‘invention
of  tradition’  literature.  In  fact,  we  open  ourselves  more  fully  to  the  possibility  of
challenges on our own home turf, as Eric Gable and Richard Handler found when their
critical analysis of the work of social historians at Colonial Williamsburg13 provoked a
sharply worded response from the institution’s vice president for research, Cary Carson,
in  the  Journal  of  American  History.  However,  while  disagreeing  strongly  with  the
anthropologists’ overall framework, Carson also noted that some of their specific obser-
vations had prompted reflection at the institution, and predicted that the book resulting
from their research would ‘occupy an honored place on the reference shelf for years to
come’.14 Such an acknowledgement points to the activist potential inherent in studies
of heritage even when scholars do not move beyond their conventional role as research-
ers and writers. For anthropologists in particular, this exchange shows us the possibil-
ities for inquiries that move beyond the socio-economic disparities between researcher
and informant that have historically characterised the discipline.

Claiming common discursive ground with heritage professionals, of course, by no
means  implies  that  critical  scholars  should  entirely  abandon  their  focus  on  the
subaltern, the marginalised, the silenced. In fact, our ability to provide a simultaneous

International Journal of Heritage Studies

429

dual focus—on those who are excluded or subordinated through heritage practices as
well as those who control those practices—may be one of the most important contri-
butions we can make to a public interest approach to heritage studies. This brings me
to my second suggestion for a more activist academic study of heritage. If we are able
to  enter  more  directly  into  the  discursive  fields  we  study  through  participation  in
conferences and other gatherings of heritage professionals, perhaps we can find ways to
go a step farther and locate—or create—settings (for example, conferences or commu-
nity projects) where we can encounter not only other scholars and professional heritage
practitioners  but  also,  crucially,  the  community  activist  groups  whose  voices  are  so
often mediated or not heard at heritage sites. By working to clarify underlying motiva-
tions and causes at the sites we study—for example, the anxiety about succession that
worked  against  the  inclusion  of  a  wider  range  of  community  representation  at  the
Mogan Cultural Center—we may be able to help reframe conversations among dispar-
ate groups and move discussions away from more surface issues. Such efforts could
prompt a re-envisioning so that all of us operating in these discursive fields can see
ourselves  as  people  working  to  create  a  community  of  representation  rather  than
simply a representation of community, as a narrower view of heritage practices would
have it.

Finally,  anthropologists  studying  heritage  should  be  bolder  about  doing  what  we
have  always  done  in  other  settings—talking  about  specific  social  characteristics  and
relationships and how they are linked with discursive practices and the workings of
power.  Barbara  Kirshenblatt-Gimblett  has  proposed  that  academic  folklore  has  ‘an
important cooperative role’ to play in addressing the kinds of inequalities and exclu-
sions that public folklore projects, like the Feasting on Lowell presentation, all too often
mask. She calls on scholars to take ‘an ethnographic approach to the public sector …
and to the impact of particular projects and activities on those involved’.15 Thorough
ethnographic studies of heritage sites are becoming more common, but scholars still
seem reluctant to probe into the class and cultural positioning of our peer informants.
As a result, we have almost no empirically grounded studies of professional heritage
practitioners  operating  as  social  actors  within  a  broad  cultural  context.  Richard
Maddox has argued that this kind of imbalance: 

inevitably skews our understanding of the contemporary world because it makes it
difficult, if not impossible, to trace and analyse the linkages between what is going on
in places near the top and centres of the global pecking order and what is happening
in sites near the bottom and on the margins.16

By  articulating  our  findings  about  social  relationships  and  characteristics,  not  just
discursive  practices,  and  by  doing  so  in  arenas  populated  by  our  informants  them-
selves, we may be able to hold a mirror up to the heritage field that can contribute to
the reframing called for above.

My own proudest achievement in this effort came at a conference of the National
Council  on  Public  History  in  the  spring  of  2003,  when  I  presented  a  demographic
study of public historians in Lowell that focused on their socio-economic positioning
and its relationship to the history presented at the national park. I made use of some

430 C. Stanton

autobiographical material in a recent book on Lowell by folklorist Martha Norkunas,
who was in the room. When the panel presentations were finished, she said: ‘I’ve never
been studied before. It’s a funny feeling!’ In that moment, I knew I had done some-
thing  to  realign  the  politics  of  representation,  something  that  might  contribute
towards  an  eventual  levelling  of  the  ground  between  the  credentialed  scholars  and
gatekeepers in the conference hotel room and the two Southeast Asian women who
had been cutting up vegetables and mixing fish sauce for an audience in Lowell a year
before.

Notes

1 [1] Briggs, ‘Metadiscursive Practices’. Anthropology, with its disciplinary focus on social dynamics
and  its  recent  spasm  of  self-criticism  about  the  relationships  of  ethnographers  to  their
informants, offers unique advantages for understanding these social arenas, and I draw prima-
rily  on  anthropological  literature  in  this  article.  However,  the  issues  under  discussion  are
germane to any of the disciplines involved in the heritage field, from history and folklore to
architectural preservation and urban planning.
