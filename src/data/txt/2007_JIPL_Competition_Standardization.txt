The interplay between IP rights and competition
law in the context of standardization
Piotr Staniszewski*

People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for
merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a
conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to
raise prices

Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations

The interplay between IP and competition law has been
present in legal debate and case law for many years. In
European Community law, the crucial issues continue
to revolve around the content of licensing agreements1
and refusal to license in the context of abuse of a
dominant position. In cases such as Volvo v Erik Veng,2
Magill,3 IMS Health,4 and more recently Microsoft,5 the
European Commission and the European Court of
Justice sought to limit the scope of exercise of IP rights
in order to create ‘a system ensuring that competition
in the internal market is not distorted’.6 However, the
result of those attempts was the doctrine of ‘exceptional
circumstances’7 whereby only in special circumstances
could competition law intervene against IP rights.

A theoretical obstacle and the source of controversy
between IP and competition lawyers is the monopol-
ization inherent in IP rights. By their nature, IP rights
are intended to confer monopoly power to the holder.
Therefore, respecting this principle, it is accepted that
competition law might generally intervene only at a
subsequent stage of exercise of those monopoly rights.

There may be, however, an important exception to
this rule. Case law and doctrine may have to tackle a
question of abuse different to abuse of monopoly power
resulting from a patent itself. Its source lies in deceitful
behaviour intended to enhance the holder’s chances of
achieving a patent-based monopoly position over sig-
niﬁcant parts of markets through the actions of stan-
dard-setting organizations—bodies of great importance
in the global economy. The role of such standard-setting

helps achieve interoperability and transparency, allowing
penetration into multiple markets.

of standards cannot be underestimated; nor should the
measures be taken deceitfully to inﬂuence the standard-
ization process and the need to devise appropriate
countermeasures such as IP right disclosure or pre-
agreed RAND licensing.

to neutralize the threat of misuse and deceit, is also
important in terms of patent law. Disclosure of IP rights
entails a risk that a competitor, once informed of the
invention, may seek to use such information in order to
obtain patents for improvements which the applicant
might itself have invented, had the information been
kept conﬁdential.9

Patent law, however, contains measures which may
help to limit the effects of abuse. For instance, IP en-
forcement may be inhibited in the light of circumstances
attributable to the party seeking to enforce his rights:
the common law ‘doctrine of clean hands’10 prohibits
beneﬁting from gains from patents obtained unlawfully.
Therefore, IP law has, in certain situations,11 a response
to these problems.

This article seeks to describe the question of deceit-
ful inﬂuence over the standardization process (‘patent
ambush’) from a competition law perspective, also
exploring some current solutions that may be applied
to it.

Standardization in the context
of competition law
Character of standardization
In recent years, standardization has become increas-
ingly important. Through compatibility standards, the
products and services of different manufacturers and
providers are able to communicate and interact in
the network environment.12 Standards also allow the
global sale of identical products by reducing the trans-
action costs of adjusting goods to differing national or
regional norms, also providing information upon
which consumers can compare the quality and safety
of products and their intended use.13

Despite apparent production beneﬁts, successful stan-
dardization may disadvantage consumers by reducing
the incentive to innovate and increasing switching
costs.14 Those problems may be balanced by the beneﬁts
which
increased

standardization

through

brings

transparency of the market, facilitating easier compari-
son of products, and product systems.15 Secondly, con-
sumers may also beneﬁt from increased interoperability
within product systems and between systems using
different but compatible standards. Finally, standardiz-
ation may promote use of a technology which brings
additional beneﬁts (for instance by introducing a low-
emission fuel standard which promotes a clean environ-
ment).

From the economic point of view, three processes of
standardization may be identiﬁed: non-co-operative beha-
viour, co-operative behaviour, and government action.16
With non-co-operative behaviour, competitors offer pro-
ducts representing different standards, the choice between
them being made by the market (for instance competition
for a home video standard between VHS and Beta). Many
standards in computer software derive from programs
produced and marketed by software companies winning a
position of a de facto standard. In a market characterized
by ‘network effects’, a network gains help to create a
‘snowball effect’ which accelerates the process of standard-
ization. In certain markets, increased popularity of the
primary product (for instance a PC operating system or
GSM mobile phone) fosters creation of a secondary
market (for system applications or mobile phone ring
tones, wallpaper, etc.). Lastly, standardization is evident in
intrabrand competition, as distributors compete for sales
of the primary (and secondary) products. Consequently,
the manufacturer of the product which inspired creation
of the de facto standard will enjoy a strong position on the
market, possibly even a position of market power or dom-
inance. A side effect of this strong position will inﬂuence
competition in secondary or neighbouring markets.

While non-co-operative behaviour

is an ad hoc
process, the other two methods are centralized and
take place through standard-setting organizations. In co-
operative behaviour, market participants come together
and develop standards through committees, voting on
proposals based on their discussions (examples include
the TCP/IP protocol).17 This form of standardization is

This argument was raised by Rambus in proceedings before the FTC
(discussed below).

(N.D. Ill. 1997).

11 US patent case law also denies patent protection in the event of deceitful
manipulation of the standardization process, examples include: Stambler
v Diebold, 878 F.2d 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1989); Wang Laboratories, Inc. v
Mitsubishi Electronics America, Inc., 103 F.3d 1571, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

Standards relating to Internet were and are developed through a private
body—the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and in separation
from ofﬁcial (public-sponsored) standardization organizations. Many of
commonly used standards are ﬁrst developed by independent SSOs and
only subsequently accepted by IETF, for instance: WWW (established by
W3 Consortium) or VoIP (established by VoIP Forum). IETF established
ﬁrst links with public-sponsored standardization organizations only in
2001.

essentially private and involves participants who regu-
larly compete with each other, a feature which necessarily
gives it great importance under competition law. Under
the third method, a government authority mandates
drafting, adoption, or use of certain standards (for
example those of the International Organization for
Standardization).
International government-sponsored
standardization authorities may also develop standards,
as was the case of the NMT18 standard developed by
Nordic Teleconference, an international forum of Scandi-
navian postal and telecom regulators. Later, the GSM19
standard was developed through international co-oper-
ation initiated within the Confe´rence Europe´enne des
Postes et Te´le´communications (CEPT).

Regardless of the background of a given standard-
setting organization, in both private and public forms
the representatives of market players inﬂuence the stan-
dardization process considerably and constitute its
essential parties. They ultimately determine where
product manufacture in accordance with the standard
lies and bear the economic risks involved. They are also
the parties with the best technological know-how and
knowledge of its practical application.

Both in co-operative behaviour and government-
sponsored process, two types of procedure are available:
open and closed. Closed process involves a limited
number of participants (usually lower than the total
number of market players). Participation in an open
process is available to parties meeting predeﬁned cri-
teria; not necessarily industry members but also other
constituencies. The open standardization process gener-
ally raises fewer competition law concerns, given its
transparency and deﬁned rules of participation.

The role of standard-setting organizations
Standard-setting organizations establish a forum for
the collective adoption of standards. Through stan-
dard-setting organizations, producers of different goods
and services who are interested in technological inter-
dependence may co-ordinate speciﬁcations with one
another on a global or regional scale.

In the USA,

the most common standard-setting
device is the private model.20 Public-sponsored standard-

setting organizations are less popular but also play an
important
role. Most often, government-sponsored
standard-setting organizations will be formed ad hoc to
develop a standard for a particular need.

In the European Union, the most important stan-
dard-setting organizations operate under the European
Standards Organization Directive 98/34.21 The main
role in standardization is currently played by the three
ofﬁcial (public-sponsored) organizations:22 the Euro-
pean Telecoms Standardisation Institute (ETSI),
the
European Committee for Standardization (CEN), and
the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standard-
ization (CENELEC). All three are essentially public but
also include wide representation from the industries
concerned. Apart from these three, government-spon-
sored standard-setting organizations exist throughout
the European Union member states.

In the EU context, since the birth of

the ‘New
Approach’ towards harmonization in 1980s,23 standards
serve as the medium for integration of the common
market, ensuring smooth application of the free move-
ment of goods principles of the Treaty establishing the
European Community.

Regardless of the work conducted within ETSI, CEN,
and CENELEC and national bodies, private standard-
setting organizations also play an important role.24
Typically European private organizations are formed
initially to develop common standards for the European
market in order to defend incumbent producers from
Asian or US-based competition. These private European
standardization forums are subsequently extended to
include Asian and American manufacturers.

Setting up standard-setting organizations
Standard-setting organizations usually exist in one of
three basic forms. First, they may constitute an ad hoc
meeting of enterprises interested in jointly creating and
marketing a technology standard.25 In many instances,
such ad hoc standard-setting organizations will be
formed as joint ventures to license the common stan-
dard to other market participants to beneﬁt the share-
holders who established it. The ad hoc form is less
interested in extracting royalties from contributed IP

In the European Commission Guidelines on the applicability of Art 81

rights, than in successfully marketing products which
incorporate the standard. There are fewer problems of
patent ambush and reasonable and non-discriminatory
(RAND) licence terms in activities of this type.

The second form is a government-sponsored (public)
permanent
standard-setting organization. These are
more complex forms, anchored in legislation and com-
bining different constituencies which together draft stan-
dards which are endorsed by public authority.26

The third group, most prevalent in the USA, are
private permanent standard-setting organizations, such
as JEDEC or VESA. Like the previous example, they
gather participants of different degrees of inﬂuence on
the market. The attractiveness of the standard adopted

Functioning of a standard-setting organization
Generally, standard-setting organizations serve a useful
function and do not draw the attention of national
competition authorities. Their common goal
to
adopt and promote a standard which does not involve
anyone’s IP or, where they do involve such proprietary
information, to ensure that the IP right holder licenses
his rights on RAND terms.27 Consequently, IP rights
held by participants of a standard-setting organization
which cover the standard being drafted should be ade-
quately disclosed to fellow members, thus helping to
limit possible undue beneﬁts conferred on IP rights
holders.

is

The questions of adequate disclosure and establish-
ment of RAND terms should be addressed in a stan-
dard-setting organization’s regulations.28 Observance of
those rules is crucial for the existence and operations
of standard-setting organizations as in their absence,
market participants’ incentives to join standard-setting
organizations are reduced.

From the participants’ perspective, extensive disclos-
ure regulations may not always be welcome. Partici-
pants, who usually hold a full portfolio of patents and
applications, may try to limit disclosure in order to

their

competitive position vis-a`-vis other
protect
market participants. Further, too extensive an exchange
of information may lead to allegations of entertaining
concerted practices. Again, the participants may seek
undue advantage from the exchange of
information

Standard-setting organizations
and competition law
Despite many

primary vehicles—standard-setting organizations—may

(i) standard-setting organizations may serve as a

forum for illegal collusion;

(ii) participants may illegally exclude other market

members from participation;29

(iii) participants may exclude other market members
from access to information required to employ
the standard.30

The exchange of information, which forms an essential
part of standard-setting organizations’ activities, may
itself give rise to competition law concerns where they
may enable or facilitate collusion (whether by agree-
ment or indirectly as concerted practices),31 such as
information about prices and costs of production.32
Limited numbers of market participants only amplify
concerns of possible anticompetitive behaviour,
the
probability of reaching a tacit agreement over prices or
market
in oligopolistic
markets. Thus, any co-operation between oligopoly
participants in standard-setting organizations should
be treated delicately.

Exchanges of information may also have other con-
sequences if an illegal cartel is discovered. Since it is
harder to cheat on a cartel once it is in operation and
the exchange of information takes place through a sep-
arate entity (such as the standard-setting organization),
those organizations may actually prolong cartels by
reducing opportunities for break-up.33 Institutionalized

Standard-setting

agreements
reached within the organization, as well as information
exchange, may also be analysed as ‘facilitating prac-
tices’,34 these being the contents of ancillary agreements
which may be challenged together with anticompetitive
conduct because of their ability to ‘pave the way’ for
infringements of competition law.35 In this context, the
US and European Union enforcement authorities have
focused on inﬂuencing the rules of the standardization
process36 in order to prevent its abuse and consequent
breach of competition law. Successful prevention limits
the possibilities of employing facilitating practices
through standard-setting organizations.

Whether or not they serve as co-operation forums to
facilitate illegal collusion,
standard-setting organiz-
ations may also face allegations of other violations of
competition law, such as illegal boycotts. In Rambus
(discussed below), the judge warned that ‘refusing to
include patented technology in industry standards may
subject
to antitrust
claims and denies consumers superior products’.37 The
danger of a group boycott is apparent when standard-
setting organizations promote a policy of
simply
refraining from including proprietary solutions in the
developed standards.38

standard setting organizations

Patent ambush
‘Patent ambush’ occurs when participants refrain from
disclosing patents and/or applications connected with
the standards drafted by a standard-setting body. It
may also be committed by gathering information
during committee meetings regarding future standards
being developed, then later ﬁling or amending patent
applications based on this information.

Once the undisclosed patent is inserted into the
standard or an application is amended to reﬂect the
stipulated solutions, the participant usually waits until

the standard gains popular recognition in the market.
This brings the effect of increased switching costs and
the ‘locking in’ of competitors and other manufacturers
into that standard.39 Only then will the participant
disclose the patent included in the standard, claiming
royalties and/or licence fees. At this point, the partici-
pant will already have certain market power conferred
by the IP rights in question, possibly augmented by
lack of competitive or alternative technologies. For the
ambushing member it is clear that any patent essential
for implementation of the standard will have a higher
value following adoption of the standard than it would
have if disclosed during the standardization process.40
The patent is essential when it is not possible to invent
around the technical solution while maintaining the
characteristics of the standard (eg operability and inter-
connectivity).

Not all standard-setting organizations require full
disclosure of patents and applications held or ﬁled by
its participants. The US standard-setting body JEDEC41
updated its relevant regulations towards extensive dis-
closure in 1993;42 ETSI did so only after intervention
of the European Commission in 2005.

United States antitrust law
Section 2 of the Sherman Act addresses unilateral anti-
competitive behaviour of market participants by pro-
hibiting actual or attempted monopolization. Monopoly
power is held to exist if a company holds a market share
of 80 or 90 per cent.43 However, the courts may accept
lower market shares—or even no proof of market share
at all—provided negative effects on the market are
proven. On the contrary, evidencing easy entry on the
market may help rebut the presumptions connected
with market thresholds.44

In the US market, power may be deﬁned as the
‘power to control prices or exclude competition’.45 Its
components are both the market share held by an
undertaking and the inﬂuence it may exert over prices,
output, and/or innovation.

Piotr Staniszewski . The interplay between IP rights and competition law

ARTICLE

671

Unlawful monopolization requires market power
and exclusionary or anti-competitive conduct.46 Gener-
ally, conduct is exclusionary when it serves no legiti-
mate purpose or does not bring proﬁt and was
undertaken with the sole purpose of excluding or
weakening competitors in anticipation of recouping
future supra-competitive proﬁts.47

Monopolization involves conduct capable of further
creating, maintaining, and expanding market power by
reducing the opportunities of competitors.48 Such
conduct should not bring beneﬁts for consumers, or
must be unnecessary to bring such beneﬁts. If the rel-
evant conduct does bring beneﬁts, these should be pro-
portionate to harm inﬂicted.

Monopolization involves conduct capable
of further creating, maintaining, and expanding
market power by reducing the opportunities
of competitors

Where exclusionary conduct is deﬁned by reference
to antitrust duties and standards, the legal standard for
a monopolization claim is whether this conduct vio-
lates pre-existing antitrust standards.49 The FTC high-
lighted that

[e]xclusionary conduct such as deception may distort the
selection of technologies and evade protections designed
by [standard-setting organizations] to constrain the exer-
cise of monopoly power, with substantial and lasting harm
to competition.50

The courts apply a rule of reason which may serve as a
defence for a company accused of anti-competitive
conduct. For this rule to apply, the company must
argue successfully a pro-competitive justiﬁcation of its
conduct in that it competes on the merits, its conduct
bringing efﬁciencies.

Causation between the alleged exclusionary conduct
and the maintenance or attainment of market power
must also be proved. The extent to which this causal
link may be inferred or assumed from alleged anticom-
petitive conduct is debatable.

In the context of misrepresentations during the
process, directed at the standard-setting organizations
in general and patent ambushes in particular,

an antitrust plaintiff must establish that the [standard-
setting organization] would not have adopted the standard
in question but for the misrepresentation or omission ...
because the failure to disclose the existence of a patent to a
standard-setting organization will not affect the competi-
tive marketplace if the standard-setting organization would
have approved the standard even if it had known about
the patent.51

An attempt to monopolize is an offence where speciﬁc
intent52 to control prices or destroy competition is
proved.53

Beyond purely antitrust claims based on section 2 of
the Sherman Act, section 5 of the Federal Trade Com-
mission Act empowers the FTC to prevent the use of
‘unfair methods of competition in or affecting com-
merce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or
affecting commerce’.

Dell Inc.
In 1995, the ﬁrst US federal action for alleged unilateral
subversion of a standard-setting process and anticom-
petitive effect was taken against Dell. The alleged
infringement consisted of providing misleading infor-
mation to a standard-setting organization, then seeking
beneﬁts from undisclosed IP rights included in the
standard.

that,

This alleged infringement began with a written state-
ment of a representative of Dell made to the Video
Electronics Standards Association (VESA) during the
standard-drafting process
‘to the best of his
knowledge’, Dell had no patents for the proposed new
standard of VL-bus. Following dissemination of the
standard adopted, Dell threatened to claim royalties
from companies using it. FTC claimed that the Dell’s
conduct
‘unduly restricted competition and caused
anticompetitive harm’ by discouraging companies (in
particular VESA members against whom the threats
were directed) from using that standard. Consequently,
Dell’s conduct was capable of hindering industry accep-
tance of it.54

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2007, Vol. 2, No. 10

The FTC warned that if a standard-setting organiz-
ation ‘requires that its members disclose any of their
intellectual property that might relate to a standard
being proposed by the standard-setting organization –
at least to the extent that the member knows that it
owns the intellectual property – then the failure to
make such disclosure may trigger liability for unfair
competition under section 5 of the FTC Act’.55 The
FTC complaint did not, however, employ standard
antitrust rules, failing to deﬁne the relevant market, the
market share, causation, or intention.

The case was eventually settled by consent. Dell
dropped its patent infringement claims and agreed to
refrain from seeking royalties from companies using
patented technology.

Rambus Inc.
Rambus was involved in the design, licensing, and mar-
keting of high-speed chip-connection dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) to downstream manufac-
turers. DRAMs in their various modiﬁcations were and
are widely used in personal computers.

Rambus was a member of JEDEC, a standard-setting
organization concerned with adopting open standards
in the area of semiconductors. In the FTC’s interpret-
ation (as supported by JEDEC), JEDEC’s rules and pro-
cedures, imposed upon members the following duties:

(i) to disclose any patents or applications that the
technology

applicant believed ‘might’
being considered for inclusion in a standard;

involve

(ii) to identify the aspect of JEDEC’s work to which

such patents or patent applications related;

(iii) to state whether it would license the technology
royalty-free or on RAND terms, if the technology
covered by a member’s known patents or patent
applications was proposed for inclusion in a stan-
dard endorsed by JEDEC.

In 1999, when the JEDEC standard for the JC-42 Syn-
chronous DRAM was the most widespread standard
for computer use, Rambus claimed royalties for patents
on solutions included in JC-42.

Rambus Inc. v Inﬁneon
Also in 1999, private litigation of Rambus v Inﬁneon56
commenced for patents infringement. On the counter-

the ﬁrst

Inﬁneon,

instance court

found
claim of
Rambus liable under Virginia law for fraud and con-
structive fraud on the grounds that Rambus failed to
disclose to JEDEC patents claims that it had secretly
and intentionally drafted to cover proposed JEDEC
standards.57 This decision was reversed by the court of
appeals, which stated that the duty to disclose was not
communicated to JEDEC members in a manner which
would give rise to liability for fraud or constructive
fraud under Virginia law. However, the court stressed
the prominent role of the standard-setting organiz-
ation’s rules in deﬁning the scope of duties of disclos-
ure and licensing. Contrary to VESA rules applicable in
Dell, JEDEC did not require a written statement on
patent disclosure. On appeal to the Federal Circuit
court, however, Judge Payne admitted (albeit orally and
without
that Rambus
appeared with ‘unclean hands’.58 The case was settled
in 2005.

FTC v Rambus Inc.
Extending the scope of alleged infringements beyond
Dell,
in Rambus FTC accused Rambus not only of
unfair competition by subverting JEDEC’s standard-
setting process but also of actual or attempted monop-
olization in markets
for
design and manufacture of DRAMs.59 The FTC alleged
that Rambus intentionally failed to disclose to JEDEC
that it held patents and ﬁled applications covering
technology contemplated for inclusion in the standard,
thereby breaching the standard-setting organization’s
internal rules on disclosure, and the general obligation
of good faith dealing. Rambus’ representative to the
JEDEC’s meetings not only failed to disclose its IP
rights but also gathered information which was later
used to amend Rambus’ pending patent applications.

features

The FTC’s

initial decision was

rejected by the
Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ) McGuire, whose
reasoning revolved around the FTC’s failure to pin
infringements committed by Rambus to speciﬁc pro-
visions of antitrust law. He said:

Section 5 [of the FTC Act] has never been implemented to
impose a general duty on corporations that participate in
standard-setting organizations to comply with the rules of
the standard-setting organization, to disclose their patent
applications or to act in good faith toward their members.

justiﬁcation and the patent

Further, the complaint lacked ‘clear and unambiguous’
evidence of a duty to disclose, exceeding the mere
encouragement to disclose essential IP rights endorsed
by JEDEC. Regarding the monopolization claims, ALJ
McGuire found that Rambus had legitimate business
reasons to pursue its conduct in protecting the conﬁ-
dentiality of
to
amend its pending patent applications. However, the
business
amendment
defence were accepted only on the grounds that the
JEDEC rules on those subjects were unclear and the
scope of duties by which its members were bound was
difﬁcult to deﬁne. There was no evidence of intent to
mislead or deceive the JEDEC. Finally, the causation
element was lacking as FTC did not provide evidence
that ‘Rambus acquired monopoly power by virtue of
JEDEC’s standard setting and it failed to show that, but
for Rambus conduct, JEDEC (and the market) would
have chosen an alternative to Rambus’ technology’.

However, reversing the ALJ’s decision on appeal, the

FTC found that Rambus

engaged in exclusionary conduct that signiﬁcantly contrib-
uted to its acquisition of monopoly power. . .. By hiding
the potential that Rambus would be able to impose royalty
obligations of
its own choosing, and by silently using
JEDEC to assemble a patent portfolio to cover the . . .

in turn,

The FTC declined to delve into details of by-laws of
standard-setting organizations: in the absence of any
rules on disclosure, participants cannot be ‘free to lie’
or mislead the fellow members. By virtue of
the
decision, Rambus’
conduct was held to violate
both section 2 of the Sherman Act and section 5 of the
FTC Act.

On 2 February 2007, FTC issued a remedy decision,
ordering Rambus to cease lying to standard-setting
organizations accompanied by compulsory licensing at
a ﬁxed rate applying to SDRAM and DDR SDRAM
products incorporating Rambus patents.

Unocal
A case similar to Rambus and Dell, but involving a
government-sponsored standardization process con-
cerned Union Oil Company of California (Unocal), a
participant in the scheme for low-emission gasoline
drafted by a state agency—California Air Resources
Board (CARB). The company adjusted its patent claims
following discussions and manipulated the process
towards adoption of its proprietary technology.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2007, Vol. 2, No. 10

European Community competition law
Article 81 EC
Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty prohibits ‘agreements
between undertakings, decisions by associations of
undertakings and concerted practices which may affect
trade between Member States and which have as their
object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion
of competition within the common market’. For the
standardization process, two concerns are important:
(i) the standard-setting organizations may be con-
sidered as ‘associations of undertakings’63 and (ii) co-
operation between members of
the standard-setting
organizations may amount to a ‘concerted practice’.

Exceptionally, by virtue of Article 81(3), such agree-
ments (decisions of associations of undertakings or
concerted practices) escape the prohibition and, conse-
quently the nullity sanction of Article 81(2). To beneﬁt
from the exemption, the agreements must

contribute to improving the production or distribution of
goods or to promoting technical or economic progress,
while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting
beneﬁt

but must not

(a) impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions
which are not indispensable to the attainment of these
objectives;
(b) afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating
competition in respect of a substantial part of the products
in question.

The European Commission explained the application
of Article 81(3) criteria in its Guidelines.64 These
clarify that
standards adopted by standard-setting
organizations which apply unrestricted and transparent
participation criteria and ‘set no obligation to comply
with the standard or which are parts of a wider agree-
ment
to ensure compatibility of products, do not
restrict competition’.65 Generally, recognized standard-
ization bodies founded on non-discriminatory, open,
and transparent procedures remain outside the scope
of interest of the European Commission.

the market;

Standardization agreements are also accepted by the
European Commission if their activities reach a negli-
gible part of
they pool small and
medium-sized enterprises to standardize ‘access forms
or conditions to collective tenders’; or if they standar-
dize minor product characteristics and have no signiﬁ-
cant effect on factors of competition on the relevant
markets.66

if

Standardization agreements aimed at the exclusion
of actual or potential competitors will almost always
fall within the scope of Article 81(1), as will those
which grant their parties control over production and/
or innovation, thus restricting their ability to compete
on product characteristics and at the same time affect-
ing third parties (suppliers or purchasers of standar-
dized product).

While the Commission is generally positive about
the role the standardization agreements play in the
economy,
it remains concerned over restrictions of
competition included within them. The Guideline
imposes an obligation on the parties to ‘demonstrate
that any restrictions on the setting, use or access to the
standard provide economic beneﬁts’, while standards
cannot limit innovation and should be as technology-
neutral as possible.

From the enforcement perspective, in order to catch
a patent ambush under the prohibition of Article 81(1)
at least two undertakings must co-operate to conceal
the patent rights and assert their right following disse-
mination of the standard. Article 81(1) does not cover
unilateral conduct.

While theoretically possible,67 it is hard to impute
anticompetitive conduct under Article 81(1) to the
entire standard-setting organization because one of its
members fails to disclose a patent held or applied for,
which is included in the standard. The ﬁnal standardiz-
ation agreement will generally be void only if there is a
‘concurrence of wills’68 between the members of the
standard-setting organization. In the patent ambush
scenario,
the standard-setting organization members
are as surprised by the claim for royalties directed at
companies which incorporate this standard as are those

element required to catch an agreement under Article
81(1) may be very difﬁcult to prove, if not impossible.

82 will still be prohibited under unfair competition
legislation in EU Member States.

Moreover, if the effect of Article 81(1) was to apply
fully to standardization agreements tainted by patent
ambushes, leading thus to their nullity, this would have
a very disturbing effect on that industry and possibly
those industries adjacent to it.69

The application of Article 81 to patent ambushes will
most probably be limited to situations where two or
more undertakings decide to collude in concealing rel-
evant information from the standard-setting organiz-
ation. Alternatively, it may be used to challenge licensing
agreements concluded between the patent holder (the
perpetrator of the patent ambush) and its licensees. The
justiﬁcation for applying Article 81(1) to such cases
would be the effect of such agreement of ‘excluding
actual or potential competitors from the market as a
result of non-transparent procedures’.70 This interpret-
ation has not yet been tested before the ECJ.

Article 82 EC
The drafters of the EC Treaty provided for Article 82 as
the response to unilateral conduct which may threaten
competition-related interests:

[a]ny abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant
position within the common market or in a substantial
part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the
common market insofar as it may affect trade between
Member States.

By virtue of Article 82, only abuse of the dominant
position is prohibited, not the creation of dominance.
That is limited by application of the Merger Control
Regulation 139/200471 to the extent an undertaking
strives for a dominant position through acquiring
control over other participants of the market.

In contrast, the US law offers a wider array of legal
bases for identifying anticompetitive unilateral beha-
viour by prohibiting acts of unfair competition.72
Under EC law, these types of behaviour may be prohib-
ited only to the extent they constitute an abuse of a
dominant position. It is, however, possible that a uni-
lateral conduct remaining outside the scope of Article

The patent ambush scenario may cover a number of
situations in the context of Article 82. These situations
may range from a non-dominant undertaking achiev-
ing a substantive market position as a result of the
application of the standard based on proprietary tech-
nology which was not disclosed in the drafting process,
to a dominant market player directing the standard
drafting process to promote its products or proprietary
solutions. Depending on relative market strength of
the participants and characteristics of
the market,
those situations may constitute abuses of a dominant
position.

In order to apply Article 82 in patent ambush cases,
market dominance must be established. Under EC
competition law dominance, abuse of the dominant
position and the effects of such abuse may all take
place in different relevant markets.73 As the European
Commission explains,74 justiﬁcation for intervention
under Article 82 will require establishing a relevant
market, dominant position, and the abusive behaviour,
for example (i) application of discriminatory licensing
terms, and/or (ii) demanding excessive royalties, and/or
(iii) refusal to license in order to monopolize a down-
stream market.

In technology markets, the difﬁculty in deﬁning the
scope of the relevant market and the abuse lies in the
fact that the practice in question may cover not only
the patent claimed but in the fact that the claimed
technology may be used, for instance, to achieve inter-
operability with other technologies. In many cases, the
standards also form a part of a product system, which
also poses difﬁculties in deﬁning the relevant market.
Additionally, technological change and progress must
be considered. Depending on the development of the
standard (or competing standards or technologies), an
undertaking may not be found to be dominant on the
relevant market even if it commits a patent ambush.

Another important issue is collective dominance.75
Provided the criteria are met, the members of a stan-
dard-setting organization may be held to be collectively
dominant on the relevant market. This calls for special
attention with regard to all
forms of co-operation

undertaken by the members. Nevertheless, the ECJ held
that, in the markets characterized by collective domi-
nance, individual abuse is possible.76

The ECJ has deﬁned the concept of a dominant pos-
ition as the possession of economic strength which
enables a business to prevent effective competition in
the relevant market by affording it the power to behave
to an appreciable extent independently of competitors,
customers, and consumers.77 In general terms, the EU
notion of dominance covers more divergent situations,
broader restrictions, and requires a lower standard of
proof than the Sherman Act antitrust concept of mono-
polization. Similarly to US law, holding a monopoly
position is not itself illegal.

There is a general presumption of dominance where
an undertaking holds a market share exceeding 50 per
cent78 (though dominant positions has been held to
exist in cases of undertakings having a 20 per cent
market share).79 Market share is not, however, enough
as analysis of dominance must take into consideration
competitive constraints over the undertaking’s activities
on the market.

Analysis of dominance must take into
consideration competitive constraints over
the undertaking’s activities on the market

In the context of technology markets, those competi-
tive constraints will include (i) alternative technologies
available, (ii) costs and time effort required to develop
such technologies, and (iii) potential competition (new
entrants).

One must also distinguish between the relevant
market as existing at the moment the patent ambush
practice is employed and the relevant market which
will be created once the standard is in place (the tech-
nology market). The ambusher will usually not be
dominant in the former but most probably will enjoy a
dominant position in the latter. If, however, the tech-
nology market may be deﬁned based on the assump-
tions which could have reasonably been made on the
moment of drafting the standard (and related non-

possibility to retaliate against a competitor who wants to depart from
status quo and the fact that third parties are not in a position to disturb
the balance; T-102/96 Gencor [1999] ECR II-753; T-342/992 Airtours

disclosure), the patent ambush strategy may be deemed
an abuse of an (anticipated) dominant position. Deﬁning
the relevant market on the basis of assumptions which
could have reasonably been made at the moment of
non-disclosure (because this is the moment when the
abuse is committed) is speculative80 and therefore risky
for the competition authority.

To sum up, if analysis leads to a conclusion there is
no option to invent around the IP rights that are cap-
tured in the standard within a reasonable time and
incurring reasonable costs and the IP rights holder is in
a position to control the (deﬁned) relevant market
through extraction of royalties and/or licence fees for
his technology included in the industry standard, then
this company may be abusing its dominant position.

There are, however, several possible justiﬁcations

which weigh heavily against establishing abuse.

First is that the technology adopted in the standard is
simply the best available technology, which would have
been adopted regardless of whether any patent or appli-
cation was disclosed by the company? In such a scenario,
a dominant position may be considered reached by
competition on its merits (result of a superior technol-
ogy) and any subsequent abuse of this dominant pos-
ition would be unrelated to the patent ambush.

While asserting rights under a patent is not of itself an
abuse,81 abuse of a dominant position may apply if a
party chooses to combine the patent ambush with a sub-
sequent form of abusive conduct such as discriminatory
licensing policy or exclusionary practices vis-a`-vis its com-
petitors aimed at eliminating them from the standardized
product market. However, even refusal to license will only
exceptionally be treated as a prohibited abusive conduct.82
One may, however, argue that the company commit-
ting a patent abuse and later becoming dominant
through dissemination of the standard will be punished
for reaching a dominant position since the EC Treaty
prohibits only abuse of the dominant position, not its
creation. Lastly, if a business cannot be held dominant
the moment it elects to keep its patents conﬁdential in
the course of the standardization process, Article 82 EC
cannot apply. In contrast to section 5 of the FTC Act,
EC law contains no unfair trading rules.

Piotr Staniszewski . The interplay between IP rights and competition law

laws in EU
ations anticompetitive? National patent
Member States contain legal rules on amending, broad-
ening, or narrowing patent applications. As far as the
actions of the undertaking in question follow those
rules, any misconduct will be difﬁcult to prove.83

Also, while Article 82 contains no provision corre-
sponding to Article 81(3), the European Commission’s
review process nevertheless contains elements of evalu-
ation in certain cases of abuse of dominant position.84
In conclusion, the problems of patent ambush may
be addressed well by unfair competition or general civil
law (or the law of obligations), and not necessarily
within the Article 82 framework.

X/Open Group
X/Open Group85 was the ﬁrst case where the European
Commission tackled issues of standardization in the
context of competition law. A group of companies
notiﬁed an agreement regarding the establishment of a
‘common application environment’
and ‘standard
interfaces’. The Commission held the agreement to fall
within Article 81(1), being open to certain participants
of the market holding a market share higher than the
de minimis threshold.

The arrangement was subsequently exempted under
Article 81(3) as the beneﬁts from creation of the stan-
dard outweighed any contemplated restrictions of
competition. In particular, the agreement fostered tech-
nological progress by establishing a common appli-
cation environment for UNIX software. The beneﬁt for
consumers resulted from a wider choice of applications
which, lacking the envisaged standard, would not have
been available. Furthermore, the agreement did not
offer the possibility to eliminate competition in the rel-
evant market.

ETSI
A case arose in 199586 when ETSI adopted a draft IP
right policy which required the participants to license
all technology necessary for a standard unless the right
holder expressly reserved the right
to refrain from
licensing the rights thus identiﬁed. The deadline for
raising any reservation expired after 80 days following
the date of commencing the standard development

process. Accepting this IP right policy was a condition
for joining the organization.

The Commission did not approve the ex ante licen-
sing rules, as in its view those were restrictive to inno-
vation and constituted agreements prohibited under
Article 81(1).

Following amendments to ETSI Directives,

in the
event of discovery that a solution contemplated in the
standard is a subject of a patent belonging to an ETSI
member or a third party, ETSI may decide to invent
‘around the patent’ or cease work on the standard.
Where the patent holder is an ETSI member,
the
the holder to reconsider the
organization may call
refusal. Finally,
if the existence of the patent comes
to the attention of ETSI after it adopts the standard,
the organization may seek to remove recognition of
the standard as a European Standard under EC Direc-
tive 98/34.87

In March 2006, the European Commission closed a
second investigation regarding ETSI standard-setting
rules. Its allegations concerned the need to ensure
adequate protection against ‘patent ambush’ in ETSI
procedures. Following the Commission’s inquiry, the
ETSI IP rights disclosure rules were strengthened by
amplifying the requirement of early disclosure of those
rights which are essential for implementation of the
standard.

In accordance with the Commission’s lenient atti-
tude in the new Guidelines on technology transfer
agreements,88 ETSI announced plans to adopt an ex
ante licensing policy which may be pro-competitive,
provided certain safeguards are in place.

German law
In July 2004, the Bundesgerichtshof 89 held that,
in
light of
the German Law against Restrictions of
Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschra¨nkungen),
a patent holder who enjoys a dominant position
commits a breach of the non-discrimination principle
when it deploys its licensing policy to limit access to
markets in accordance with criteria which contravene
free competition. The patent holder’s refusal to license
effectively prohibited a competitor from marketing its

Measures to counteract patent
ambushes
In seeking to counteract potential patent ambushes, stan-
dard-setting organizations have taken several measures to
neutralize the threat, focusing on procedures that are easy
to monitor and do not involve taking decisions on sub-
stantive matters on the enforcer’s part. These procedural
safeguards concentrate on (i) IP rights search, (ii) IP
rights disclosure, and (iii) licensing terms (including roy-
alties). All three sets of measures are an important factor
regarding contemplated participation in the standard-
setting organizations and inﬂuence competitive behaviour
on the market.

The standardization process extends over time and
during this period new solutions may be invented,
sometimes even in remote areas of a participant’s
activity which might read on contents of the contem-
plated standard. Not all standard-setting organizations
require its participants to conduct a patent search in
the context of standard-drafting processes. Bearing this
in mind, the dynamic of the standardization process,
is difﬁcult90 and even
searching a ‘moving target’
extensive IP rights search regulations, binding on stan-
dard-setting organization participants, may not bring
the envisaged results.

The disclosure element has an impact on the appli-
cant’s competitive strategy, in particular when it is not
clear what scope of disclosure is actually required by the
standard-setting organization. From the applicant’s point
of view, once the information is released and he is even-
tually denied a patent, he loses protection of his property
via trade secret protection.91 Thus, there may be valid
reasons to limit information disclosed solely to the exist-
ence of patent applications concerning solutions which
are contemplated in the standardization process.92

Another disclosure-based risk arises from the fact
that the information on patents and patent applications
is directed to specialists in the given ﬁeld. A learned
engineer may have no difﬁculty in discovering the sub-
stance of a new patent claim based on the combination
of his own knowledge with information contained in
the disclosure statement. Further, once the applicant

91 Eg in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty 1970, a patent

application.

divulges information on pending patent applications,
he simultaneously informs his competitors also on the
ﬁelds of research in which he is inactive. Such infor-
mation may be valuable for other market players.

Standard-setting organizations usually require infor-
mation on existing patents but do not always require
information on patent
applications. A particular
problem of patent applications is that they may be
subject to subsequent amendments, extensions, or nar-
rowing of their scope. However, matching a dynamic
process of standardization with disclosure of dynami-
cally amended patent applications would be burdensome
on standard-setting organization participants. Politically,
this may be a very important disincentive to participate
in the standardization process; especially when com-
bined with the risks of disclosure discussed above.

In many instances, a disclosure requirement

is
further restricted to the ‘actual knowledge’ of the repre-
sentative of the applicant attending standard-setting
organization meetings.93 Consequently, when the rules
are taken literally, the risk of wilful blindness on the
part of representatives is difﬁcult to avoid. Such formu-
lations of the organizations’ by-laws restrict the scope
of potential fraud or misrepresentation, thus making it
even harder to prove infringements of competition law.
From the same perspective, the more limited the
scope of disclosure,
the less the risk of concerted
practice conducted by standard-setting organization
members:
information
exchange being treated as a ‘concerted practice’ or
‘facilitating practice’ is a factor which the organization
should take into consideration.

Piotr Staniszewski . The interplay between IP rights and competition law

organization rules are unclear. Allowing an applicant ‘to
prevail on a theory of business justiﬁcations in the face of
clear disclosure rules is akin to allowing business torts and
contract violations as business
justiﬁcations on the
grounds that these acts were proﬁtable’.94

to the amount of

Reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms
The purpose of RAND licence terms is to bind the
standard-setting organization member to use terms,
particularly as
royalties, which
remain within the ‘reasonable and non-discretionary’
limit. Those terms will apply where the adopted stan-
dard contains an IP right belonging to a standard-
setting organization member. By anticipating RAND
terms, exploiting undisclosed IP rights suffer important
constraints, as going beyond agreed RAND terms may
entail liability for breach of contract and/or undertak-
ing actions of unfair competition.

By-laws of standard-setting organizations may also
contain sanctions for breach of RAND terms consisting
of reverting the standard back for consideration by the
standard-setting organization or withdrawal of
the
standard altogether.95

The anticompetitive risk arises when predeﬁned licen-
sing terms may be regarded as a concerted practice of
setting prices or delimiting markets by standard-setting
organization members. The RAND terms themselves are
thus usually left open for the patent holder to specify. To
neutralize the threat of anticompetitive conduct further,
by-laws distinguish expressly between disclosure and
negotiations in the standard-setting process from discus-
sions on licensing terms and royalty rates.96

The ex post approach, however, essentially results in
negotiation of
licensing terms only after the patent
holder has gained a market position, augmented (or
even created) by his IP rights embedded in the stan-
dard. Logically, the terms negotiated will not necess-
arily be the most favourable for most of the remaining
participants in the market. Thus, even if the patent
holder agrees to RAND terms where he failed to dis-
close the relevant right, he will nevertheless have given
himself a better negotiation position. The practice of
negotiating RAND terms, viewed from this angle, may

sometimes act as a disincentive against ex ante due
disclosure.

Against this, the ex ante disclosure and negotiation
approach may act as a disincentive to participate in stan-
dard-setting organizations. However, once ex ante nego-
tiations are duly conducted and competitive RAND
terms are adopted, the only reasoning to support an ex
post approach is to extract supracompetitive proﬁts from
the IP right. Except for this aim of the IP right holder,
there should be no reason to opt for ex post negotiation,
once ex ante terms represent fair practice of the market.

Regardless of the option preferred, ex ante or ex post,
the essential practical problem with deﬁning the RAND
terms lies in the considerations that (i) in the ex ante
option it is difﬁcult to anticipate the prospective value
of the right protected once it is included in the stan-
dard and (ii) in the ex post approach it is troublesome
to estimate the value if the standard gains popularity
and confers market power on the IP right holder.

None of the authorities called to enforce competition
law is well placed to deﬁne RAND terms and loyalties.
Reﬂecting on possible differences of positions regarding
what constitutes RAND, in Magill,97 concerning compul-
sory licensing, the ECJ nominated a special tribunal to
decide the terms and calculate the respective amounts.

None of the authorities called to enforce
competition law is well placed to define
RAND terms and loyalties

In contrast the ex ante solution, preferred by some
authors,98 may effectively eliminate patent ambush pro-
blems. When the price of the technology incorporated
in the standard is deﬁned ex ante, the holder of rights
in that technology cannot charge royalties exceeding
the predeﬁned price without incurring a substantial
legal risk.

RAND terms
The deﬁnition of ‘default’ RAND licence terms entails a
risk of treating those terms as prohibited cartels where
they may amount to price-ﬁxing or delimitation of
markets.99

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2007, Vol. 2, No. 10

Postponing negotiation of licence terms until after
the standard has been adopted brings, however, the
following problems: (i) a delay in implementing the
standard, as time will be needed to deﬁne the licence
terms; (ii) a risk of rejecting the standards by market
participants if they view the terms as unfavourable.

An option to submit RAND to arbitration may help
reduce the risks of overly burdensome terms, but may
bring even more severe delays in implementation.

RAND royalties
In deﬁning RAND royalties for using the standard
incorporating patented solutions, the patent holder will
not be entirely free to set the quantum. The US courts
for instance will verify the amount of ‘reasonable’ roy-
alties by reference to industry custom and fees charged
for use of patents in related industries.100 European
courts may well adopt a similar approach.

Agreement of RAND royalties in advance in quanti-
tative terms, as opposed to deﬁning the method of cal-
culation, may entail legal risks. Such agreements may
be classiﬁed as ‘price ﬁxing’ under section 1 of the
Sherman Act or as an agreement directly or indirectly
to ﬁx purchase or selling prices or any other trading
conditions under Article 81(1)(a).

However, once the ‘price-ﬁxing’ element is necessary
in order to reach pro-competitive results and this
restriction is proportional, under European Commu-
nity law it may be exempted from the general prohibi-
tion by Article 81(3).101 Also, ex ante negotiation and
determination of RAND royalties may beneﬁt consu-
mers, by lowering prices for products which include
the standard (particularly where patents are stacked in
one standard solution).102

Ex ante negotiation of RAND royalties also beneﬁts
the patent holder. Such conduct shows the participant as
a valuable, reliable member of an organization. In return,
the solutions proposed by this member may be more
likely to be accepted by the forum, as its previous prac-
tice will show that the inventor pursues no deceptive
tactics. By-laws rarely (if ever) preclude members from
negotiating on their own initiative of the level of royalties

before the standard is implemented. The danger however
may lie in mandatory determination of royalties.

As regards determination of the amount of RAND
it has been suggested103 that the aggregate
royalties,
royalty should be divided between the amount attribu-
table to the demand for the invention and that attribu-
table to demand created by adoption of the standard.
The patent holder should not be entitled to the latter,
while the former
reasonable
remuneration for innovative effort. Thus, the quantum
should be calculated solely on the basis of technological
contribution to the standard, not the interoperability
achieved by it.

should constitute his

Finally, the practice of some standard-setting organ-
izations, to provide in their by-laws for an obligation
to license IP rights royalty-free,
likely to
infringe Article 81(1) and cannot be objectively justi-
ﬁed.104 Regardless of competition law, this solution
may also discourage participation in standard-setting
organizations.

Important—but prone to abuse
Standardization processes are very important factors in
the development of the economy, especially in its high-
technology sector. These processes, however, are also
prone to abuse, deceit, misrepresentations—all directed
at extracting supracompetitive beneﬁts as a result of
successful standardization. At some level, no doubt, law
should protect the process. However, as indicated, the
currently available tools in the antitrust ﬁeld are not
necessarily the most effective response.

As Magdalena Brenning, a representative of

the
European Commission’s DG Competition to an
American Bar Association International Roundtable,
said in July 2002:

As for Article 82, one must recall that unlike U.S. law, liab-
ility arises only for abuse of dominance, not anticompeti-
tive creation thereof. Showing abuse may be problematic
in a patent ambush context. The EC, moreover, has no
equivalent to the Federal Trade Commission Act, which
was the statutory basis for liability in Dell. To demonstrate
this point: where a non-dominant [standard setting organ-

Laboratories 926 F.2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 1991). This practice is subject to
certain difﬁculties of deﬁnition. In 1995, in litigation between Rockwell
and Motorola over modem standard V.34 it was not clear even, whether
the reasonable terms should be determined with regard to terms
Motorola would have obtained on the market ex ante or the terms
Motorola could use ex post, once it had a market power derived from its
patents; US District Court for the District of Delaware in Motorola, Inc.

Piotr Staniszewski . The interplay between IP rights and competition law

FTC is equipped with legal measures unavailable to
European enforcers,105 most crucial cases were resolved
by consent orders. These, however, are not equipped
with a power of precedent and do not therefore consti-
tute law.

The relevance of

reﬂected by recent allegations

the problems described here is
well
raised against
Qualcomm. That company is alleged to hold a patent
on an essential element of 3G mobile technology. The
mobile handset manufacturers accuse Qualcomm of
illegal refusal to license the patent and further of mis-
leading the standardization process regarding licensing
Qualcomm’s technology on RAND terms and, conse-
quently of charging (or rather intending to charge)
excessive royalties. In summary, patent ambush cases
are an element of the current picture of legal issues
behind a globalized economy. But will law and enforce-
ment arrive with adequate responses to the problem?
Imposing undue obstacles in standard-setting organiz-
ation participation, however, may hamper standardiz-
ation processes which are beneﬁcial to the economy as
a whole.

ization] member intentionally conceals a patent that reads
on the ultimate standard, and thereby becomes dominant as
a result, is difﬁcult to say liability arises under Article 82.
Similarly, the subsequent assertion of IP rights against other
members of the [standard setting organisation] may not
constitute abuse of dominance, since the patent itself was
properly granted in the ﬁrst place. The only apparent area
for Article 82 liability might arise if the IP holder applies
unfair licence terms, engages in excessive pricing or refuses
to license in order to monopolize a downstream market.

This passage summarizes the problem European Com-
munity competition faces with patent ambush. So far
there has been no antitrust case based on Articles 81 or
82 and most European Commission practice is based
rather on negotiations with the organizations con-
cerned than enforcement as such.

In Europe important

tools to counteract patent
ambushes may be found in unfair competition legis-
lation. The drawback of this approach, however,
lies
with the lack of a centralized application and the cost
of litigation, which must be borne by private parties.
The example of Rambus v Inﬁneon shows that this sol-
ution too may be subject to important limitations.

The history of patent ambush cases in US antitrust
practice suggests a similar approach. Even though the
