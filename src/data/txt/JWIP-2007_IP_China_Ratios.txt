Intellectual Property System in China: A
Study of the Grant Lags and Ratios

Deli Yang
Bradford University School of Management

This article examines the intellectual property (IP) system in China with a particular focus on
grant lags and grant ratios in patents, utility models, industrial designs and trademarks of
residents and non-residents. The ﬁndings are derived from the empirical study of IP statistics
(1985–2002). They demonstrate that trademark applicants endure the longest and patents
enjoy the shortest grant lags in China according to the best models, and residents are overall
more favoured than non-residents. The research concludes that national treatment of
residents and non-residents should apply in both economic policy and practice, which also
provides a new research domain.

The intellectual property system (IPS) remains nation-based despite conforming to
the broad standardization of an international IPS. IP here refers to the rights given
to owners for their intellectual creations of the mind, typiﬁed by copyrights for
literary and artistic work, patents for inventions, utility models for small inventions,
industrial designs for artistic designs with industrial applications and marks for
products and services (Cornish, 2001). An IPS refers to the system of a nation to
regulate, administer and protect these rights (Thompson, 1993; Yang, 2003). In the
last two decades, immeasurable effort has been made internationally to integrate
nations into an international IPS. This research deﬁnes an international IPS as the
international standardization of the legal mechanism, administration and dispute
settlements for IP towards congruence across nations in the forms of treaties,
conventions and agreements (TCAs). Within the broad framework of international
standardization, IPS is nation-based in nature. As Massel (1973, p. 647) argued:
‘‘Probably no two systems are exactly alike . . . . They operate within the conﬁnes of
a single nation’’. In other words, each nation regulates, administers and enforces IP
in its own manner. The divergence in practising the IPS across the world makes
study in this area vital to provide information for policy making and policy
research.

Nonetheless, previous research shows that this important research ﬁeld has
only been sporadically studied. Despite the on-going debates on whether an IPS is
economically beneﬁcial (Aoki and Prusa, 1996; Bessen, 2005; Gilbert and Shapiro,
1990; Lanjouw et al., 1998; Levin, 1986; Mazzoleni and Nelson, 1998; Ordover,
1991; Penin, 2005; Scherer et al., 1959; Taylor and Silberston, 1973), an IPS has
been established by almost all the countries across the world. A new debate has

consequentially become heated as to whether such a system will function effectively;
for example whether developing countries will beneﬁt from adopting a western IPS
and whether developed countries will have their IP protected, given the concern of
inadequate IPS in developing countries (Barton, 2004; Benko, 1988; Dutﬁeld, 2004;
Gervais, 1998; Ismail and Fakir, 2004; Lai and Qiu, 2003; Lall, 2003; Lamy, 2004;
Maskus and Lahouel, 2000; Massel, 1973; O’Brien, 1974; Patel, 1974; Penrose,
1973; Reichman, 2000; Sood, 1998; Subramanian, 1990; Subramanian and Watal,
2000; Yang and Sonmez, 2003). Moreover, comparative studies are also attracting
interest with a particular focus on comparisons between developed countries, such
as Japan, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom (Aoki and Prusa,
1996; Helfgott, 1990; Kotabe, 1992; Thompson, 1993). Additionally, IPSs in
individual countries have also been examined, including the United States (Barton,
2000; Gallini, 2002; Jaffe, 2000; Khan and Sokoloff, 2001; Sherwood, 1984), China
(Bosworth and Yang, 2002; Sun, 2003; Yang, 2003) and Singapore (Ching, 2002).
However, a more speciﬁc issue related to the IPS—grant lags and ratios in China—
appears to have never been investigated.

This study aims to examine the IPS in China, with a particular focus on the
grant lags and grant ratios between residents and non-residents in patents, utility
models, industrial designs and trademarks. Here, grant lag refers to the length of
time between an IP application and its grant; it is also termed as pendency (Kotabe,
1992) and pending period (Bosworth and Yang, 2002). Grant ratios refer to the
number of IP grants out of total applications. Despite comparing and contrasting
the patent (for patents, utility models and industrial designs) and trademark systems
in China, this research will address the similarities and differences of the grant lags
and grant ratios for residents’ and non-residents’ applications across the four IP
categories. Such an investigation will allow the research to conclude which IP right
is treated favourably and whether residents are favoured against non-residents in
terms of grant lags and grant ratios, or vice versa. The study will be conducted with
IP statistical data from the World IP Organization (WIPO) and State IP Ofﬁce
(SIPO) in China using a lagged regression model (Kotabe, 1992) and validation test
(Bryant, 1966; Cohen and Cohen, 2002).

This research contributes theoretical and empirical knowledge to the IPS
studies. Early discussions about previous research suggest that the areas of grant
lags and grant ratios have been under-researched. Despite some sporadic studies
about patents, other IP has had little attention. This issue, however, is particularly
important because it is ‘‘the most direct indicators of industrial innovative activity’’
(Kotabe and Cox, 1993). In other words, the balance between residents and non-
residents in IP activities indicates whether a nation is competitive innovatively in
comparison with foreign countries. This research thereby contributes theoretical
knowledge by examining all the IP rights, instead of patents only, as in previous
research. The empirical scarcity of this research ﬁeld also prompted this study:
although China’s IPS has attracted great attention among researchers, the study of
grant lags and grant ratios appears to be a blank spot. This research contributes

r  r 23

empirical knowledge of China to the previous studies of developed countries,
thereby attracting research interests in developing countries.

This article is structured as follows. The second section discusses the IPS in
China,
including IP laws, administration and enforcement. The third surveys
previous research relevant to grant lags and ratios and formulates hypotheses.
The fourth discusses the sources of information, the analytical model and equality
testing formulae. The ﬁfth section analyses the descriptive data, including growth
index and grant lags and ratios. The ﬁnal section discusses the results in comparison
with previous research. Moreover, research implications will be drawn from the
results for policy makers. Finally, research limitations are discussed to provide
directions for future policy research.

IPS in China

IPS and Objectives
IPS can be understood in both a narrow and a broad sense. In a narrow sense, it
refers to the examinations and grants of IP applications, promotion of IP protection
at home and abroad, and dissemination of IP knowledge by publications (Thomp-
son, 1993). In other words, the narrow scope of IPS is closely related to the
administration of IP rights in a country. In a broad sense, this research believes that
IPS also includes the legislative guidance and judicial enforcement in addition to IP
administration. Here, legislative guidance includes the understanding of the legal
system, legislature and legal mechanism in guiding IP activities and protecting IP
rights (Yang and Clarke, 2004). Administrative control refers to the narrow sense of
an IPS, including relevant administrative organs and their functions in handling IP
applications. Judicial enforcement refers to the court hierarchy and their ways of
handling IP disputes and execution. This research argues that the broad sense is
more reﬂective of the IPS, as administrative control is based on legal instructions
and is necessary for judicial support. Their inseparable relations reﬂect that the
adequacy of legislation, administration and enforcement establishes the founda-
tions of a strong IPS. In line with this discussion, this section will pay particular
attention to the IPS functions.

China is explicit about the objectives of establishing an IPS. The patent system
in China aims to ‘‘protect patent rights for inventions-creations, to encourage
invention-creation, to foster the spreading and application of inventions-creations
and to promote the development and innovation of science and technology, for
meeting the needs of the construction of socialist modernization’’ (Patent Law of
the People’s Republic of China [Patent Law of the PRC], article 1). The trademark
system is aimed at ‘‘improving the administration of trademarks, protecting the
exclusive right to use trademarks, and encouraging producers and operators to
guarantee the quality of their goods and services and maintaining the reputation of
their trademarks, with a view to protecting the interests of consumers, producers
and operators and to promoting the development of the socialist market economy’’.

The patent and trademark systems are comparable and contrastable. Both
objectives share the same principle, i.e. to serve socialist economic development.
They both emphasize the importance of the government duty to encourage IP
activities. However, the different nature of these two systems shows that distinct
objectives are sought to serve the country’s purposes of economic development. The
patent system places great emphasis on diffusion (Sun, 2003). The wide diffusion of
technology is implemented through protection, encouragement, applications and
promotion of technological creations. This reﬂects the Chinese government’s
intention to advance its technological level. As for the trademark system, given
the non-technological nature in comparison with the patent system, the objective
emphasis has switched to clarify the duties of different parties,
including the
government and trademark owners. The government duty is administration,
protection, encouragement and promotion of trademark activities; trademark
owners have the responsibility for trademark quality, reputation and interests for
themselves and consumers.

Legal Guidance of the IPS
The legal guidance of the IPS is three fold: legal system, legislature and legal
mechanism. China adopts a legal system of civil law. In other words, judges rely on
the meaning of legal code to pursue the truthfulness of a dispute and actively
participate in debates with the defending lawyers and juries. This differs from the
common law regime where judges reply on precedent, social norms and rational
public policy to interpret the meaning of the law, act as a neutral referee in court
and make a verdict on the basis of the legal defence and jury decisions (Cooter and
Ulen, 1997). The reliance on meaning in a civil law regime like China may create
more hindrance than assistance in the IPS. This is because the development of IP
tends to fall behind technological progress, making the IP law unspeciﬁc to guide IP
activities (Maskus, 2000; Wagman and Scoﬁeld, 1999) and leaves too much
unexplained in the law (Teece, 1986). In addition, given the fact that China only
formed its IPS in the last two decades, it implies that the IP laws are bound to lack
clarity. Moreover, the court system has only a 20-year establishment in China; this
implies that lawyers and judges need time to build their experience. As a result,
uniformity of judicial decisions may be undermined in the process of dispute
settlement.

China adopts a two-tier legislature. The central government—the National
People’s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee—as the top tier of legislature,
is the state legislative body to enact IP laws, supervise legal enforcement and
nominate or remove Supreme Court presidents (Constitution of the PRC 1993,
articles 58 and 62–3). Relevant to the ﬁrst-tier legislature is the state council. The
highest administrative body of China is responsible for drafting legislative bills for
the NPC and its Standing Committee. Additionally, it also has legislative power to
issue regulations. For example, the Patent Law of the PRC 2001 was enacted by the
NPC, but the Implementation Regulations of the Patent Law of the PRC 2001 was

r  r 25

Deli Yang

issued by the state council. The second-tier legislature includes the Provincial NPC
and their Standing Committees at the levels of provinces, autonomous regions,
municipal cities and ministerial governments under the state council (Constitution
of the PRC 1993, article 100). Their legislative power tends to reﬂect the local needs
and interests in the form of rules and departmental rules and regulations, respec-
tively, in line with the ﬁrst-tier legislation (Constitution of the PRC 1993, articles 90
and 116).

The two-tier legislature in China has created both ﬂexibility and barriers for the
operations of the IPS. The ﬂexibility is reﬂected in the government allowing
ministerial and provincial governments to stipulate their rules and regulations on
the basis of their needs and interests. This therefore allows the relevant IP
organizations to stipulate more speciﬁc policy in IP. As a result, for IP, China
has at least four sets of legal code—law, regulations, rules and departmental rules
and regulations relevant to a particular product. However, IP ﬁrms unfamiliar with
the legislature may have a dubious impression as to which legal code to follow if
clear instructions are not provided (Yang, 2003).

The legal mechanism of the IPS has two important characteristics. It refers here
to the body of IP laws and regulations that regulate the operations of the IPS. First,
the IP mechanism is established in the form of a quadruple-set legal code for all the
IP rights. In other words, they are available for people to consult in the form of law
(e.g. patent law), regulations (e.g. implementation regulations of the patent law),
departmental rules and regulations (e.g. trade-related IP from the Ministry of
Commerce), and rules (provincial stipulations). Second, the entire IP mechanism
was established in the 1980s, going through two revisions soon afterwards. This
indicates that the legal mechanism of the IPS is relatively new, implying the need for
interpretation. For example, the Trademark Law of the PRC was enacted in 1982
and was revised in 1993 and 2001.

Administrative Control

Administrative Organs
The administrative control
is related to the administrative organs and their
responsibilities to handle IP. Different from most developed countries, the Chinese
IPS administers patents and trademarks separately, including the SIPO for patents
and the Trademark Ofﬁce for marks. However, they share the common duties of
examining IP applications, interpreting IP laws, supervising IP activities, dissemi-
nating IP and administratively settling disputes (Yang and Clarke, 2004). Both
organs were established in the 1980s, with the SIPO being renamed from the Patent
Ofﬁce in 1998. The other difference of the administrative organs from Western
countries is its additional duties:
interpretation of the law and administrative
settlement of dispute. This is relevant to the non-speciﬁc nature of the relatively
new law and the Chinese tradition of heavily relying on government for dispute
resolution, instead of doing so through the courts (Yang, 2005). In addition, the
Chinese government also encourages dispute resolution through consultation,

26

r  r Intellectual Property System in China

mediation and arbitration before seeking court resolution (Patent Law 2001,
article 57).

IP Administration
The IP administration can be discussed under four main topics: subject, procedure,
grants and administrative remedies as shown in Table 1. Despite invention patent
protection, the patent law in China also encompasses the protection of utility
models and industrial designs. However, the substantive requirements for these two
rights are simpler than the invention patent. Like most countries adopting an IPS,
China has also adopted a ﬁrst-to-ﬁle system, i.e. whoever ﬁles an application of
patent or trademark ﬁrst will be considered as the potential owner of such a right.
Trademark administration encompasses trademark, service mark, collective mark
(association-owned mark for use by members) and certiﬁcation mark (association-
owned mark for use by members and outsiders on condition of quality guarantee).
The substantive requirements for a trademark are that it is distinctive and non-
identical or similar to the already registered marks.

With regard to procedural matters, different treatments have been provided to
different IP rights. Invention and utility model patents have the priority right of 12
months, but 6 months for industrial designs (Patent Law 2001, article 29) and for
trademark marks (Trademark Law of the PRC 2001, article 24). Invention and
utility model inventions enjoy 12-month priority rights, while industrial designs and
trademarks have 6 months. Automatic publication applies for all patents, but
trademark publications appear upon approval. In addition, only invention patent
applications require substance examination for which request should be made
within 3 years of ﬁling. When an application is rejected, trademark and patent
applicants have different restrictions for requesting re-examination (15 days for
marks and 3 months for patents), but their days available for legal proceedings are
the same. As far as foreign applications are concerned, trademark and patent
applications are treated the same, requiring an agency designated by the Chinese
government.

The post-grant matters are also treated differently. Apart from invention
patents with a 20-year duration, all other rights are granted for a 10-year period.
Moreover, trademark owners are able to have their marks renewed indeﬁnitely
every 10 years subject to continuous use. All these IP applications require fees. In
comparison, the application fee of an invention patent is RMB Yuan 900, utility
model Yuan 500 and trademark RMB Yuan 1000 (State Administration for
Industry and Commerce [SAIC], 2005; SIPO, 2005). Different from trademarks,
compulsory licensing is allowed in patent activities where non-exclusive grants may
be authorized by SIPO (Implementation Regulation 2001, rule 14). China places
great emphasis on compulsory licensing for the purpose of wider diffusion of
technologies. Government approval is needed for licensing a patent abroad, but this
appears unnecessary for trademarks. This indicates government protection in
controlling the outﬂow of indigenous technologies.

Intellectual Property System in China

Finally, all these conventional IP rights are protected with administrative
remedies. For trademarks, damage can be compensated based on up to three times
the illegal earnings or up to RMB Yuan 100,000 if the former cannot be ascertained.
In contrast, a similar remedy with regard to the illegal earnings applies for patents,
but the ﬁne is lower: at up to 50,000 Yuan. Overall, administrative remedies in
China are encouraged because court resolution is regarded as the last resort for both
trademark and patent activities. A case in point is the administrative remedies of
dispute cases. SIPO (2003) reports that, in 2002, it received 1,517 dispute cases, with
82% being successfully resolved. According to Wen (1996), less than 7% of cases
were brought further for legal resolutions.

Judicial Enforcement
China adopts a four-tier court system (Yang and Clarke, 2004). The single top
tier—Supreme People’s Court—is directly answerable to the NPC and its Standing
Committee. Higher People’s Courts are set up at provincial and municipal levels;
below is the Intermediate People’s Courts at the provincial city level. Basic-Level
People’s Court is the bottom tier responsible for matters at the town and county
level. Relevant to IP matters, dispute litigation can be instituted,
in the ﬁrst
instance, at an Immediate People’s Court or Higher People’s Court depending on
the location where the litigant resides. China adopts a court-hearing system of the
second proceeding as ﬁnal. In other words, a case can be pursued to a higher court if
a litigant is dissatisﬁed with the verdict from the ﬁrst instance, but the second
proceeding is ﬁnal and no further proceedings are allowed. One landmark in the IP
judicial history of China is the establishment of Special People’s Courts above
Immediate People’s Courts in 1992 and within the Supreme People’s Court in 1996
(SIPO, 2003). Such a set-up allows for IP-related disputes to be handled with
efﬁciency, knowledge accumulation and standardization (Bosworth and Yang,
2002; Jaffe, 2000).

China’s judicial development of IP is considered to be at its infancy for three
reasons. First, historically, China was always a country with a centralized system of
government control. In other words, the country is policy driven instead of a legal
binding regime where people rely on government policy and instructions to bench-
mark their social behaviours. Second, the judicial system has only been established
for two decades. The court system was resumed in 1979 under the Open Door policy
(Liu, 1996). Third, judicial knowledge and experience also needs time to accumulate.
Examination for lawyers was only resumed in 1989. The human power of the lawyers
and judges needs time to strengthen in both quality and quantity, although these
professions have become increasingly popular (O’Connor and Lowe, 1996). Given
the above, China needs time to evolve a system, which is currently in transition from
a policy-driven to a legal-binding nation, for the court system to be accomplished, for
knowledge and experience accumulation of judicial human power.

In summary, the IPS in China serves the objectives of accelerating IP diffusion to
strike a balance between national and public interests and IP creators. In this diffusing

30

r  r Intellectual Property System in China

Deli Yang

process, an IP framework has been set up conforming to the broad standards of the
international IP organizations (WIPO and the World Trade Organization). However,
given the hasty establishment of this system, it would be impossible to have every
detail taken into account. Further development is therefore needed to clarify and
specify the legal mechanism, accumulate knowledge and experience in IP, strengthen
enforcement power and increase public awareness of IP.

Grant Lags and Grant Ratios

This section reviews previous literature on two speciﬁc issues related to the IPS:
grant lags and grant ratios. Grant lags and ratios demonstrate whether a govern-
ment is efﬁcient and effective in the operations of the IPS. Grant lags and ratios as a
subject have attracted little previous attention, although some sporadic studies were
conducted with an empirical focus on the triad power. Little attention has been
focused on China on this subject matter. This section therefore reviews the previous
research on this subject and formulates hypotheses to serve as an empirical study
about China in the subsequent sections.

Grant Lags
The study of grant lags is sporadic, patent-focused and triad-power concentrated. It
is sporadic because only a few authors have conducted this research (Gilbert and
Shapiro, 1990; Kotabe, 1992; Kotabe and Cox, 1993; Popp et al., 2003). As far as
the subject is concerned, previous studies pay particular attention to patent, the
most advanced form of IP, with other IP given little attention (Bosworth and Yang,
2002). Moreover, the empirical study of this subject is geographically concentrated
on developed countries, particularly technologically advanced triad power—the
European Union (EU), the United States and Japan.

Kotabe (1992) conducted a comparative study of the United States, Japan,
Germany and the United Kingdom using statistical data from WIPO (1963–88).
The ﬁndings show that Japan is biased towards residents, with shorter grant lag
than non-residents. Speciﬁcally, the grant lags for residents fall between zero and 3
years, with signiﬁcant levels above 80%. For non-resident applications, however,
only a 3-year grant lag shows signiﬁcance at the certainty level of slightly over 12%.
This indicates that Japanese inventors are highly likely to get a grant at any of the
3-year periods upon ﬁling patent applications. However, foreign applicants are
unlikely to be granted a patent until the third year of ﬁling. Kotabe’s study about
the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom generated a different result
from that of Japan. All three countries provide equal treatment in terms of the time
lag of the applications. The United States has up to 3-year grant lags for both
domestic and foreign applicants. The United Kingdom is more efﬁcient than the
United States with a grant lag of 2 years. Finally, German inventors only need
1 year to learn the outcome of their applications. Popp et al. (2003) concluded that
foreign applications take no longer than domestic applications because interna-
tional applications tend to be valuable inventions with ‘‘clear inventive steps’’ and

r  r 31

Deli Yang

Intellectual Property System in China

‘‘easier to examine’’ details. However, translation, communications, due-attorney
(for both home and the United States) and adjustment from multiple claims under
the European Cooperation Treaty to the single claim in the United States may add
to the length of time. Based on the above discussion, most countries studied by
previous research provide equal treatment to domestic and foreign applications in
terms of grant lags. Therefore, we hypothesize that:

H1: There is an equal grant lag for IP between domestic and foreign applications in
China, i.e.
H1a: There is an equal grant lag for patents between domestic and foreign
applications;
H1b: There is an equal grant lag for utility models between domestic and foreign
applications;
H1c: There is an equal grant lag for industrial designs between domestic and
foreign applications; and
H1d: There is an equal grant lag for trademarks between domestic and foreign
applications.

Popp et al. (2003) studied the determinants of grant lag in the United States
with statistical data of applications and grants and interviews with the US Patent
and Trademark Ofﬁce examiners. They concluded four important factors that delay
grants: technology type and complexities; application claim width; applicant
characteristics; and references citations. Technology complexities increase the
length of grant lag and form the most important reason to delay grants. For
example, biotechnology, computer applications, drugs and software patents tend to
take a longer time than technologies in other industries: Sun (2003) conducted a
study of grant determinants of foreign applications and concluded a similar result
about China. Based on the above discussions, we hypothesize:

H2: It takes a different length of time to have IP grants, i.e.
H2a: It takes a longer time to have invention patent grants than other IP rights;
H2b: It takes a longer time to have utility model patent grants than industrial
design and trademark grants; and
H2c: It takes a longer time to have industrial design grants than trademark grants.

Grant Ratios
Kotabe (1992) concluded that the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom
have a discriminative patent system in the way that domestic applications are
favoured with more grant ratios than foreign applications. This is in contrast with
the Japanese patent system where foreign applicants are discriminated with a longer
grant lag. Kotabe’s study concludes that countries discriminate against foreign
applications, but in different ways and to a different extent. The United States in
the 1980s had far more domestic grants than applications due to the handling of
backlog applications and an increase of examiners (Griliches, 1990; Popp et al.,

32

r  r Intellectual Property System in China

Deli Yang

2003). Such an accelerated procedure only applied to domestic applications. As a
result, domestic applicants are favoured in terms of patent grants. Although
Germany and the United Kingdom did not have a backlog issue to handle, they
also showed obvious preferential treatment to domestic applicants in grant ratios.
According to Kotabe’s (1992, p.162) ﬁndings, Germany awarded 10% more domestic
applications than foreign applications; the gap was larger for the United Kingdom
with 65 grants for domestic applications versus 21 foreign applications. As for Japan,
the government provided an equal treatment in patent grant ratios with no
discrimination. With regard to China, Bosworth and Yang (2002) concluded that
there were more foreign patent grants in China from 1985 to 1995. Foreign
applications concentrated on invention patents from advanced developed countries
(Bosworth and Yang, 2000; Sun, 2003). Statistically, foreign applications accounted
for 50% of the total invention applications and 61% of the total grants until 1995,
with the United States and Japan accounting for nearly 60% of the applications
(Bosworth and Yang, 2002). This demonstrates the high level of technologies from
these countries and also the emphasis of these countries on core technologies. In the
meantime, it also shows China’s desire to welcome advanced foreign technologies for
its economic development. On the basis of the above discussion, we hypothesize that:

H3: Foreign patent applications are more favoured with grants than domestic
patent applications.

According to the study by Bosworth and Yang (2000), non-invention patent
and trademark applications are dominated by domestic applicants. Such a striking
difference between invention patents and other IP is due to the dynamic activities in
lower-level technology categories conducted by domestic inventors and designers.
As for trademark, the establishment of the trademark system in the early 1980s
allowed Chinese companies to register their trademarks in use (Bosworth and Yang,
2000). Based on the above discussion, we can hypothesize that:

H4: Domestic applications for utility model, design and trademarks are more
favoured with grants than foreign applications, i.e.
H4a: Domestic applications for utility models are more favoured with grants than
foreign applications;
H4b: Domestic applications for industrial designs are more favoured with grants
than foreign applications; and
H4c: Domestic applications for trademarks are more favoured with grants than
foreign applications.

Methodology

The original data of this research are the WIPO statistics (1985–2003). WIPO
compiles IP statistics by year broken down by countries with the categories of

r  r 33

Deli Yang

Intellectual Property System in China

residents and non-residents applications and grants. According to Griliches (1990)
and Kotabe (1992), the WIPO IP statistics reﬂect technological activities across the
countries in the world with the most extensive applications by researchers. Never-
theless, the non-identiﬁcation of technological area and no reﬂection of technolo-
gical impact prevent researchers from conducting industrial analysis.

This study applies for the lagged regression model below adopted by Kotabe
(1992) to test the hypotheses. This model shows the response variable (patent
grants in a particular year associated with the applications in a lagged year (0–5
years)):

Yt ¼ at L þ bt L  Xt L þ et;

where Yt is the number of IP grants in year t, t the year of ﬁling an IP application,
at L the intercept for year t L, L the number of years lagged behind the applica-
tion for IP grant, b the IP grant in year t as a percentage of IP applications in year
t L, Xt L the number of IP applications and e the uncertainty of the pending
applications.

The association of the model with the hypotheses is established by R2 (H1 and
H2), slope coefﬁcient bt L (H3 and H4) and both t L and bt L (H2 and H4). For
Hypotheses 1 and 2 to be true, the e uncertainty should be low. In other words, the
highest R2 gives the best model for a particular year, thereby the common year with
IP lagged in grants. High R2 provides high certainty for an IP grant for that
particular year. For Hypotheses 3 and 4 to be true, bt L shows a higher value for the
hypothetically favoured applicants. If equal treatment is given, however, the bt L
should show a roughly equal value. By comparing t L and bt L, this research is
able to compare and contrast the results across different IP grants. The differences
in the lagged years will demonstrate the different extent of preferential treatment
towards different IP grants. Likewise, the comparison of bt L will show the gaps of
preferential treatment in grant ratios across different IP categories.

The analysis will follow the sequence as follows. First, some background data
will be discussed. These include descriptive information about the activities of
inventions, utility models, industrial designs and trademarks in China since the
1980s until 2002. These activities will also be graphically displayed using index data
to reﬂect the changes of IP activities across the four categories over the last two
decades or so. The main discussion will be on the IP activities in terms of grant lags
and ratios to respond to the hypotheses. Different IP will be analysed and discussed
ﬁrst before comparative analyses leading to answering the hypothetical questions
are conducted. In the process of analysing grant lags and ratios, the equality of the
correlation and slope coefﬁcients are tested with the following formulas due to the
independence of the samples. Equation (1) tests the equality of correlation (Bryant,
1966, pp. 140–2). The equality of slope coefﬁcients from two independent samples is
tested based on equation (2) (Cohen and Cohen, 2002, p. 111). When the p-value of
the result is signiﬁcant, it substantiates that the two samples generate signiﬁcantly

34

different results; otherwise, no signiﬁcant differences are detected between the two
samples.

Findings

Characteristics of IP Activities in China
The descriptive summary shown in Table 2 demonstrates similarities and differences
between domestic and foreign activities and across the four IP categories. A
dynamic stance was apparent for both domestic and foreign activities. This can
be observed by examining the mean values and the sum of IP in both applications
and grants. However, a close examination reveals the different extent of activities
across the IP categories. In particular, resident applications are much more dynamic
than non-resident applications for all the IP categories, except invention patents,
where the ratio is 1:3 in applications and 1:1.7 in grants. This demonstrates the
emphasis of foreign applicants on their core technologies. Other IP (utility model,
industrial design and marks) demonstrate a much higher level of domestic activities.
This is especially so for utility model activities, where the ratio for both applications
and grants between residents and non-residents is 146:1. This indicates that under
the IP policy in China, local inventors and creators are motivated to protect their
creativity of the minds and become competitive in the low technological ﬁeld.
Nevertheless, given the need for technological foundations, domestic invention
activities are not as sophisticated as foreign ones.

As for grant activities, there is also a difference between invention patent and
other IP activities. For invention patent, grants account for 16% of the total
applications for domestic inventors in comparison with 9% for foreign applications.
Therefore, according to the mean, domestic applicants are more favoured than
foreign applicants in invention patent activities. This also shows that, in recent
years, there has been great progress in domestic invention activities in China.
Nonetheless, a different picture is seen for the other three IP activities. Despite the
equal grant ratios for utility models between domestic and foreign applicants at

67%, the Chinese government grants more foreign applications for industrial
designs (84%) and trademarks (73%) in comparison with 72% and 63%, respec-
tively, for domestic applications. These results show that although domestic
applications are more dynamic in China, foreign applications are more favoured
by the Chinese government due probably to the high quality of the applications
(Bosworth and Yang, 2000) and the demand of the market (Sun, 2003). The
observation of minimum–maximum results shows that there is a large gap across
all the IP categories. This is particularly the case for invention patent grants. At the
early stage of the statistical records, there was only a small number of grants, but
there has been a surge in the activities over the years. This is a good indicator of the
dramatic changes of IP activities in China over the last two decades.

The evidence for such dramatic changes can be more clearly displayed in Figures
1–4. These ﬁgures compare and contrast the changes of IP activities over the years
since the 1980s. For inventions, non-resident grants have shown a sudden surge since
1998 showing the high inventive step of foreign technologies in China. Resident and
non-resident applications and resident grants show little difference over the years.
Utility model and industrial design activities show similar changes; both IP activities
show dramatic changes in the resident grants, although the utility model resident
grants show more ﬂuctuations. Both activities also show constant changes over the
years in applications and non-resident grants, with the changes increasing more in
recent years. In addition, non-resident applications in utility model activities show a

dramatic increase since 2001, demonstrating the dynamic atmosphere of the low level
of technological activities and government encouragement of such activities. Trade-
mark activities show the most ﬂuctuating changes over the years across both
applications and grants, but there has been an overall increasing trend since the
1990s. Both applications are increasing more dramatically than grants.

To summarize Figures 1–4, all the IP activities show an increasing trend,
particularly in recent years, but the different extent of development is also apparent
across the four IP rights. Comparatively, patent activities show a constant progress
over the years, except that NRG shows a dramatic surge in recent years. This
further demonstrates the emphasis of the Chinese-government to absorb advanced
foreign technologies. Both utility model and industrial design activities show a
similar structure of development over the years with a steadily increasing trend for
applications and grants, with the changes of resident grants being more dramatic in
recent years. Trademark activities show a different picture comparatively, as instead
of a greater increase in grants, as shown in all the patent activities, it shows a greater
increase in both local and foreign applications. Although it also shows overall
increasing trends like the patent activities, the changes are more ﬂuctuating since the
early 1990s, particularly for grants.

the grant lags and ratios in each category of IP, ﬁrst with a comparison between
residents and non-residents. Cross-IP discussion will follow to identify similarities
and differences in IP grant lags and ratios.

Grant Lags and Ratios Between Residents and Non-Residents

Invention Patents
The regression modelling of invention patents shows similar grant lags for domestic
and foreign applications. The ﬁt models for both applications are up to a 2-year lag
with a zero-year lag as the best model. In other words, invention patent applicants
in China are very likely to expect the application outcome within 2 years upon ﬁling
their applications. The certainty level for such grants is relatively high for both
domestic and foreign applications. For domestic applications, the R2 of the ﬁt
models explained at least 80% of the variations in grants, making the mean of
certainty at 84%. The best model of the zero-year grant lag model demonstrates
87% of the certainty for grants within the same year of ﬁling an invention patent.
For foreign applications, the R2s of the ﬁt models explained at least 65% of the
variations in grant lags, making the mean of certainty at 72%. The best model of
zero-year grant lag shows 79% of the certainty for grant within the same year of
ﬁling an invention patent.

The results suggest that domestic and foreign applications have the same grant
lags, but applicants bear different uncertainties, with domestic applicants being
advantaged with gaps of 8%, 13% and 15%, respectively, with foreign applicants.
The equality test of the correlation coefﬁcients for the two independent samples
shows that there is a signiﬁcant difference across the 0–2-year lags between domestic
and foreign grant lags (po0.001). This suggests that domestic applicants are more
likely to have the application outcomes than foreign applicants with the same
pending duration. As a result, as far as invention patent is concerned, Hypothesis
1a: ‘‘There is an equal grant lag for invention patents between domestic and foreign
applications in China’’ is supported, but some explanations need to be provided
with regard to uncertainty differences. Therefore, the justiﬁcation of the hypothesis
is: there is an equal grant lag of invention patent applications between domestic and
foreign applicants, but, comparatively, domestic applicants enjoy more certainty of
grants within the same pending period than foreign applicants.

As for grant ratios, the slope coefﬁcients for domestic and foreign applications
show wide gaps for the ﬁt models. The gaps between the two groups of applications
are 10%, 11% and 11%, respectively, for the 0–2-year lags. The equality test of the
slope coefﬁcients asserted such observations that the grants for domestic and
foreign applications are signiﬁcantly different across the ﬁt model grant lags
(po0.001). This ﬁnding suggests that domestic applicants are favoured more than
foreign applicants in terms of patent grants. The result therefore reverses Hypoth-
esis 3: foreign invention patent applications are more favoured with grants than
domestic patent applications.

Utility Model Patents
The lagged regressions of utility model patents show similar grant lags between
domestic and foreign applications. The ﬁt models for domestic applications are
0–2-year lags with 1-year lag as the best model. In other words, domestic applicants
for utility models can expect an application outcome within 2 years upon ﬁling. The
certainty level for both applications is high at above 80%. The certainty level for
grants within the lagged years explained at least 83% of the variations in grants,
making the mean of the ﬁt models at 86%. The best model demonstrates 88% of the
certainty for grant to be expected within 1 year upon ﬁling. For foreign applica-
tions, the grant lags can be zero or 1 year, explaining at least 83% of the variations,
making the mean of certainty at 83.5%. The best model shows 84% of the certainty
for grant within 1 year upon ﬁling a utility model patent. As a result, both domestic
and foreign applications have the best model of 1-year grant lag. However, foreign
applications have up to a 1-year lag in comparison with up to a 2-year lag in
domestic applications. The equality test of the correlation coefﬁcients for the two
independent samples shows that there is a signiﬁcant difference across the 0–2 year
lags between domestic and foreign applications (po0.001). This suggests that
foreign applicants have a better chance to have their applications processed within
1 year upon ﬁling, and domestic applications have the same certainty, but the
outcome of applications is also very likely to be approved at the second year of
applications. To conclude, Hypothesis 1b: ‘‘There is an equal grant lag between
domestic and foreign application for utility model in China’’ is supported. However,
some further explanations need to be given with regard to the spread of grant lags.
Therefore, the justiﬁcation of the hypothesis is: there is almost an equal grant lag of
utility model applications for domestic and foreign applicants, but, comparatively,
foreign applicants are more likely to have grants within 1 year upon ﬁling for which
domestic applications may have 2 years.

As for grant ratios, the slope coefﬁcients for both applications show wide gaps
for the 0–1-year lags at 30% and 17%, respectively, between domestic and foreign
applications. The slope test demonstrates that domestic and foreign applications are
signiﬁcantly different for the same period (po0.09 at least), but the test for 2- and
3-year lags demonstrates no difference (p value at 0.72 at least). The ﬁnding suggests
that domestic applicants are highly favoured for grants during the lag years. The
result therefore supports Hypothesis 4a: Domestic applications for utility models
are more favoured with grants than foreign applications.

Industrial Design Patents
The lagged regressions of industrial designs show that both domestic and foreign
applications have the best model of 1-year lag. Both applications enjoy a high
certainty at 99% (domestic applications) and 97% (foreign applications), respec-
tively, for the best model. The ﬁt models, however, show up to 5-year lags for
domestic applications in comparison with a 2-year lag for foreign applications. The

42

r  r Intellectual Property System in China

Deli Yang

R2 of the ﬁt models for domestic applications explained at least 96% of the
variations in grants, yielding a high mean of 98%. However, the spread is across
all the 5-year period indicating that the grant can be within any one of the ﬁve
lagged years, including zero-year lag. Like the utility model, such a wide spread is
probably due to the much larger number of domestic applications.

For foreign applications, the grant lags can be from zero- to 2-year lags with the
certainty level slightly lower than domestic applications. The best model explained
over 97% of the variations in grant, yielding a high mean across the 3 years at 96%.
The equality test of the correlation coefﬁcients for the two independent samples
shows that there is a signiﬁcant difference across the 0–3 year lags between the two
groups of applications (po0.0000). The results show that foreign applicants have
better opportunities to have their grants within 2 years upon ﬁling than domestic
applications, which may expect a grant within from 1 to 5 years. As a result, as far
as industrial design is concerned, Hypothesis 1c: ‘‘There is an equal grant lag
between domestic and foreign application for industrial designs in China’’ is only
partly supported. The justiﬁcation is that there is an almost equal grant lag for both
applications, but, comparatively, foreign applicants are more likely to have grants
within 2 years upon ﬁling for which domestic applications may have to wait up to
5 years depending on the applications.

As for grant ratios of industrial designs, the slope coefﬁcients for domestic and
foreign applications show small gaps, with foreign applications slightly favoured. This
is particularly the case for the ﬁrst 3 years where foreign applications display the ﬁt
models. On average, the slope coefﬁcient for domestic grants is 0.9517 in comparison
with 1.025 for foreign grants with a gap of 0.074. The equality test of the slope
coefﬁcients demonstrates that domestic and foreign applications are signiﬁcantly
different for the 1-year lag, with foreign applications favoured (po0.038) between
domestic and foreign grant lags. As a result of the ﬁndings, foreign applicants are
more favoured than domestic applicants. Nonetheless, although there is a wide spread
of grant lags for domestic applications, the grant ratios increase with the growing
number of years in grant lags. The ﬁndings deny Hypothesis 4b: ‘‘Domestic applica-
tions for industrial design are more favoured with grants than foreign applications’’.
The adjustment is therefore: foreign applications are overall more favoured with
grants than domestic applications in the ﬁrst 3 years of applications.

Trademarks
The lagged regression of trademarks shows that both foreign and domestic
applications have the best model of a 2-year lag, with domestic lag showing a
slightly higher level of certainty. The ﬁt models for domestic applications show
that an application is very likely to have a pending period between zero and 4
years. The best model shows 88% of certainty, explaining the variations in grant
lags. For foreign applications, the grant lags could be up to 2 years where the 2-
year lag displays the best model with a certainty level at 83%. The equality test of

r  r 43

Deli Yang

Intellectual Property System in China

the correlation coefﬁcients for the two independent samples shows that their
difference only becomes different from the second year of grant lag (po0.001 at
least). The results show that despite the best model of a 2-year lag for both
application groups, foreign applicants would have better opportunities to be
granted a trademark due to the shorter spread of grant lags than domestic
applications. As a result, Hypothesis 1d: ‘‘There is an equal grant lag for trade-
marks between domestic and foreign applications in China’’
is only partly
supported. This is because both groups show the 2-year lag model as the best.
Nevertheless, the spread of grant lags for domestic applications is wider than
foreign applications. In the meantime, although domestic applicants have higher
certainties for grants across the 4 years, the applications may have grants in the
third or fourth year where the certainty level of grants exceeds over 73%.
Therefore, the justiﬁcation of the hypothesis is that there is almost an equal grant
lag between domestic and foreign applications for trademarks in China with
similar certainties on average (80% versus 81%), but, comparatively, foreign
applicants have a narrower spread of grant lags of up to 2 years against up to 4
years for domestic applications after ﬁling their applications.

As

ratios,

for grant

the slope coefﬁcients

for domestic and foreign
applications show large gaps. For the best models, domestic grants have a gap
with foreign grants at 0.224. Within the ﬁt models, foreign applications are
favoured in the zero and ﬁrst year, but with the increase of grant lag years,
domestic applications are more favoured and the gap of grant ratios between the
two groups also increases. In addition, on average, the grant ratios for domestic
applications are much higher than foreign applications (0.98:0.79). The slope test
demonstrates that domestic and foreign applications are not signiﬁcantly different
until the third year between domestic and foreign grant lags (p412 at least).
Therefore, the ﬁndings deny Hypothesis 4c: ‘‘Domestic applications for trade-
marks are more favoured with grants than foreign applications’’. The adjustment
is therefore: domestic applications and foreign applications for trademarks are
treated almost equally.

Cross-IP Comparison

Grant Lags
The lagged regression models in Table 3 also display similarities and differences
across different IP categories in terms of grant lags. One similarity across the
four IP rights is the surprisingly equal grant lags between domestic and foreign
applications when the best models are compared, although different lag years
were shown. However, within such a similarity, differences exist. Invention
patent shows the most balanced grant lags where a grant can be expected within
2 years upon ﬁling for both groups of applicants. Utility models and industrial
designs show the same grant lags of the best models, but the spread of grant lagged
years tends to be longer for domestic applicants. Trademarks are mostly approved

44

r  r Intellectual Property System in China

and registered within 2 years of the applications, showing the longest lag among
the IP rights based on the best models. Like utility model and industrial design,
domestic applications have a wider spread of grant lags. The second similarity
across the four IP rights is that domestic applications all show higher certainty
levels than foreign applications, although both groups of applications have
high certainties. Industrial designs (best model) show little gap of certainty
between domestic and foreign applications (2%). Meanwhile, utility models and
trademarks show a gap of up to 5%. The largest gap is reﬂected in the patent grant
lags at 8%.

The above discussions allow us to respond to Hypotheses 1 and 2. Hypothesis 1
is supported,
i.e. there is an equal grant lag between domestic and foreign
applications for IP rights in China. In addition, both groups of applicants enjoy
a high certainty of IP grants. Nevertheless, across the different IP categories,
domestic applicants appear to enjoy a higher certainty of grant lags than foreign
applicants, with the largest gap occurring in invention patent applications. For non-
invention IP, foreign applications enjoy a shorter lag spread than domestic
applicants. The research result denies Hypothesis 2 and concludes that it does
not necessarily take a longer time to have invention patent grants than other IP
grants according to the ﬁt models, but it appears that invention patents take even
shorter time for grants according to the best models. Comparatively, industrial
design shows the most consistent certainty between domestic and foreign applica-
tions, and the highest certainty across the four IP rights with utility models and
trademarks falling behind. Invention patent applications show the lowest certainty
and the highest gap between domestic and foreign applications, with foreign
invention patents having the lowest certainty at 79%. This indicates that although
equal treatment is given, foreign applicants endure a high uncertainty of grant lags
than domestic applicants.

As for grant ratios, domestic and foreign applications across the four IP rights
have more differences than similarities. The similarity that this research has observed
is that the invention and utility model demonstrate high slope coefﬁcients for domestic
applications, with a gap of invention applications at 10% and utility models at 17%.
The industrial design model shows that foreign applications are favoured, with an
11% gap between the two categories of applications. Trademark grants are treated
almost equally for domestic and foreign applications in the ﬁrst three grant lagged
years. On the basis of the above discussions, we can conclude that China provides
preferential treatment to domestic applications for inventions and utility models, but
not for industrial designs. In the meantime, trademarks are treated almost equally
with grants. Therefore, Hypothesis 3: ‘‘Foreign invention patent applications are
more favoured with grants than domestic applications’’ should be reversed. Hypoth-
esis 4: ‘‘Domestic applications for utility models, industrial designs and trademarks
are more favoured with grants than foreign applications’’ is only partly supported to
exclude the case for industrial designs for which foreign applications are favoured and
for trademarks for which equal treatments were provided.

Discussions and Conclusions

Results and Discussions
This article has examined the IPS in China applying lagged regression analysis with
IP data from 1985 to 2002. A particular focus of this study was on the grant lags
and ratios of four major IP activities—invention patents, utility models, industrial
designs and trademarks between residents and non-residents. The ﬁndings respond
to four main hypotheses associated with grant lags and ratios. Hypothesis 1 was
supported in that domestic and foreign applications tend to have equal grant lags
across all the IP rights in China. Within the equality, invention patents enjoy the
most balanced lags, as most applications are able to expect grants within 2 years
and very likely in the same year of ﬁling. Trademarks have the longest grant lag of
2 years, based on the best model for both groups of applications, while utility
models and industrial designs take 1 year, mostly for grants. However, the spread of
lagged years tends to be much wider for non-invention IP rights, particularly for
industrial designs and trademarks due to the much larger amounts of domestic
applications than foreign applications. As a consequence, the ﬁndings deny
Hypothesis 2 and conclude that it does not necessarily take a longer time to have
invention patent grants than other IP rights. The results reverse Hypothesis 3 and
conclude that domestic invention patent applications are more favoured than
foreign invention patents with grants. The ﬁndings also only partly support
Hypothesis 4 and conclude that domestic utility models are more favoured for
grants. By contrast, industrial designs are highly favoured towards foreign appli-
cants, and trademarks are almost treated equally.

The research ﬁndings bear resemblance to previous research and also show
differences in grant lags and ratios. Hypothesis 1 conﬁrmed previous research that
foreign applications take no longer than domestic applications for grants (Popp
et al., 2003) and allowed comparison between developed and developing countries
in terms of grant lags. In comparison with the United States, Japan, Germany and
United Kingdom studied by Kotabe (1992), the ﬁndings in this research demon-
strate that China has a much more balanced treatment towards domestic and
foreign patent applications as far as the grant lags are concerned. Like the United
States, United Kingdom, and Germany, invention patents are usually granted with
similar grant lags and can be expected as an outcome even in the same year upon
ﬁling. What differs from the countries previously studied is that China shows a
much higher certainty than Japan, the United States (domestic applications only),
Germany and the United Kingdom. This demonstrates that the Chinese system, as
far as the grant lags are concerned, has reached a development level in parallel to
the major developed countries.

The response about Hypothesis 2 indicates that the extent of grant lags is country
bound. Previous studies about the United States (Popp et al., 2003) and China (Sun,
2003) concluded that complexity increases grant lags, but there is no conﬁrmation
from these research ﬁndings. This is because the best models show that trademarks,

46

r  r Intellectual Property System in China

Deli Yang

utility models and industrial designs, while less complex in terms of technology and
examination procedures, may take a longer time for approval than invention patents,
particularly as far as the domestic applications are concerned.

The new ﬁndings also allow comparison with previous research about grant
ratios among the countries studied. Chinese grants to domestic applications have
grant ratios similar to Japanese grants, but much lower grant ratios than the other
developed countries studied. Different from Japan with equal grant ratios, China
joined the United Kingdom, United States and Germany, and became a biased
country towards domestic applicants in terms of grant ratios. Such ﬁndings deny the
conclusion of Bosworth and Yang (2000) that there were more foreign grants. The
reason why different conclusions were drawn was the time framework, with
previous studies using data from 1985 to 1995. Since 1995, circumstances have
changed with the patent grants. According to the data analysis of patents (WIPO,
1981–2002), pre-1995 grant ratios for domestic and foreign applications are 15%
and 17%, respectively, in comparison with 16% and 7.5% post-1996. This indicates
that,
in recent years, the Chinese government has placed more emphasis on
domestic applications. This also indicates the progress of domestic technologies
with the inﬂuence of global technologies. In parallel, it is also a sign of biases
towards domestic applications over foreign applications. The response to Hypoth-
esis 4 in this research partly conﬁrmed previous research by Bosworth and Yang
(2000) that lower levels of technologies tend to be dominated by domestic applicants
in both applications and grants. This is because utility models show much higher
grants for domestic applicants in parallel to invention patents, although foreign
applicants show almost equal grants for trademarks, but a more dynamic stance in
industrial design activities.

To summarize the above discussions, the ﬁndings from this research have added
to our knowledge on this subject. Previous research concentrated on patent studies
in terms of grant lags and grant ratios, but little attention has been given to other IP
activities. Empirical studies focused on developed countries, but little attention was
paid to developing countries. This study, using the lagged regression analysis, has
added other major IP—utility models,
industrial designs and trademarks—to
knowledge in this specialized ﬁeld in the context of the Chinese setting. The ﬁndings
demonstrate that China has made tremendous progress in developing itself into an
IPS in parallel to the major developed countries and in conformity to international
standards. As far as grant lags are concerned, China has probably bypassed some
developed countries and succeeded in striking a balance between domestic and
foreign applications. However, no perfect systems exist, and there is certainly no
exception to this for the young Chinese system, which will be discussed in the
subsequent sections.

Implications for Policy Makers and Innovators
The following policy implications are drawn from this research. First, China needs
to improve its IPS towards a fairer treatment in grant ratios between domestic and

r  r 47

Deli Yang

Intellectual Property System in China

foreign applications. This is reﬂected in the fact that domestic applicants are biased
against foreign applications in grant ratios of inventions and utility models, while
foreign applicants are preferentially treated over domestic applicants in grant ratios
of industrial designs. It is important to narrow the gaps of grant ratios because
China needs to encourage inventors and creators from both home and abroad to
contribute to its economic development with their continual innovative activities.
Any imbalance from one group to another would undermine incentives for
creativity in China. Second, China also needs to be cautious about maintaining a
good certainty of grant lags. Although the government has maintained a high level
of certainty in granting an IP in certain periods of time, further improvement of
such certainties would increase the interests for IP activities in China domestically
and internationally because high certainties boost the conﬁdence of inventors and
creators in the government protecting creativity. Third, for domestic applications of
non-invention IP, shortening the lagged years would bring beneﬁts for the appli-
cants. One way to do so may be to enlarge the examination team for domestic
applications.

The research ﬁndings also provide implications for inventors and other IP
creators. First, applicants should ﬁnd out the main barriers for grant lags,
particularly the uncertainty factors that cause grant lags and explore the probability
of resolving this matter. Second, applicants must ensure that their IP will be in an
advantageous position for ﬁling and grants. They need to conduct such an analysis
because each country is biased in its way towards either domestic or foreign
applications, with domestic applications being more likely favoured. For foreign
applicants in China, it is important to conduct such an assurance study to guarantee
that the technology or design has not been ﬁled or patented and it will be highly
receptive to the Chinese circumstances. This is because China has become an
increasingly competitive environment for IP activities and favouritism also exists, as
in other countries, mainly towards domestic applicants.

Directions for Policy Research
This research shows its limitations, which necessitate the need for further research.
First, it is necessary to enrich knowledge in this research ﬁeld. This is a piece of
quantitative research examining the status of grant lags and grant ratios. Therefore,
the ‘‘what’’ factor has been explored, but it is dubious whether government
administration is the only factor resulting in the different extent of grant lags
across the four IP rights and wide gaps of grant ratios between domestic and foreign
applications. The dubious results cannot be clariﬁed on the basis of existing
statistical data. Second, as mentioned earlier, the empirical contribution in this
research ﬁeld is scarce, and further additions, particularly developing countries, to
such research would increase empirical contribution and the level of comparative
studies. Third, qualitative study-based research, such as case studies and interview
data analysis, would methodologically contribute knowledge to this research and

previous studies. This is because such input will triangulate the existing studies to
greater theoretical and empirical depths.
