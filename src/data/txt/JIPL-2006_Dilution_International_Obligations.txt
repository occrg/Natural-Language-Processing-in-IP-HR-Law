Dilution in the US, Europe, and beyond:
international obligations and basic definitions
Ilanah Simon*

1. Introduction
This is the Ô¨Årst of two articles on trade mark dilution.
It compares the protection against dilution1 offered
in the United States and the European Union, asks
what the jurisdictions have to learn from each other
and questions whether the two regimes meet the
trade mark obligations under international law. The
way in which blurring is tested will receive particular
attention in a subsequent article, being one ‚Äòmicro‚Äô
example in which the many detailed similarities
between the dilution provisions of the two jurisdic-
tions can be examined.

With regard to the US law, the focus will be on the
Trademark Dilution Revision Act 2005, and on
the EU side particular attention will be paid to the
jurisprudence of
Justice,
OHIM (the body responsible for administering the
Community trade mark) and the UK.

First though, it is necessary to identify what inter-
national law requires in the way of protection for
well-known marks.

2. Dilution protection under
international law
The Paris Convention

Key issues
 Dilution of an earlier trade mark through the
exploitation of a later one is a concept that is
well known in United States federal and state
law, though it has an analogue in the protec-
tion accorded to marks with reputations in
the European Union too.

 In addition to the development of dilution
doctrine in the United States and in Europe,
the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) has been active in recommending how
dilutionary issues should be tackled; WIPO‚Äôs
constituency is however a wider one, including
emerging markets in which both consumer
and commercial responses to the threat of
dilution may be different.

 The evolution and scope of protection against
dilution in the United States is somewhat
different from that in Europe. This article
considers current proposals for reform in the
United States and considers what lessons the
United States experience has for Europe.

Bespoke protection for well-known trade marks Ô¨Årst
appeared in Article 6bis of the Paris Convention.
However, the protection envisaged by that article
rests on a traditional confusion-based conception
of infringement, since it calls upon the countries
of the Paris Union to refuse to register, prohibit
the use of, or to cancel a later mark which creates

confusion with the earlier well-known mark. More-
over, its protection is limited to situations in which
the later use is on goods which are identical or similar
to those for which the earlier mark is well-known.
Instead,
is that
protection is afforded to marks that are well-known
in a particular jurisdiction, even when they have

1 Though there is little consensus on the precise meaning of dilution it is
widely acknowledged that there are at least two types: dilution by blurring
(harm to the distinctiveness of the earlier mark, possibly to the extent
that its ability to act a trade mark for its owner‚Äôs goods is impaired) and
dilution by tarnishment (damage to the image of the mark by associating
it with unsavoury or low-quality goods). See McCarthy, McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition, ss 24.67‚Äì24.70.

registered in that

Thus the Paris Convention imports no obligation
to provide dilution protection. Instead,
it merely
extends traditional trade mark protection to well-
known but unregistered marks.

TRIPs

The TRIPs Agreement, by which all members of the
WTO are bound, provides protection that is a little
closer to what we understand by dilution protection.
Under Article 16(3), TRIPs extends Article 6bis of
the Paris Convention so that it applies to later use
on goods which are dissimilar to those for which the
earlier mark is well-known. This brings international
trade mark law closer to the conventional view of
dilution, which has focused on use of the later marks
on goods which are dissimilar to those on which the
earlier mark has been used or registered for.3

The type of harm to the earlier well-known mark

called for in Article 16(3) is that

use of that trademark in relation to those goods or
services would indicate a connection between those
goods or services and the owner of the registered
trademark and provided that the interests of the owner
of the registered trademark are likely to be damaged by
such use [emphasis added]

goods or services and the owner of the earlier mark.
This is more like traditional confusion (where con-
sumers believe that the later goods were made by or
under the authority of the earlier user) than the
type of connection between the two parties‚Äô marks
that is necessary for dilution to occur. Furthermore,
Article 16(3) provides these words as an explanation
of how Article 6bis Paris can apply to a dissimilar
goods situation. Ultimately though, its purpose is to
apply Article 6bis and Article 6bis is an expression
of
traditional, confusion-based infringement and,
contrary to the comments of Daniel Gervais,4 Article
16(3) does not provide dilution protection per se.

Article 16(2) of TRIPs provides further clariÔ¨Åcation
on various aspects of well-known mark protection,
but does not add anything on the subject of the type
of protection that is offered.5

The TRIPs Agreement merely sets down the min-
imum standards for the protection of
intellectual
property that WTO members must provide.6 There
is nothing to prevent its signatories from providing
greater protection than that laid down in TRIPs; so,
while TRIPs does not oblige members to provide
dilution protection, it does not prevent them from
doing so.

The Joint Recommendation

might suggest a form of protection that is more akin
to dilution, since the word ‚Äòconnection‚Äô
is used,
rather than ‚Äòconfusion‚Äô. As will be seen in Part II of
this article, the term ‚Äòconnection‚Äô and its close cousin
‚Äòassociation‚Äô play a crucial role in dilution law in both
the US and the EU. However, the form of ‚Äòconnec-
tion‚Äô called for in Article 16(3) is between the later

While there is no ‚Äòhard‚Äô international law mandating
dilution protection, there is ‚Äòsoft law‚Äô to this effect.
The WIPO Standing Committee on the Law of Trade-
marks, Industrial Designs and Geographical Indica-
tions (SCT) has adopted a Joint Recommendation
Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-
Known Marks.7 The recommendation is not binding.8

2

See Bodenhausen, Guide to the Application of the Paris Convention for the
Protection of Industrial Property (BIRPI, 1969, reprinted WIPO, Geneva,
1991) pp 90‚Äì91. The nature of dilution protection under international
law has also been discussed by S Chong, ‚ÄòProtection of Famous Trade-
marks Against Use for Unrelated Goods and Services: A Comparative
Analysis of the Law in the United States, the United Kingdom and
Canada and Recommendations for Canadian Law Reform‚Äô (2005) 95
TMR 642, 644‚Äì652.

3 This has always been the conventional reading of Frank Schechter‚Äôs classic
article on dilution, ‚ÄòThe Rational Basis of Trademark Protection‚Äô 40 Harv L
Rev 813 (1926‚Äì1927).

4 D Gervais, The TRIPs Agreement: Drafting History and Analysis (London:
Sweet & Maxwell, 2003), 174 argues that art 16(3) does protect against
the dilution of a trade mark and that the reference to art 6bis is an
alternative to the connection plus injury use identified in the article.
A close reading of the article however shows that connection plus injury
qualifies the reference to art 6bis, so that, on a literal interpretation, both
the confusion identified in art 6bis and the connection plus injury

elements are required. He adds that the intention was to replace the
requirements of art 6bis with a ‚Äòdouble test of connection and likely
damage‚Äô. However, the reference to art 6bis remains and thus imports
the notion of confusion into TRIPs well-known mark protection.
Moreover, as is argued here, the connection identified in art 16(3) is not
of the sort that would amount to dilution.

5 Art 16(2) expands art 6bis Paris to encompass service marks, as well as
trade marks, and provides guidance as to the relevant public when
assessing whether a mark is well-known.

8 However, as Graeme Dinwoodie points out in ‚ÄòTrademarks and Territory:
Detaching Trademark Law from the Nation State‚Äô (2004) 41 Houston Law
Rev 885, 924, the US may have caused itself to be bound by the Joint
Recommendations. The United States has entered into a number of
bilateral agreements which include a clause requiring both parties to
meet the standards of the Joint Recommendations.

Instead, it takes the form of a recommendation to
the members of the Paris Union that they consider
using the provisions contained therein as guidelines
for well-known mark protection and bring the
recommendation to the notice of any intergovern-
mental organization with trade mark competence of
which they are a part.9

In Article 2, the Recommendation provides an
expansive deÔ¨Ånition of when a mark can be con-
sidered to be well-known.

Article 3 forms the ‚Äòoperative‚Äô part of the Recom-
mendation, in that it contains the recommendation
that members should provide protection for well-
known marks against ‚ÄòconÔ¨Çicting‚Äô marks, business
identiÔ¨Åers, and domain names. It is in the deÔ¨Ånition
of what constitutes a ‚ÄòconÔ¨Çicting‚Äô mark that dilution
protection comes into play.
This deÔ¨Ånition can be

found in Article 4.
Traditional confusion-based infringement, where the
later mark is used on identical or similar goods, can
be found here,10 but so can dilution protection.
Article 4(1)(b) offers three situations where, irrespec-
tive of the goods on which the later mark is used,
the later mark can be considered to be conÔ¨Çicting.

First, where

the use of that mark would indicate a connection
between the goods and/or services for which the
mark is used,
is the subject of an application for
registration, or is registered, and the owner of the
well-known mark, and would be likely to damage his
interests.

This is virtually identical to the protection afforded
by Article 16(3) of TRIPs, except for the absence of
the reference back to Article 6bis of Paris.

Secondly, where

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2006, Vol. 1, No. 6

of the distinctive character of a well-known mark is
also introduced, but there is no explanation as to
how this differs from dilution.

Finally, where

the use of that mark would take unfair advantage of
the distinctive character of the well-known mark.

This provision goes further than even traditional
dilution protection, calling for protection against the
misappropriation of the distinctive character of the
earlier well-known mark.

Similar provisions are recommended where the
conÔ¨Çict is between a well-known mark and a later
business
recom-
mendations are made where the conÔ¨Çict is with a
later domain name.12

identiÔ¨Åer.11 Even less

stringent

The Recommendation certainly envisages

the
granting of protection against dilution against uses
on both similar and dissimilar later goods. However,
it does not tell the members what form this pro-
tection should take. It is notable that there is no
mention of protecting the reputation of the earlier
well-known mark. This means that tarnishment does
not appear to be within the scope of the Recom-
mendation. Also, the type of unfair advantage identi-
Ô¨Åed is unfair advantage of the distinctiveness of the
earlier mark, rather than of
its reputation, even
though it is easier to see how a later user might be
able to make use of an earlier mark‚Äôs reputation,
rather than the distinctiveness of the earlier mark. It
is signiÔ¨Åcant that dilution is mentioned in addition
to the type of harm that is mentioned in Article 16(3)
of TRIPs, suggesting that Article 16(3) does not pro-
vide any form of dilution protection: if it did, the sep-
arate mention of dilution in the Recommendation
would be unnecessary.

the use of that mark is likely to impair or dilute in
an unfair manner the distinctive character of
the
well-known mark.

In Summary

Here protection against dilution is expressly men-
tioned, although there is no attempt to explain what
exactly it takes to dilute the distinctive character of
a well-known mark. The concept of the impairment

There is no international obligation to grant dilution
protection to the owners of well-known marks.
Instead, the obligation is limited to the provision of
protection from confusion caused by later use on

‚Äòsoft law‚Äô that recommends both dilution and misap-
propriation protection against the use of marks and
business identiÔ¨Åers on both identical and similar
and dissimilar later goods and services.

3. The legal framework
in the United States
The FTDA and the need for revision

Protection against dilution Ô¨Årst became part of
federal trade mark law in 1995. Previously, dilution
protection had been available under state law in a
locations.13 The Federal Trademark
number of
Dilution Act 1995 (FTDA) made this protection
nationwide by introducing a new section 43(c) into
the Lanham Act. This provision provides,

The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject
to the principles of equity and upon such terms as
the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against
another person‚Äôs commercial use in commerce of a
mark or trade name,
if such use begins after the
mark has become famous and causes dilution of the
distinctive quality of the mark, and to obtain such
other relief as is provided in this subsection.

The harm that is identiÔ¨Åed is the dilution of the
distinctive quality of another person‚Äôs mark. The
protection is limited to famous marks, instructions
on how to test for fame being laid out in a non-
exhaustive multi-factor test that forms part of the
subsection. A number of defences are also set out in
the subsection.

The FTDA also amended section 45 of the Lanham
Act to introduce a deÔ¨Ånition of the term ‚Äòdilution‚Äô.
This states that

The term ‚Äòdilution‚Äô means the lessening of the capacity
of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or
services, regardless of the presence or absence of

(1) competition between the owner of the famous

mark and other parties, or

(2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.

13 Anti-dilution law remains statute law in numerous states. In fact, there was
some talk of it regaining its usefulness in the wake of the Victoria‚Äôs Secret
to require actual
litigation since state anti-dilution laws

The meaning and scope of much of the FTDA is
controversial. In particular, the following questions
have arisen:

(i) Which earlier marks are granted protection?
Clearly, a mark must be famous to be protected,
but the FTDA introduces a degree of ambiguity
by describing the test
for fame as being to
determine whether a mark is ‚Äòdistinctive and
famous‚Äô. This has led some courts to find that a
mark be not only famous
to be protected,
but also inherently distinctive.14

(ii) What

is needed to prove dilution? While a
definition of dilution is provided, this is largely
in the negative,
informing undertakings that
confusion and competition between the parties
is not required. Section 43(c) does suggest that,
in order to fall within the definition of dilution,
the later use must impair the distinctiveness of
the earlier mark. Also, the section 45 definition
does make it clear that the ability of the earlier
mark to act as a trade mark, ie to identify and
distinguish the goods of its owner, must be dam-
aged. However, the FTDA provides no guidance
on how to identify when such harm has taken
place.

(iii) Section 45 states that dilution can take place
‚Äòirrespective‚Äô of whether the parties‚Äô goods or
services are in competition with each other.
However, because historically dilution developed
as a remedy where goods are dissimilar, some
courts have resisted the notion that federal dilu-
tion protection applies to both non-competing
and identical and similar goods situations.15

(iv) Likewise, section 45 states that dilution applies
without regard to the presence of confusion.
This too has met with judicial resistance16 since
dilution has
traditionally been seen as an
alternative
confusion-based
infringement.

dilution‚Äô. Read literally this suggests that,
order for the famous mark-owner to obtain relief,
the dilution of his mark must already have taken
place, ie there must be ‚Äòactual dilution‚Äô. There
are two main difficulties with this proposition.
First, considering the fact that the definition of
dilution is unclear, it is difficult to show that
such dilution has actually taken place. Second,
by the time dilution has taken place, the harm
to the earlier mark has already been done. It has
therefore been argued that earlier mark-owners
should be given the opportunity to prevent dilu-
tion from occurring once the ‚Äòdanger signs‚Äô
which are indicative of
likely dilution are in
place, rather than having to stand by and watch
while their marks are irreparably harmed. The
issue of likely dilution culminated in a decision
of the Supreme Court, which found that actual
dilution was the relevant standard.17

(vi) No mention was made of dilution by tarnish-
ment or damage to the reputation of the earlier
mark.18

This protection was expanded to enable the owners

1999.

bill, the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006,19
was passed by the House of Representatives
in
April 2005 and was passed by the Senate in March
2006.

The Revision Act completely overhauls the scheme
for federal dilution, substituting a fresh section 43(c)20
and introducing conforming amendments to imple-
ment the same changes with regard to registration,
and cancellation.21 The
opposition,
section 45
deÔ¨Ånition of dilution is also removed.22

The Revision Act makes it clear that where either
dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of a
famous mark takes place injunctive relief will be
available. This is so whether there is (i) confusion,
(ii) competition, or (iii) actual economic injury.23 It
takes a relatively narrow approach to what constitutes
a famous mark, with the requirement that it must be
widely recognized by the general consuming public.
In other words, fame in a niche area of commerce
will not sufÔ¨Åce.24

Most importantly for our purposes, dilution by
blurring is deÔ¨Åned and a non-exclusive multi-factor
test for dilution by blurring is set out. This is dis-
cussed in further detail in Part II of this article.25
Dilution by tarnishment is also deÔ¨Åned.26 Further-
more, a number of defences to dilution are laid
out,27 together with a revised remedies system.28
There is a new burden of proof in trade dress cases.
Finally, the clause that causes ownership of a valid
registration to be a complete bar
to action is
re-enacted.29

These articles will focus primarily on the impact of
the Revision Act and how it compares to European
anti-dilution provisions,
though references to the
earlier law will be made where helpful.

pieces of legislation involved. In a nutshell,

successful claim:

(i) The European Union Directive 89/104,30 the
document that harmonizes the trade mark law
of the EU Member States, was adopted at the
EU level, although individuals could only rely
on its provisions once it was implemented into
the national
laws of the Member States. The
judicial body of the EU, the European Court of
Justice (ECJ), provides guidance to the Member
States as to the correct interpretation of the
Directive, and hears appeals
from decisions
of OHIM.

89/104

into their national

(ii) The Member States were obliged to implement
Directive
laws,
although the form in which they did so was at
their discretion. The Members are now respons-
ible for the day-to-day running of their trade
mark laws, although, where a problem of inter-
pretation arises for which the solution is unclear,
the court of final resort31 of that state must refer
the issue in the form of a question to the ECJ.32
(iii) The Office for Harmonisation in the Internal
Market (OHIM) is charged with the administra-
tion of
the Community trade mark (CTM).
This is a unitary right that gives the holder of a
CTM a single right which covers every state of
the EU. The way in which the CTM system
operates is set out in Regulation 40/94,33 which,
to a large extent, mirrors Directive 89/104.
In order to appreciate EU jurisprudence,
it
should be understood that OHIM has an internal
appeal body, the Boards of Appeal; upon the
conclusion of Board of Appeal proceedings,
parties may appeal to the ECJ. Initially the appeal
is to the Court of First Instance, which is an
independent court attached to the ECJ but,
should the parties desire it, a further appeal to
the ECJ proper (on points of law only) can be
made.

Directive 89/104 and Regulation 40/94 have almost
identical anti-dilution provisions. In essence, both
identify the following components as required for a

(i) the earlier mark must have a reputation;

(ii) the later mark must be identical with, or similar

to, the earlier trade mark;

(iii) the use of the later mark must (a) cause detri-
ment to the distinctive character of the earlier
mark, (b) cause detriment
to the reputation
of the earlier mark, (c) take unfair advantage of
the distinctive character of the earlier mark, or
(d) take unfair advantage of the reputation of
the earlier mark; and

(iv) the use of the later mark must be without due

cause.

Such provisions exist both with regard to opposing
the use of a later mark34 and opposing the registra-
tion of a later mark that, if used, would have the
effect described in (iii).35 Such provisions also apply
to cancellation of an invalid mark.36

Member States had the option of not adopting
anti-dilution protection when implementing the
Directive, but all chose to do so. Now that they
have, although they have the choice of form that the
protection takes, they are obliged to interpret the
law that they have in a way that meets the require-
ments of Directive 89/104 set out above.

5. Comparing dilution
in the EU and US: the big picture
From the discussion above, it should be obvious that,
while the wording is different, a number of the basic
requirements for successfully showing dilution in the
two jurisdictions are very similar. This can be most
easily seen when the proposition is demonstrated in
tabular form. For ease of reference, the Joint Recom-
mendation requirements are set out in Table 1.

6. Conclusion
Although there is not 100% parity between the laws
of the two jurisdictions, the similarities are certainly
signiÔ¨Åcant. Moreover, if one looks in detail at the
way in which these requirements have been treated by

30 First Council Directive 89/104 to approximate the laws of the Member

States relating to trade marks.

31 Lower courts are also able to, but are not obliged to, make art 234

references.

RECOMMENDATION

Fame of the

Similarity between
the marks

Identical/similar earlier
and later marks

Type of injury I

Type of injury II

Type of injury III

Use that causes detriment to

Type of injury IV

Use that takes unfair

Earlier famous mark

Earlier well-known mark

This was not stated to be a
prerequisite under the FTDA
but a number of cases have
stressed its importance.
Under the Revision Act
blurring is defined as ‚Äòarising
from the similarity between a
mark or trade name and a
famous mark‚Äô, which
suggests that similarity of
marks is a prerequisite

Dilution by blurring

Later mark or essential part
thereof reproduces, imitates,
translates, or transliterates
the earlier mark

Impairment or dilution in an
unfair manner of the
distinctive character of the
earlier mark

Dilution by tarnishment

Absent

Use that would take unfair
advantage of the distinctive
character of the well-known
mark

Absent

Absent

No US equivalent, though a
comparison may be drawn
with the Revision Act, which
identifies an intention to
create an association with the
earlier mark as a factor which
will be helpful in showing
blurring

Defence

Use that is with due cause

Bespoke dilution defences,
including fair use defences

the courts, one can see that the coincidence between
the two laws occurs not just at the macro level but
also in the detailed implementation of the two dilu-
tion regimes. These types of ‚Äòmicro‚Äô similarities will
be considered in a subsequent article, with respect
to the approach that the two jurisdictions have taken
to blurring. On the US side, the focus will be on the
likely effect of the Revision Act, though illustrations
will be brought from the FTDA case law where

appropriate, while on the EU side illustrations will
be brought from ECJ, OHIM, and national case law.
The subsequent article will also consider whether
the dilution protection in general and the approach
taken to blurring in particular meets with the US
and EU‚Äôs international obligations (such as they are)
described above.
