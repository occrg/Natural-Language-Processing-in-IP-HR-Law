Trumping local marks: A note on well-known
trade marks in Nepal
Pratyush Nath Upreti*

Introduction

‚ÄòÔ¨Årst-to-Ô¨Åle‚Äô

On 2 August 2017, the Patan High Court upheld the
principle
to receive protection under
Nepalese trade mark law and refuse to consider the
trade mark ‚ÄòHavells‚Äô, which has been used in Nepal
since 2001 and over time has been expanded to cover
products like cables, wires, motors, fans, home applian-
ces among others, as a well-known trade mark in
Nepal.1 The decision did not escape criticism for pro-
viding inadequate legal protection to well-known trade
marks and the country‚Äôs negative attitude towards for-
eign brands. This note attempts to introduce the intel-
lectual property (IP) regime in Nepal and discusses
well-known trade marks in light of recent cases. The
Ô¨Årst part introduces an IP framework in Nepal, provid-
ing a helicopter view of the Ô¨Årst National IP policy is-
sued in 2017. The second part brieÔ¨Çy delineates the
international
framework for the protection of well-
known trade marks. The third part delves into the cur-
rent system of trade mark protection, examines recent
cases related to well-known trade marks. The last part
provides the drive for change in the current legislation.

Brief introduction to the intellectual
property framework in Nepal

Nepal is the Ô¨Årst least developed country (LDC) to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO) as its 147th
member. As a result of its WTO membership, Nepal
naturally receives national
treatment and most-fav-
oured-nation treatment (MFN) from all WTO mem-
bers and vice versa. During the accession negotiations,
Nepal was given a 10-year transitional period to en-
hance its system up to a level where it could enforce the
minimum standards as laid down in the Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement.2
Recent developments have extended the transitional pe-
riod for LDCs to 1 July 2021,3 or when a particular

 The recent decision of the Department of Industry

Policy emphasizes protection of well-known trade
marks and passing off action against the unauthor-

National IP Policy, the Government is currently
drafting a new ‚ÄòIndustrial Property Code‚Äô, which
aims to revise the current IP laws. The initial draft

trade marks.

Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),4 the Paris
Convention5 and the Berne Convention.6 I often refer to
IP law as a neglected stepchild in the family of laws in
Nepal. I would like to state at the outset that my concerns
have always focussed on the Government‚Äôs failure to use
the IP system based on the needs of the country. Nepal
may not need a very strong IP regime, but is nonetheless
in need of a framework to maximize the potential of geo-
graphical indications7 and biodiversity, as well as indige-
nous and traditional knowledge. Since becoming a
member of the WTO, there have been very few attempts
to develop IP laws. Unfortunately, the action plan pre-
sented during WTO accession negotiations was never
implemented.8 The main reason for this could be the ex-
tension of the transitional period for LDCs, which does
not place a mandate upon Nepal to abide by TRIPS
standards. This
also discourage
Government from initiating any IP development. Before
WTO membership, Nepal had: (i) the Patent, Design, and
Trade mark Act, 19659 and (ii) the Copyright Act, 2002.10
These have remained the principal pieces of IP legislation
in Nepal to date. However, the current framework does
not comply with international standards and practices.

relaxation might

Over the past 10 years or so, there have been several
discussions on whether to develop a national IP code
addressing all aspects of IP rights. To my knowledge, an
initial draft was Ô¨Çoated within the ministries but even-
tually failed because of lack of cooperation among them
to establish a single nodal department. The draft was
never made public. This possibly not only resulted in
plans for a national IP code being abandoned, but also
initiated the idea of having an IP policy. The recent

promulgation of a new constitution incorporating IP
within the fundamental rights chapter11 and the re-
cently conducted Nepal Investment Summit-2017 (this
highlighted how Nepal has been able to attract invest-
ment commitments, both domestic and foreign, worth
$13.52 billion) reÔ¨Çects Nepal‚Äôs investment prosperity.12
I am sceptical about including IP within the fundamen-
tal rights chapter, especially at a time when the land-
scape of IP rights is changing globally and developed
countries are opting for multilateral trade agreements
to ensure higher IP standards. Moreover, in the past,
scholarship has questioned the property nature of IP in
light of increasing compulsory licences in the patent
Ô¨Åeld, which suggests that patents are mere regulatory
rights rather than property per se.13 Not wishing to de-
velop this discussion further, it will be interesting to see
how Nepal‚Äôs courts will react to and interpret constitu-
tional provisions in the future. The increasing number
of disputes at the Department of Industry and the com-
mercial bench in the Appellate Court also indicate that
IP has become an important aspect of business rela-
tions. It was apparent that a comprehensive IP policy
was needed to encourage growth of businesses and their
development. To conclude, Nepal‚Äôs IP journey so far
may be the reality in most of the LDCs when it comes
to aiming for a stronger IP regime. In this spirit, the
next section discusses some important achievements of
the recent IP policy, as well as some resulting concerns.

positive step towards building the architecture of a
balanced IP system in this country. My Ô¨Årst impres-
sion when I read the document was that it is very gen-
eral, but nonetheless a good starting point
for
legislative reform. The policy acknowledges the prob-
lems and challenges in the current IP system. It
accepts the absence of IP policy, lack of enforcement
mechanisms and failure to revise existing laws based
on international practice. In addition, it identiÔ¨Åes the
misuse of IP rights and lack of public awareness of IP
as problems and challenges. In a nutshell, it highlights
mainly four reasons to draft the Policy document.
First, to ensure Nepal‚Äôs commitment at the time of ac-
cession to the WTO and resulting obligations.
Secondly, the absence of a national IP policy. Thirdly,
ensuring rights of authors, creating a business-
friendly environment and encouraging foreign direct
investment. Finally, it would serve to strengthen the
existing legal regime to combat piracy and counterfeit
goods. The policy was drafted after deliberate and
careful planning to provide guidance on developing a
creative nation through preservation and provision of
IP protection. To accomplish the vision, the Policy‚Äôs
mission is to achieve economic prosperity by preserv-
ing, using and protecting various aspects of IP. To
achieve this mission, the policy sets out the following
objectives:

1. To encourage protection, promotion, and develop-

ment of IP.

2. To develop a balanced IP system.

(ii) It emphasizes protection of well-known trade
marks and passing off action against the unau-
thorized use of unregistered signs.

(iii) It highlights the need for a legal framework for
indications, plant variety protec-

tion, trade secrets, biodiversity,
cuits,
and traditional

neris models for the protection of these IP rights.

(iv) It recognizes and urges to reward indigenous
people for contributing to the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity through means of
equitable beneÔ¨Åt sharing.

(v) It aims to protect traditional knowledge and de-

velop a traditional knowledge digital library.

(vi) It encourages the promotion of innovation by

means of utility models or petty patents.

(vii) It aims to establish a digital database of decisions
of the Department of Industry on trade marks,
patents and designs, and promote online docu-
mentation systems.

(viii) The Policy recognizes the importance of having a
balanced IP system. Accordingly, it emphasizes
the importance of compulsory licensing provi-
sions to ensure access to medicines and address
public health emergencies.

(ix) It treats IP rights as assets, and highlights the
need for proper IP audit and valuation methods.

4. To encourage the commercialization of IP.

5. To strengthen the legal, administrative and human
resources to ensure protection and enforcement of
IP.

(xii) It calls for an improved enforcement mechanism

liability. ?

Some important achievements

(i) The Policy acknowledges that any word, picture,
colour, shape or sound may be eligible for trade
mark registration if it can satisfy the graphic rep-
resentation requirement. In addition, the Policy
explicitly emphasizes the need to protect uncon-
ventional signs, such as sound marks and colour
marks. However, the Policy fails to explain how
these marks can satisfy the graphic representation
requirement. Moreover, the policy does not ad-

(xiii) It proposes to establish a National Intellectual
Property Council to be composed of members of
several ministries, experts and civil society repre-
sentatives. The Council would serve as a venue to
facilitate and advise on policy issues. ?

Concerns
The Policy is formulated with good intentions and
incorporates issues in the most comprehensible man-
ner. If this Policy is taken seriously and all the proposals
are implemented, then certainly Nepal will develop a
proper IP regime. However, the Policy reÔ¨Çects a gap be-
tween aspiration and implementation. Moreover, it also

gives the impression of being drafted with a very gen-
eral perspective in that it fails to consider in detail some
aspects of IP. Some of the drawbacks of the Policy are
the following:

(i) The Policy fails to acknowledge the status of
Nepal as one of the LDCs and its Ô¨Çexibilities un-
der the TRIPS Agreement. Nepal has a weak scien-
tiÔ¨Åc and technological
infrastructure: although
strong IPRs may not improve the system, they will
certainly complement its development and play an
important role in stimulating innovation. ?

(ii) It does not address the contemporary concerns of
the copyright sector. The Policy highlights the
need for a balanced copyright system when con-
sidering rightholders and consumers, but fails to
identify issues such as copyright in the digital era,
and particularly, the liability of internet service
providers. It only vaguely states that the challenges
facing
be
addressed when revising the relevant legislative
framework. ?

advancement will

technological

(iii) The Policy highlights that a registered trade mark
shall not be protected as a geographical indication,
and vice versa. However, it does not clarify the sta-
tus of registered trade marks, such as IIam tea,
which have the potential to be also registered as a
geographical indication: it was in fact because of
the absence of geographical indication protection
that IIam tea was registered as a trade mark.

(iv) Although the Policy discusses the need for an efÔ¨Å-
cient and balanced IP system, it fails to address
the needs of blind, visually impaired and print-
disabled persons. The present copyright system
does not address the need to make accessible for-
mat books available without the permission of the
author or copyright holder.15 This is important
because, as per the National Population and
Housing Census 2011, approximately 2 per cent of
the Nepali population suffers from some kind of
disability: 18.5 per cent is blind/partially sighted;
15.4 per cent is deaf/hard of hearing; and 1.8 per
cent is both deaf and blind.16

(v) The use of

Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) for teaching and research is a
very important facet of right to education. Sadly,
the Policy does not show any intention to include
a broader copyright exception for educational
purposes, nor promote open access research.

To conclude, based on the 2017 national IP Policy,
Nepal
is currently drafting industrial property code.
The Ô¨Årst draft has been discussed among the stakehold-
ers, but not yet opened to the public for feedback.

The international framework for
protection of well-known trade marks

IP rights are inherently territorial, and the traditional
or classical understanding of the protection of trade
marks leads to problems for the protection of foreign
brands. In today‚Äôs world, globalization and the rise of
the internet have made access and dissemination easier,
and this facilitates a brand transcending national bor-
ders.17 The scale of trans-border advertisement and sale
easily establish the link between the product and mark
irrespective of
the use of products by consumers.
However, the problem of traditional understanding of
the protection of trade marks is that, irrespective of be-
ing famous, a mark must be registered or used in a
country. It means that a trade mark owner cannot pre-
vent third parties from using the mark unless it is regis-
tered or used in the country. Modern trade mark
protection has developed the concept of the mark with
a reputation or well-known marks as an exception to
the territoriality principle embedded within the trade
mark system. A trade mark which has earned reputa-
tion is understood and referred through several expres-
sions such as well-known trade marks, famous trade
marks, widely-known trade marks, trade marks with a
reputation, etc.18 Existing literature reveals that these
words are used interchangeably, but some countries
and judicial decisions make a distinction between well-
known and famous trade marks.19 I will not re-visit this
debate, but brieÔ¨Çy analyze the international framework
for the protection of well-known trade marks: the Paris
Convention and TRIPS.

The Paris convention & TRIPS agreement

of

6bis

the Protection of

The expression ‚Äòwell-known mark‚Äô was Ô¨Årst used in the
the
1883 Paris Convention for
Industrial Property. Article
the Paris
Convention guarantees special protection to the well-
known marks. The Paris Convention does not deÔ¨Åne
well-known mark, neither it provides conditions to de-
termine well-known marks. It simply refers to the ter-
minology in reference to possibilities of
‚Äòrefusal or
cancellation of registration, or prohibition of the use of
the mark which has become well-known in a country‚Äô.
A careful reading of Article 6bis Paris Convention pro-
vides four essential elements: (i) it excludes ‚Äòservices
‚Äúfrom the preview of well-known marks‚Äù‚Äô20; (ii) the
concept of well-known trade marks is limited to a spe-
ciÔ¨Åc country21; (iii) it does not deÔ¨Åne or provide ele-
ments to determine well-known trade marks, rather
leaves it to ‚Äòcompetent authority of the country of regis-
tration or use‚Äô to determine well-known trade marks22;
(iv) it provides a narrow scope of protection‚Äîwell-
known trade marks extends only to the identical or
similar goods, excluding unauthorized association of
well-known trade marks irrespective of similar or iden-
tical goods or services.23

In 1995, the TRIPS Agreement expanded the protec-
tion of well-known trade marks in two ways. First, it
expanded the scope of protection of well-known trade
marks by incorporating provision which ensured pro-
tection against the unauthorized association of marks
irrespective of similar or identical goods or services.24

nection between goods or services and the foreign mark

Secondly, it extended the concept of well-known marks
to services.26 Thirdly,
it did not deÔ¨Åne well-known
marks but added a sentence: ‚Äòin determining whether a
trade mark is well-known, Members shall take account
of the knowledge of the trade mark in the relevant sec-
tor of the public, including knowledge in the Member
concerned which has been obtained as a result of the

is what does ‚Äòknowledge of the trade mark in the rele-

deÔ¨Åne the meaning of ‚Äòrelevant sector‚Äô, but in compari-
son with the Paris Convention, it certainly gives a broad
meaning to the concept of well-known trade marks.
The Paris Convention conÔ¨Åned the notion of well-
known trade marks to a ‚Äòcountry speciÔ¨Åc‚Äô‚Äîwhich means
a trade mark can be well-known only in a country
where the mark has been registered or used, and the
public in that country recognizes the mark.28 The use
of ‚Äòrelevant sector‚Äô broadens the concept of well-known
marks, in other words, it recognizes the concept of the
trans-border reputation of a trade mark.29 Thus, a
mark to be well-known does not necessarily need to be
used in a speciÔ¨Åc country if the mark is well-known to
the public at large in any relevant sector outside the
country is enough to gain the status of well-known
trade marks in any country if consumers can associate
the mark.

of Well-Known Marks‚Äô30 provides some lights to the as-
sessment. Article 2(1) (b) of the Joint Recommendation
offers some non-exhaustive guidelines to the competent
authority to take into consideration while determining
the mark as well-known.31 Similarly, Article 2 (2) of the
Joint Recommendation provides some factors to con-
sider the relevant sector of the public; (i) actual and/ or
potential consumers of the types of goods and/or serv-
ices to which the mark applies (ii) persons involved in
channels of distribution of the type of goods and/ or
services to which the mark applies (iii) business circles
dealing with the type of goods and/ or services to which
the mark applies. If one carefully reads Article 16(2)
TRIPS, it refers to ‚Äòincluding knowledge in the Member
concerned which has been obtained as a result of the
promotion of the trade mark‚Äô, it gives an impression
that any information or knowledge gained through pro-
motion outside the jurisdiction could be considered in

a well-known mark.32 The

Joint
determining
Recommendation, instead, excludes the knowledge of
the mark outside the jurisdiction as a condition for de-
termining whether a mark is well-known.33 Thus, the
current system of protection for well-known trade
marks depends on the jurisdiction. At the conceptual
level, well-known trade marks are recognized by most
of the countries but its application may differ.34 To
conclude, the Paris Convention presented well-known
trade marks as an exception to the territorial rights of
trade mark, whereas the TRIPS created global rules for
the protection of well-known marks. However,
the
open-ended language used in TRIPS have left member
states to determine criteria for well-known trade marks
which has been subject to debate in the application at
the national level.

The legal framework for protection of
trade marks in Nepal

The legal framework for the protection of trade marks
is set out in the Patent, Design, and Trade Mark Act
(PDTA) 1965. The PDTA replaced the Patent, Design
and Trade mark Law, 1936.35 The 1936 Act excluded
services from the protection of trade marks which later
introduced in the 1965 Act, which remains to be instru-
mental in governing industrial property in Nepal with
only two amendments36 since its commencement. The
Preamble to the 1965 PDTA highlights the necessity to
protect ‚Äòpatents, design, and trade marks for the conve-
nience and economic beneÔ¨Åt of the general public‚Äô. The
helicopter view of the Act does not give an impression
that it was introduced to beneÔ¨Åt the general public.
One may argue that such language was used in a sense
that the Act prohibits similarity of marks, in essence,
avoids confusion to the general public. It may sound
too naƒ±¬®ve to say that the careful reading of the chapter
related to Patent and Design does not include any pro-
vision on the compulsory licence, or in essence, there
has been no attempt to balance public and private

rights. Therefore, a reference to ‚Äòconvenience and bene-
Ô¨Åt of
is hard to understand.
Nonetheless, it does give an impression the 1965 Act
was introduced to provide to protect the owner of the
mark through registration. The fact that the Act guar-
antees rights to author, trade mark holder and inventor,
taking that into consideration, it can be argued the ref-
erence to the ‚Äòeconomic beneÔ¨Åt to the general public‚Äô
may refer to the sentiments of encouraging and pro-
moting business in Nepal.

The PDTA confers the ownership after the registra-
tion of trade marks.37 The application for trade mark
registration is Ô¨Åled at
the Department of Industry
(DOI),38which is also the nodal department for indus-
trial property in Nepal. The DOI has two main func-
tions. First, it performs an administrative function by
registering trade marks which qualify for registration
the PDTA and examination guidelines.39
under
Similarly,
it maintains a trade marks registry which
registers renewal, licensing and assignment. Secondly,
the DOI functions as a quasi-judicial body which hears
opposition, revocation and takes action against unau-
thorized use of trade marks. The DOI conducts a sub-
stantive and a procedural examination of the trade
mark application. The trade mark may be refused if it
(i) hurts the prestige of any individual or institution40;
(ii) adversely affects the public conduct or morality;
(iii) undermines the national interest; (iv) undermines
the reputation of the previously registered trade-mark
(iv) registered previously. The Act provides an opportu-
nity for parties to present their cases including opposi-
tion and revocation proceedings within the timeline.41
The qualiÔ¨Åed trade mark is registered for seven years
from the date of registration and protection may be vir-
tually perpetual, subject to timely renewal.42 The for-
eign mark is registered in Nepal and priority can be
claimed by including registration date and application
number of a mark registered in any other country
(member to the Paris Convention) in its trade mark ap-
plication in Nepal.43 The current trade mark framework
does not complement the TRIPS: However,

note, I will not evaluate TRIPS compatibility of the
Nepalese trade mark law, which has been done by
others on a previous occasion.44

The current structure for the
protection of well-known trade marks

The term ‚Äòwell-known trade mark‚Äô is neither used nor
has it been deÔ¨Åned in the Patent, Design and Trade
Mark Act of 1965. In some occasions, the Nepalese
courts have discussed well-known trade marks and their
application in Nepal.45 There is no speciÔ¨Åc provision
on well-known trade marks. The 1965 Act creates bar-
riers for protecting brands through the Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Åle sys-
tem of trade mark protection. In this section, I will
discuss the Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Åle system and recent cases related to
well-known trade marks.

First to Ô¨Åle system

In Nepal, Section 16(1) of PDTA guarantees rights, title
to the trade mark after registration. Unlike in some ju-
risdiction like India,46 it is not possible to establish a
trade mark right through use, in other words a mark
cannot acquire distinctiveness through use in Nepal.

the DOI. These provisions highlight

Section 21 B indicates that registration is the pre-
requisite to acquire rights over the mark. The provision
starts with ‚Äòtitle not to be valid unless registered in Nepal‚Äô
and emphasizes that a ‚Äòtrade mark registered in a for-
eign country shall not be valid in Nepal unless it is reg-
istered in Nepal‚Äô. Similarly, Section18B prohibits the
use of trade marks as a registered mark without regis-
tering at
that
Nepal follows Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Åle as a system to protect trade
marks. Although, PDTA does not prohibit the use of
marks without registration,
in such cases the right-
holder is not entitled to receive statutory protection. It
is important to note that Sections 18B and 21B were in-
troduced by the Ô¨Årst amendment in 1987. The earlier
1936 legislation also emphasizes registration of trade
marks to gain a legal status47 but did not expressly had
a provision similar to Sections18B or 21B. The relevant

In the past, there have been several trade mark disputes involving Indian
brands such as Panparag, Dhara Oil, Havells, Rajanighandha, Havells,
and Pepsico among others. See Shilpi Saxena, ‚ÄòNepal: Trade Mark
Infringements: The Big Problems Faced by Foreign Brands in

question is whether Nepal protects an unregistered
trade mark. The answer has two parts: First, there is no
speciÔ¨Åc provision related to unregistered trade mark,
but recent practices of courts and the DOI have shown
a positive attitude towards protecting unregistered
mark if it has gained a reputation among the relevant
section of the consumers. Secondly, there has been no
single case where a Nepalese mark has been deemed
protected as an unregistered mark because DOI gives
importance to the registration of trade marks. As a re-
sult, most of the manufacturers and producers regis-
tered their mark before using them in the market and
also to minimize the risk of infringement.

Cases related to well-known trade marks

In recent years, multinational companies, particularly
Indian brands have been facing serious problems in
protecting their marks, which have earned a reputation
through use. That is due to an inadequate provision
protecting well-known trade marks under the PDTA
1965. The fact that the Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Åle system has encour-
aged local companies to register famous Indian marks
in Nepal undermines Indian companies‚Äô business48 and
tarnishes Nepal‚Äôs imagine due to inadequate protection
for foreign brands. In this section, I will brieÔ¨Çy analyse
some landmark decisions related to well-known trade
marks.

Adani Wilmar Limited v Nutri Foods Pvt Ltd
Adani Wilmar Limited v Nutri Foods Pvt Ltd49 is one of
the high proÔ¨Åle cases where the Patan Appellate Court
rejected the concept of well-known trade marks in
Nepal. The mark ‚ÄúFORTUNE‚Äù was Ô¨Åled for registration
in Class 3050 by Nutri Foods and the application was
opposed by Indian company Adani Wilmar Limited
which registered the mark ‚ÄòFORTUNE‚Äô in Classes 29,
30 and 31 in India51 and Class 29 in Nepal and also has
Ô¨Åled an application for Class 30.52 Similarly, the Indian
mark ‚ÄòFORTUNE‚Äô has been registered in other parts of
South East Asia since 2000. The question before the
court was whether the mark ‚ÄòFORTUNE‚Äô was well-

known in Nepal and, therefore, entitled to receive pro-
tection irrespective of the Class in which it had been
registered. Adani Wilmer Ltd argued that as a member
of the Paris Convention, Nepal is obliged to recognize
well-known trade marks. According to Section 9 of the
Nepal Treaty Act, 199053 a treaty, once ratiÔ¨Åed, ac-
ceded, accepted or approved, its provisions become ap-
plicable as the law of Nepal and will prevail over other
laws in the event of an inconsistency with those laws.54
In other words, the supremacy of treaties over domestic
laws will prevail if the treaty is passed by the parlia-
ment. It is important to note that the ambiguity in
Nepal‚Äôs application of international treaty in national
law has been subject to debate.55 On direct application
of international law to the domestic law, the court care-
fully read the language of Article 6bis and gave impor-
tance to ‚Äòthe countries of the Union undertake, ex
ofÔ¨Åcio if their legislation so permit‚Äô to argue that the
provision is not applied automatically to the member
countries, rather it should be implemented through na-
tional legislation.56 Similarly, the court referred to sev-
eral other provision of
the Paris Convention to
establish that the Convention provides freedom to im-
plement its provisions at the national level.57 For exam-
ple, the court refers to Article 2, the national treatment
provision which ensures the state must grant the same
protection to nationals of other contracting states that
it grants to its own nationals. However, the court gave
importance to the last sentence of Article 2(1), which
reads ‚Äòprovided that the conditions and formalities im-
posed upon nationals are complied with‚Äô.58 Similarly,
the Court also referred to Article 8 of the Convention,
which emphasizes that ‚Äòa trade name shall be protected
in all the countries of the Union without the obligation
of Ô¨Åling or registration, whether or not it forms part of
a trade mark.‚Äô The reference to these provisions of the
Convention was to establish that being a member to the
Convention it didn‚Äôt oblige Nepal to follow Ô¨Årst-to-use

system of protection, rather provides freedom to adopt
accordingly. On this premise, the Court reached the
conclusion that Nepal has adopted a Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Åle sys-
tem.59 Therefore, a mark registered in a foreign country
will earn legal status in Nepal only after registration.
Furthermore, to establish that Nepal adopts a different
system from other countries, the court referred to a
previous Supreme Court decision which emphasizes
that ‚Äòa trade mark receives legal protection once regis-
tered in accordance with Nepalese law. The continuous
use of the mark in Nepal without registration is irrele-
vant and holds no signiÔ¨Åcance‚Äô.60 In the end, answering

Regarding the question of well-known trade marks,
the court discussed Article 6bis Paris Convention in de-
tail,62 cited several Indian decisions63 and offered some
criteria to determine well-known trade marks such as
market survey, duration and extent of advertisement or
promotion of the mark, sales and tax records, and re-
ceipt of customs Ô¨Åling among others. However, the
court observed that these criteria should not be consid-
ered as an exhaustive list: the well-known status should
be assessed on a case by case basis.64 In response to the
Adani Wilmar argument that the mark ‚ÄòFORTUNE‚Äô
had been registered under Classes 29, 30, and 31 in
more than nineteen countries to show that the mark is
known globally, the court observed that ‚Äòregistration of
the mark in 19 countries does not make that mark well-
known per se in Nepal‚Äô.65 Furthermore,
the Court
observes that ‚Äòregistration of the mark in several juris-
dictions or use of the mark in many foreign countries

treaty shall be enforceable as good as Nepalese laws‚Äô.

for an extended period of time‚Äô does not make a mark
well-known in Nepal.66 The Court emphasized that du-
ration, extent of any use of the mark and number of
users are also important factors to be considered.67
However, the burden lies on the owner to prove that
their mark is well-known.68 One important
factor
which the Court took into consideration was that the
Adani Wilmer Ltd mark ‚ÄòFortune‚Äô was registered in
Class 29 and the defendant mark was applied for in
Class 30.69 Therefore, the Court concluded that the
Adani Wilmer Ltd mark ‚ÄòFORTUNE‚Äô had yet to be-
come well-known in Nepal and dissimilarity of goods
was enough to avoid confusion.70 Thus, it allowed both
the marks to co-exist in different categories.

Prem Mehandi Center v. Habib Kala Kokila Hennas71

fore the court was whether the Prem Mehandi Center
trade mark ‚ÄòNISHA‚Äô which had been in use in Nepal
without registration had acquired a well-known status
in Nepal. To answer the question, the court referred to
the language of Section 18 of PDTA, 1965, ‚Äòreputation
of the trade mark of any other person‚Äô, and observed
that an assessment of reputed mark is based on (i) the
duration of use of the trade mark in Nepal (ii) record
of invoices and bills of sales (iii) extent of advertise-
ment through television, FM stations and Newspaper72.
The court referred to the Paris Convention and dis-
cussed the reference of terminologies used in different
jurisdictions to understand the concept of well-known
trade marks. However, the Court did not differentiate
between the mark with a reputation and well-known
marks: rather it took into consideration the use of word
‚Äòreputation and well-known‚Äô in other Nepalese legisla-
tion to argue that the meaning of word ‚Äòreputation and
well-known‚Äô may not be uniform but, in a nutshell, it
refers to the positive association between products and
consumers.73 In other words,
‚Äòreputation and well-
known‚Äô makes a positive afÔ¨Åliation or impression in the

mind of consumers.74 To elaborate, the court referred
to the facts of the case and observed that if consumers
mentally connect ‚ÄòNISHA‚Äô products for hair colouring,
then this would be enough to be considered as well-
known marks.75 According to the Court, users are
mapped through- survey, sales records and in case of
foreign product- the amount of production, duration
and extent of use of the product, advertisement, Ô¨Ånan-
cial details of marketing and others measures.76 It is in-
teresting to note that the court recalled that the list is
not exhaustive and future assessment should be on a
case-by-case basis.77 Thus, the Court took advertise-
ment, distribution and sales records into account to
conclude that the use of mark and continuance of the
product in Nepal have made the ‚ÄòNISHA‚Äô a well-known
mark in Nepal. Hence, ordered DOI to rectify its deci-
sion to register a similar trade mark which includes a
composite mark consisting of NISHA.

Facebook Inc v Amrit Distillery Pvt Ltd
Facebook Inc v Amrit Distillery Pvt Ltd78 was the Ô¨Årst
case where the DOI, acting as a quasi-judicial body in
opposition proceeding declared a foreign mark as a
well-known trade mark in Nepal. The dispute was de-
cided by the director general of DOI.
In Nepal,
Facebook Inc has held a trade mark registration for
‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô in Classes 9, 35, 38, 41, 42 and 45 since 21
March 2012.79 The defendant, Amrit Distillery, Ô¨Åled for
trade mark registration for a sign identical
to the
Facebook Inc. trade mark under Class 33.80 The ques-
tion before the DOI was whether the mark ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô
had acquired well-known status in Nepal and, if so,
would receive protection beyond the categories of
goods and services in which it is registered. The ques-
tion was similar to Adani Wilmar v Nutri Foods Pvt Ltd,
but the Ô¨Ånding of the case was different. Facebook Inc
argued that its mark has become well-known globally
and 72 per cent of internet users in Nepal use its plat-
form www.facebook.com. Therefore, the majority of the
population is well acquainted with Facebook.81 On the
other hand, Amrit Distillery contended that
the
Facebook Inc had not registered its mark in Class 33,

which deals with alcohol products.82 Therefore, by vir-
tue of Section 18A of PDTA, which maintains that
‚Äòtrade mark registered for goods or services in one cate-
gory. . ..may be registered for goods or services under
another category if it so falls‚Äô, Amrit Distillery argued
that‚Äîsince their trade mark application dealt with a
different Class than the Facebook Inc. trade mark, it
would be entitled to registration of the mark. In con-
trast, Facebook Inc. contended that Amrit Distillery ap-
plied for an identical mark under Class 33 which would
blur and tarnish its mark‚Äôs reputation and goodwill.83
Similarly, it asserted that the intention of defendant to
apply for identical trade mark under a different Class
was aimed at beneÔ¨Åtting from the goodwill earned by
Facebook Inc.84 The director general of DOI rendered a
decision in favour of Facebook Inc. on three grounds.
First, he analysed Section 18(1) proviso of the PDTA
1965, which emphasizes that a trade mark may not be
registered:

if ‚Äòsuch trade mark may hurt the prestige of any individual
or institution or adversely affect the public conduct or mo-
rality or undermine the national interest or the reputation
of the trade mark of any other person, or in the case such
trade mark is found to have already been registered in the
name of another person..‚Äô.

The director general linked the above paragraph to the
concept of unfair competition and observed that the
above paragraph is aimed at ensuring and encouraging
a fair and competitive business environment in Nepal
where one does not take advantage of others. However,
the director general did not elaborate on the meaning
of unfair practice. Nonetheless, its reference to unfair
practice indicates that a trade mark application should
not dilute the ‚Äòreputation of the trade mark‚Äô by setting
a minimum level of fairness to be practiced.85 Perhaps
this is the Ô¨Årst decision which emphasizes that unfair
practice would be a potential remedy in trade mark dis-
putes in Nepal. Thus, this decision ensures the protec-
tion of foreign trade mark based on the principle of
unfair practices.

Secondly, with regards to the argument of identical
marks with a different Class of goods, he held that there
is no meaningful relationship between Section 18(1)
and classiÔ¨Åcation of goods and services in case of marks
which are identical or an imitation of registered marks
protected under different categories.86 In other words,
an application for a similar or identical registered mark
in different categories of goods or services is not
enough to receive protection; it has to go through the
scrutiny of Section 18(1). In the context of the case, the
decision is relevant because of the reputation and popu-
larity of the Facebook. However, it is disappointing that
the director general played with the language of the
text. Instead, he should have emphasized principles re-
lated to consumer confusion and elaborate more to es-
tablish jurisprudence on the subject. Thus, the take
away from the decision is that the dissimilarity of goods
or services is irrelevant only in the cases related to well-
known trade marks.

Thirdly, the decision questioned the defendant‚Äôs in-
tent in adopting the mark, which is an imitation of
Facebook Inc trade mark.87 The director general held
that the defendant held no goodwill or reputation of
their own because there was no evidence of prior use or
registration outside of Nepal. Therefore the defendant
aimed to free ride88 on the goodwill and investment
made by Facebook Inc.89 Overall, the decision recog-
nizes ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô as a well-known mark and concludes
that registration of identical marks in Class 33(alcoholic
beverages) other than the registered mark will tarnish
the reputation of the Facebook. To the best of my
knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst instance where DOI have ac-
cepted the arguments of unfair competition and re-
ferred free riding in relation to intentionally taking
unfair advantage of established trade mark.90

social, economic status, along with political instability
might have discouraged attention towards IP. However,
in recent times, the increasing number of trade mark
Ô¨Ålings and disputes related to foreign trade marks have
come to the attention not only of
lawyers and
Government, but also media. No doubt current legisla-
tion is in need of reform, but there is also a need to ad-
dress the conceptual misunderstanding surrounding
well-known trade marks. The fear of open borders with
India might prove too easy for Indian companies to es-
tablish a case for well-known trade marks in Nepal,
might be the great uneasiness to the government to ac-
knowledge well-known marks through speciÔ¨Åc legal
provision. This thinking is conventional and contradic-
tory to the government priority91 to create an environ-
ment for foreign investment.92 I want to clarify that I
do not advocate for changing the current system of
trade mark protection to a Ô¨Årst-to-use. Rather I argue
that Nepal should be open towards protecting foreign
brands. The speciÔ¨Åc statutory provision on well-known
trade marks will ensure legal certainty. The Paris
Convention and TRIPS recognize well-known trade
marks and provide freedom for the member states to
adopt criteria‚Äôs for protecting well-known trade marks.
Nepal should take this as an opportunity to create a
practice which is based on its socio-economic needs,
rather
reasons.
International practice demonstrates that there are di-
verse approaches towards protecting well-known trade
marks.93 Therefore, based on its own national needs,
Nepal can develop its own criteria. This country should
learn from practices in other jurisdictions and should
be able to openly accept and recognize well-known
marks. The concerned department should also be able
to come up with a white paper on well-known trade
marks to generate discussion and debate on the subject.

Similarly, the previous development plan95 had provi-
sions which would encourage foreign capital, technol-
ogy, development of industry and among others. The
establishment of the Investment Board of Nepal (IBN)
to facilitate foreign investor and past memorandum of
understanding96 and commitment to create a business-
friendly environment has
forced the Ministry of
Industry, Commerce and Supplies to bring reforms to
the existing IP regime. In particular, the increasing
cases related to well-known mark decided against mul-
tinational companies which have been operating in
Nepal for years without registration have raised con-
cerns. Although the Government report considers ‚Äòfor-
eign owned trade mark or goodwill‚Äô as forms of foreign
investment in Nepal,97 there are instances where, after
losing a case, foreign companies have used the diplo-
matic channel to pressure the Government into bring-
ing legislative reform and recognize the international
practice of protecting well-known trade marks. The re-
cent decision to recognize ‚ÄòFacebook‚Äô as a well-known
trade mark shows Government‚Äôs changing attitude to-
wards well-known marks. This is a positive step, and
such development will discourage those who have been
taking advantage of Ô¨Årst-to-Ô¨Åle system and intentionally
register identical or similar marks to free ride on the in-
vestment and goodwill earned by foreign brands.

Conclusion

The above analysis has focused on the evolving approach
to protection of well-known trade marks in Nepal. The
2017 National IP Policy emphasizes protection of well-
known trade marks and passing off action against the
unauthorized use of unregistered marks. In line with the
National IP policy, DOI is currently drafting a new ‚Äòin-
dustrial property code‚Äô which aims to revise the current
IP laws. The initial draft98 has a provision related to
well-known trade marks. There are three noticeable pro-
visions on well-known marks. First, the proposed law
imposes a duty on DOI to protect trade marks which
have become well-known but not registered as well-
known trade marks in Nepal. Second, it provides several
criteria to determine well-known trade marks, such as:

(i) registration of the mark in the national or foreign

country

(ii) use of
country

the mark in the national or foreign

(iii) extent and duration of use of the mark

(iv) market share of the products and services

(v) value associated with the mark

(vi) record of Ô¨Ånancial detail for advertisement of the

mark

(vii) record of successful enforcement of the mark in

any other jurisdiction

(viii) recognition as well-known trade marks in any

other jurisdiction.

The proposed change to the Ô¨Årst to use system is some-
thing which has been lobbied by foreign companies to
ensure the protection of their brands. The draft bill
gives priority to the Ô¨Årst to Ô¨Åle, but in case of sufÔ¨Åcient
evidence which proves that a mark in question is in use
before the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åling then the earlier mark receives pro-
tection based on prior use. To conclude, the proposed
draft law has a clear and broad provision as compared
to the seven point guidelines of the DOI.

98 The initial draft is not available publicly. I am thankful to the

Information on the Intellectual Property Society (IPPSON-Nepal) for

providing me the initial draft. The text is available in Nepali language
and I take full responsibility for the translation.
