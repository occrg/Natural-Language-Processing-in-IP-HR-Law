The EU and Colombia/Peru Free Trade
Agreement on GIs: adjusting Colombian
and Peruvian national laws?
Patricia Covarrubia*

The protection of geographical indications (GIs) is of
value for national growth. This type of protection sig-
niﬁes historical and emblematic links between citizens
and the place of origin.2 However, the recognition of
GIs as a form of IP is still debatable. The present paper
evaluates GIs as product-distinctive signs.3 GIs may
thus be protected as certiﬁcation marks, collective
marks, and unfair competition laws, among other
things. The purpose of this paper is to present and
analyse the current and speciﬁc legislation that protects
GIs in the EU and in two Andean countries, Colombia
and Peru, due to the recently concluded4 FTA between
these countries.

Background
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on
the Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS) provides a level of protection for its
signatory countries, which includes
the European
Union (EU), Colombia, and Peru. TRIPS speciﬁcally
demands adequate protection to prevent false labelling
or presentation of goods in relation to GIs. While
members have discretion as to the form and methods
of
it should be borne in
mind that TRIPS only offers stricter protection to GIs
for wines and spirits.

While the EU bloc and the two Andean countries
have drawn up speciﬁc legislation to protect GIs,
thus meeting the TRIPS requirements, the statutes
are not actually the same. This paper opens by

practice between those countries is too far apart.
Finally,

Colombia and Peru is just starting to develop, and

to highlight

This paper aims

the discrepancies
between two sets of legislation (the EU bloc and the
Andean bloc), and thus to present the disadvantage
of accepting policies
in any trade agreement—a
message that other developing countries need to be
aware of.

Legal framework of GIs
GIs are protected in a number of ways. The form of
protection must be in accordance with signed accords
and treaties such as the Paris Convention, the TRIPS
Agreement (signed by Colombia, Peru, and the EU),
and/or the Lisbon Agreement (signed by Peru and
some EU members). To this effect, TRIPS (the only
agreement to which the EU, Colombia, and Peru are
signatories) will be studied. The Lisbon Agreement will
also be analysed since it provides for the protection of
Appellations of Origin (AOs) and their international
registration in a coherent manner.

At the national level, GIs may be speciﬁcally pro-
tected by a variety of laws or instruments, depending
on the country. The EU, Colombia, and Peru have set
up a sui generis system for the protection of GIs in
their respective countries.5 In the EU, the products
protected are limited to wines, spirits, agricultural
products, and foodstuffs, while in Colombia and Peru
the protection of GIs is not limited to those products
but also includes industrial and handicraft products.6
The legislation of all those countries is applicable to
national products and to those of third countries as
well.

Note that there are many terms and concepts for
GIs. These can sometimes be confusing and misunder-
stood and may cause inconvenience for countries that
borrow legislation, as what happens with developing
countries.

The international arena
TRIPS only refers to GIs in general. It does not refer to
AOs or to designations of origin (DOs), but covers a
concept that appears to be wider in scope and so
becomes useful to developing countries.7 Article 22(1)
establishes that GIs are ‘indications which identify a
good as originating in the territory of a Member, or a
region or locality in that
territory, where a given
quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is
essentially attributable to its geographical origin’.

TRIPS calls for adequate protection to prevent false
labelling or presentation of goods in relation to GIs. It
provides a minimum level of protection for its signa-
tory countries. In the same vein, it offers a higher level
of protection for GIs for wines and spirits (Article
23.1). TRIPS only requires members to adopt legal
means to protect GIs but does not specify how this
must be done.8

It has been observed that TRIPS makes no reference
to what types of products are to be protected. Instead
there is the belief that ‘any’ product with those charac-
teristics laid in Article 22(1) will do, and may thus
include natural, agricultural, and manufactured goods
(for instance handicrafts). Also observed is the need to
take into consideration any natural and/or human
factors that affect the characterization of the product
but in a general way; according to the Lisbon Agree-
ment, however,

In Article 23.1, TRIPS establishes that even in the

of protection extends to the unauthorized use when

argued that the current level of protection (Article
22) is more than adequate. It was also argued that
this measure was protectionist and would impose
additional ﬁnancial and administrative burdens. They
also rejected the accusation of theft, particularly in
cases where migrants from the ‘old continent’ bring
to their new home countries (the ‘new world’) these
methods and knowledge.

Finally, regarding TRIPS, these two policies (Articles
22 and 23) are taken into account in the legislation in
the EU, Colombia, and Peru, and therefore include the
stricter norm for wines and spirits. Further, EU Regu-
lation 510/20069 for agricultural products and foodstuff
offers a similar scope of protection granted to that of
the wines and spirits GIs.

TRIPS is not the only agreement that covers GIs.
The Lisbon Agreement is more speciﬁc in its pro-
visions. It protects GIs in the form of AOs. However,
some EU members10 and Colombia are not signatories
to the Lisbon Agreement and therefore are not bound
by it. The Lisbon Agreement deﬁnes an AO as ‘the geo-
graphical name of a country, region, or locality, which
serves to designate a product originating therein, the
quality and characteristics of which are due exclusively
or essentially to the geographical environment, includ-
ing natural and human factors’.11 As mentioned, to be
granted AO status,
the product needs natural and
human factors to happen. Under the Lisbon Agree-
ment, an AO enjoys full rights if it is registered at the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), but
it should be registered ﬁrst in its country of origin.
This agreement requires member states to protect the
AO product against misleading use even in misuse
cases when the consumer may not be deceived about
the origin of the product. It therefore extends a higher
protection in that
it protects cases where the true
origin of the product is indicated or the appellation is
used in translation or is accompanied by terms such as
‘kind’, ‘type’, ‘make’, or ‘imitation’.12

According to these two international

terms and
deﬁnitions, all AOs are GIs, but it does not mean that
all GIs are AOs.13 This appears clear at ﬁrst but gets
complicated—as we will see below.

The EU
For many decades (even centuries), European countries
have set up legislation to protect GIs, for instance the
XIV century French legislation protecting ‘Roquefort’
cheese.14 Therefore, it is no surprise that the EU has
played a leading role in the development, recognition,
and protection of this subject. In the EU, GIs are regu-
lated separately from the trade mark system.15 Legis-
lation is promulgated by the European Commission,
whose system has replaced to a large degree the residual
national systems in the EU,
thus harmonizing the
national laws.16

The EU system speaks of the DO (protected DO, or
PDO) and GI (protected GI, or PGI). It also covers the
certiﬁcation of Traditional
Speciality Guaranteed
(TSG). Thus many agricultural and foodstuff products
are protected through the GI regime.17 There is no
doubt indeed that the EU has sought to raise the stan-
dards of IP protection beyond that contemplated in
TRIPS.

Since GI regulations only protect wines and spirits
and agricultural products and foodstuffs, they leave
aside craft and/or industrial products. However, for the
protection of non-agricultural GI products, producers
can rely on the Community trade mark (CTM) regime
that allows for the protection of geographical names
under certain conditions.18 They can also be protected
by the Lisbon Agreement and by national legislation.
Now we turn to study the terms and deﬁnitions that
the EU regulations do protect, bearing in mind that
those covered in this paper do not apply to wine-sector
products, except wine vinegars, or spirit drinks.

Regulation 510/2006 of the European Council19
This Regulation protects GIs and DOs for agricultural
products and foodstuffs. It establishes the PDO as that
which designates the name of a product whose pro-
duction, processing, and preparation must be made in
a given geographical area, with recognized quality or
characteristics that are essentially or exclusively due to
a particular geographical environment with its inherent
natural and human factors. For example, ‘Prosciutto di

Parma’,20 ‘Feta’ cheese,21 and ‘Roquefort’22 are all listed
on the FTA. In contrast, the PGI is deﬁned as the name
of a geographical place that is used to describe an agri-
cultural product or a foodstuff that originates in that
place and possesses a speciﬁc quality, reputation, or
other characteristic attributable to that geographical
origin, the production and/or processing and/or pre-
paration of which take place in the deﬁned geographical
area. For example, ‘Emmental de Savoie’,23 ‘Turro´ n de
Alicante’,24 and ‘Toscano’ oil25 are all on the FTA list.

Some of the differences between PDOs and PGIs are
important to this discussion. First, the PDO requires all
stages—production, processing, and preparation—to be
carried out in one named geographical area while the
PGI only requires ‘one’ stage to be carried in the named
geographical area. Secondly, although the causal link for
both is the geographical area and the relation between
origin and quality, the PDO is more of a certiﬁable fact
and PGI more of a reputation fact.26 Thirdly, according
to the law there is no need for PGIs to demonstrate the
intervention of the environment—natural and human
factors—while PDOs need to do so.

Regulation 509/2006 of the European Council27
This Regulation refers to the term Traditional Special-
ities Guaranteed (TSG).
this
expression does not refer to geographical origin but
aims to highlight a traditional composition of

for instance,
and ‘Pizza Napoletana’,30 among which only the ﬁrst
product is on the FTA.

The level of protection granted to PDOs, PGIs, and
TSGs is the same in the way that those products enjoy
the same ‘basic’ rights. Nonetheless, the level of protec-
tion for PDOs and PGIs is higher than that for TSGs.
Article 13 of Regulation 510/2006 establishes that they
are protected against ‘any misuse, imitation or evoca-
tion, even if the true origin of the product is indicated
or if the protected name is translated or accompanied
by an expression such as “style”, “type”, “method”, “as
produced in”, “imitation” or similar’. In the case of
Regulation 509/2006, this provision is absent. Nonethe-

less, in its Article 17, it protects TSG products against
any practice that is liable to mislead the consumer,
including ‘imitation’ of TSG names.

To enjoy the rights granted by these two GI regu-
lations, the product must be registered. Moreover, the
EU regulations require that each of these special pro-
ducts (PDO, PGI, and TSG) be independently third-
party certiﬁed by an authorized inspection body to
verify production standards. The application for regis-
tration is submitted to the competent authority in the
member states (nationally) and then, after examination,
is sent to the European Commission that will inspect
the procedure to ensure that application satisﬁes the
conditions laid down by the EU GI regulations and that
the approach is uniform across the member states.31

Colombia and Peru
Colombia and Peru are part of the Andean Community
of Nations formed by Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and
Peru. The Andean Community operates a customs
it pursues economic and
union similar to the EU;
social development
through cooperation and inte-
gration. It boasts a common IP regime governed by
Decision 486, which reﬂects the rules laid down by
TRIPS and succeeds national laws.32

With regard to the protection of GIs,

the legal
system consists of a common system of IP contained in
Decision 486. The Andean Community thus incorpor-
ates GIs as a section of its existing IP legislation. Both
Colombia and Peru have internally regulated this
subject as part of
their existing law. For instance,
Colombia regulates it under its Commercial Code33
and Peru under Legislative Decree No 1075.
Decision 486, Title XII Geographical

Indication,
regulates this subject. Two ﬁgures exist under this title:
Denomination of Origin and Indications of Source (in
the English version they are named as AOs and Indi-
cations of Origin). These two ﬁgures are different and
so are their protection levels;
the term GI is not
deﬁned, but includes these two.

nized as an AO. It is deﬁned as a ‘geographical indi-

cation consisting of the name of a particular country,
region, or locality, or of a name which, without being
that of a particular country, region, or locality, refers to
a speciﬁc geographical area, which name is used to
identify a product originating therein, the qualities,
reputation, or characteristics of which are exclusively or
essentially attributable to the geographical environment
in which it is produced, including both natural and
human factors’.34

DOs are products whose characteristics are essen-
tially or exclusively owed to their natural and human
factors, and the production, processing, and pre-
paration of which are carried out within the deﬁned
geographical area. They are the same as AOs accord-
ing to the Lisbon Agreement and also to the EU
PDOs. To take advantage of this disposition, pro-
ducts must be registered.
In both Colombia and
Peru, such registration is granted by the Industrial
Property Ofﬁce.

Indication of Source is the other heading under the
title of GI. Article 221 establishes that these are formed
by the ‘name, expression, image or sign that designates
or evokes a particular country, region, locality or place’.
It does not involve any quality or any other character-
istic of the product but a mere indication of origin.35
This ﬁgure is not to be registered and does not have a
speciﬁc protection of industrial property but may be
protected under competition laws.

Neither TRIPS nor the Lisbon Agreement uses the
term ‘Indication of Source’. The Paris Convention for
the protection of Industrial Property of 188336 and the
Madrid Agreement for the repression of false or decep-
tive indications of source on goods 1891 do mention it,
though neither deﬁnes it.

The Andean Community’s Decision 486 opted to
use the term Denominations of Origin and explained it
with the concept of AOs from the Lisbon Agreement,
which was not signed by three of its members, then
used the term Indication of Source and gave it a
proper concept, never deﬁned before. It is through this
legislation that
its
TRIPS obligation.

the Andean Community fulﬁls

Unfortunately, while the legislation and regime
regarding DOs in the Andean countries is established,

this is not seen in practice because Colombia has regis-
tered only three DOs: ‘cafe´ de Colombia’,37 ‘Cholupa
del Huila’, and ‘Artesanı´a de Guacamayas’. Peru has just
four:
‘Pallar de
Ica’, and ‘Cera´mica de Chulucanas’. Lack of awareness,
economic resources, and local institutional capacity are
said to be the cause.

Readiness to negotiate?
Clearly the EU has a far more developed legislation in
this area and a degree of practice that is moderately
mature. While non-EU members might view this as an
unreasonable advantage, third countries should not be
discouraged from negotiating with the EU since they
can seek to negotiate with other instruments.

What is of concern is whether the Andean countries
understand the degree of GI protection in the EU, and
whether they are ready to comply with the protection
of terms that they do not recognize even in their own
countries (PGIs and TSGs). The degree of imbalance
between the Andean countries and the EU can be seen
from the reports back in March 2010 in the newspapers
reporting the negotiations over GIs.38 These mentioned
that the negotiations covered over 200 European GIs,39
as against the seven registered by Colombia and Peru
between them.

The FTA regarding GIs
The European Commission started talks with the whole
Andean community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and
Peru) in June 2007, when the two blocs opened nego-
tiations on liberalizing trade between them. In late
2008 Bolivia stepped aside, and so did Ecuador in mid-
2009. Colombia and Peru asked the European Commis-
sion for bilateral negotiations,
to which the latter
agreed.40

At the time of the negotiations, one of the most con-
troversial topics was that of IP, including GIs. In June
2009, the parties exchanged their lists of GIs which
were sought to be protected, but no agreement was
reached.41 This was one of the last topics to be closed.
In March 2010, the negotiations ended and the FTA
was signed in May 2010 at the Madrid Summit.

Patricia Covarrubia . Free Trade Agreement on GIs

ARTICLE

335

The content: what is (not) in the FTA?
Certainly, the EU would like some existing trade marks
or generic uses in third countries to be annulled and
repealed, and thus to repatriate those names so that the
original GIs can regain exclusive ownership of their
names. According to the International Trademark
Association, however, it is unlikely that many of the
popular names already trade-marked elsewhere will be
recovered.42

Nevertheless, the EU,

in several recent EU Trade
Agreements (for example with Chile, Australia, Mexico,
and Colombia/Peru), includes a speciﬁc section for GIs
as a way of protecting European products in other jur-
isdictions.43 Because of these bilateral agreements, the
EU is successfully recovering some GI names since they
can no longer be used by other manufacturers, except
those that operate within the GI designation.

Under the FTA between the EU and Colombia and
Peru, Title VII,
Intellectual Property, Article 200,
deﬁnes GIs as ‘indications consisting of the name of a
particular country, region or locality or a name which,
without being that of a particular country, region or
locality, refer to a particular geographical area, and
which identify a product as originating therein where a
given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the
product is exclusively or essentially due to the geo-
graphical environment in which it is produced, with its
inherent natural and human factors’.44

It speciﬁes that the GIs of a party which are to be
protected by the other party shall only be subject to
this Title if they are recognized and declared as such in
the country of origin.45 This implies that the parties
each accept
the other party’s domestic exam-
inations are also sufﬁcient for their domestic market.

that

The FTA ascertains that the parties involved recognize
GIs for agricultural and foodstuff products, wines, spirit
drinks, and aromatized wines, and thus it does not
mention or include manufacturing products. It adds
that other GI products may be protected according to
the laws and regulations applicable to each party.46

The parties acknowledge that the GIs listed under
the Annexes are protected as such in their country of

44 Art 200.1 of the draft FTA between the EU and Colombia/Peru.
45 ibid, Art 200.2.
46 ibid, Art 200.3.
47 The European Commission policy on trade agreements is not to offer the

texts of international agreements before the legal revision. However, a
draft can be found at http://www.bilaterals.org/.

48 The EU has already signed a FTA with Chile in which it grants protection

to ‘Pisco’ as a GI. However, art 207 of the FTA between the EU and

origin. It is noticeable from a reading of the list that
they are indeed protected under the EU GI regime.
However, are these products (in the Annex list) GIs
according to the FTA’s Article 200 deﬁnition? The
answer is no. The deﬁnition given by Article 200
appears to cover only PDOs from the EU and AOs
from the Andean countries; however, Article 200.4
refers to the exclusive use of GIs, stating that ‘use shall
mean the production, and/or processing and/or pre-
paration of the product identiﬁed by the geographical
indication’. Does this mean that PGIs and TSGs are
introduced by the back door? To a great extent, this
can be answered by looking at the list which covers all
GIs protected under the EU regime, namely, PDOs,
PGIs, and TSGs.

The list: discrepancies—do they matter?
The EU uses a highly developed, stand-alone system of
legislation and regulations, while Colombia and Peru
do not. However, both of them protect GIs and they do
not contradict each other.

The FTA speciﬁes the names for protection in Annex
XVII. The draft accessible at this stage contains a note
explaining that ‘this structure is pending the agreement
by Colombia and Peru’.47 The list contains only EU
products (229). In April, however, the EU’s Ofﬁcial
Journal reported that, due to the on-going trade nego-
tiations with Colombia and Peru, the EU was consider-
ing for protection as GIs—and so opening the
objection procedure—the following names:
‘Cholupa
del Huila’ from Colombia, and ‘Pisco’,48 ‘Maı´z Blanco
Gigante Cusco’, and ‘Pallar de Ica’ from Peru.49 Neither
‘Artesanı´a de Guacamayas’ nor ‘Cera´mica de Chuluca-
nas’ was listed. Their absence is presumed to be due to
their being handicrafts and therefore not recognized
under the EU GI regime.

Both parties will open an objection procedure and,
once examined and if no oppositions are brought, the
products will be protected according to the level of
protection laid down in this section.50 While producers
from each party will have an opportunity to oppose a
named GI due to, for example, trade marks rights, the

Colombia and Peru establishes: ‘This section shall not prejudice the rights
that the Parties have already recognised to third countries, by means of
free trade agreements.’

names being generic, and so on, there is no domestic
examination to corroborate that the named GI is truly
a GI. The parties, as explained, appear to have accorded
automatic protection to each other’s GIs.

Since the list includes not only PDOs but also PGIs
and TSGs, Colombia and Peru are recognizing PGIs
and TSGs at the same level as PDOs. Does it matter?
The scope of protection given to an international
product is the same as that given to a national one.
Two situations, however, need to be borne in mind.
First, Decision 486 does not grant a higher protection
to GIs depending on the type but just to wines and
spirits. Accordingly, EU GIs will not enjoy higher
protection as they do in the EU. On the contrary,
Colombia and Peru will enjoy higher protection in
their products.
Secondly, when Colombian and
Peruvian producers notice that it is more difﬁcult to
meet the inherent standards and control criteria of
their national GI regime than the less strict criteria for
EU PGIs (the link between the goods and the soil is
somewhat weaker)51 and TSGs (which do not need a
geographical origin) require, they will certainly see this
as a restriction to their products. There is indeed a
matter of inequality that will bring discomfort to those
Andean nationals.

We must remember that GIs are not only cultural
assets but also business assets. Colombian and Peruvian
producers will not be at ease to see that if their pro-
ducts do not qualify as DOs in their own country but
perhaps may qualify as TSGs under the EU regime,
they will not be protected in their country of origin,
though TSGs from the EU will be protected if they are
in the FTA list, such as ‘Jamo´ n Serrano’. Producers of
Andean countries may feel that they are overtly discri-
minated against under this FTA.

Another point of concern is that, according to
Article 3(1) of TRIPS, each member (in this case the
parties) shall accord to the nationals of other members
(the other party) treatment no less favourable than that
it accords to its own nationals with regard to the pro-
tection of IP. This includes such matters, for example,
as acquisition, scope, maintenance, and enforcement.
While the FTA fulﬁls this Article, it is of interest to see
the contrary, meaning that Colombia and Peru accord
to their own nationals less favourable treatment than
they pact with the EU. The situation is that these two
Andean countries are indeed providing reciprocity but
they are, I believe, making the assumption that all GI
products are of the same level as in their countries,

51 A Jokuti, ‘Where is the what if the what is in why? A rough guide to the

maze of Geographical Indications’ [2009] EIPR 118, 119.

which they are not. A question brought to mind is:
would the EU consider being ﬂexible and accept
Andean-recognized GI handicrafts? The answer is no,
because handicrafts are not recognized as GIs in the
EU. The same, however, could have been said by
Colombia and Peru, that they do not recognize PGIs
and/or certainly, TSGs. Again, producers of Andean
countries may see this as visibly biased.

A higher degree of protection for EU GIs?
As mentioned earlier, the EU would like to see the
elimination of the use of terms such as ‘kind’, ‘type’,
‘style’, and ‘imitation’, which entail similarity to regis-
tered agricultural and foodstuff GIs, for example ‘Pros-
ciutto di Parma style’ or ‘Kalamata type oil’. Decision
486 gives higher protection only to wines and spirits,
so there is just basic protection for those products.

However, the recently drafted FTA between the EU
and Colombia and Peru sets a new type of protection.
Under Article 203.1(b), the FTA establishes that the GIs
listed in the Annex shall be protected at least against:
‘. . . any other non authorized use of geographical indi-
cations other than those identifying wines, aromatized
wines or spirit drinks that creates confusion, including
even in cases where the name is accompanied by indi-
cations such as type, style, imitation and other similar
that creates confusion to the consumer’. It continues,
‘[w]ithout prejudice to this paragraph, if one of the
Parties amends its legislation in order to protect geo-
graphical
than wines, aromatised
wines and spirit drinks to a higher level than what the
present Agreement lays down, it shall extend the said
protection to the geographical indications listed . . .’

indications other

Under the ﬁrst paragraph, there is the idea that pro-
tection is granted to products other than wines and
spirits to a certain level, certainly more than a basic
level but not as high as the EU wishes for. Hence, the
reason for the second paragraph of Article 203.1(b);
the protection is against misleading use—to protect
consumers. To classify as higher protection, it involves
protecting against misuse, imitation, or evocation, even
if the true origin of the product is indicated to ensure
that consumers are not deceived about the nature or
origin of the product, thus protecting the producer as
Article 203.1(c) implies.

The ﬁrst paragraph of Article 203.1(b) does not give
a higher level of protection because it requires con-
fusion. However, those involved in trade mark cases
know that confusion is a thorny matter. It is therefore

questionable how the Andean courts are going to
approach this issue. For example, it may be clear for
some that ‘Parmigiano-Reggiano made in Colombia’
will not confuse the public, but the case will not be so
clear if the name is ‘Parmigiano Reggiano type’. It is
good to bear in mind that the European Court of
Justice has recognized protection to individual terms,52
but this consideration is based on the EU Regulation
510/2006 for agricultural products and foodstuff, which
offers a similar scope protection to that of the wines
and spirits. Colombia and Peru do not grant higher
protection to agricultural and foodstuff; nor does the
FTA indicate that they should do so.

Peru, as part of

its obligation under the Lisbon
Agreement, will grant higher protection, without preju-
dice to the FTA, to some of the products that are listed
in the Annex. Examples are ‘Roquefort’,53 ‘Provolone
Valpadana’,54 and ‘Brie de Meaux’,55 while those EU
members that are parties to the Lisbon Agreement will
do the same for Peru’s products ‘Pisco’56 and ‘Pallar de
Ica’.57 This is because of those products are also regis-
tered at WIPO.58

Scope of protection and enforcement
The ﬁrst difﬁculty for EU producers is to understand
not only the legal framework available but the practice
in the Andean system, and thus the level of protection
that they will enjoy. This is because, while the legal fra-
mework appears to be somehow clear, there is uncer-
tainty about the practice. There is little precedent in
Colombia and Peru regarding GIs. These countries are
at the early stages of fully developing and exercising
their GI regime. In the same vein, EU producers need
to know, for example, if an ex ofﬁcio procedure is avail-
able. If not, EU producers will have to monitor the
foreign market to detect possible abuses by operators
and take all necessary legal actions to assert
their
rights—a costly matter.

On the other side of the coin, the Andean countries
need to bear in mind that there are many situations
that can trigger the protection of different types of GIs

and more, when they are not recognized in their own
jurisdiction. The process can be confusing for prac-
titioners because it is not an easy task fully to under-
stand a new system—different
interpretations are
foreseen. Therefore, lack of experience can bring about
many situations; ﬁrst, the situation of blocking poten-
tial competitors—even though these competitors may
not infringe any GIs. Simply by being accused of such
an infringement, competitors may ﬁnd their goods
seized or destroyed and their commercial and ﬁnancial
networks blocked. This is due to the confusion created
by generic names, counterfeit items, and copy pro-
ducts,59 for example the name ‘Champagne’ for spark-
ling wines made in the USA, where it is considered a
generic name.60 Second, the situation of GI terms com-
posed of more than a single word.

It is unclear whether EU agricultural products and
foodstuff GIs will be protected in Colombia and Peru
against the use of one of the individual terms employ
on its own. For instance, will Cheddar cheese (West
Country farmhouse Cheddar cheese61) and Turro´ n
(Turro´ n de Alicante) be allowed to be free for all to
use? This situation needs careful analysis and under-
standing. In October 2009, for example, when the EU
approached the Chilean Government
to renegotiate
and accept GIs of certain products, mainly cheeses, the
Chilean Association of Exporters of Dairy Products
rejected the EU negotiation because, according to
them, if they were to accept this, Chilean companies
could not sell or export cheese varieties like camem-
bert, brie, and emmental, among others.62 There is
clearly a misconception that needs to be addressed.
What will be protected in Colombia and Peru is
‘Camembert de Normandie’63—not camembert;
‘Brie
de Meaux’64—not the name brie alone; and ‘Allga¨uer
Emmentaler’,65 ‘Emmental de Savoie’,66 and ‘Emmental
franc¸ais est-central’67—not emmental or emental, the
reason being that a higher protection is not provided
in these countries as it is in the EU. Additionally, there
are generic names forming part of the name of the
product which will not be individually protected as
such. However, while it is said that there is not a

higher protection for GIs in agriculture and foodstuff,
Article 203 of the FTA brings some uncertainty as to
the approach that the Andean national courts will take.

for GIs

Positives and negatives
The EU support
sometimes considered
is
questionable, as being protectionist and monopolist. Its
positive side, however, cannot be overlooked because the
GI regime allows regional producers of goods to maxi-
mize both quality and proﬁts on local goods. It is under-
standable that GIs are not for everyone, but the use of IP
to transform community identity into a proﬁtable struc-
ture is neither inherently positive nor negative.68

In the case of the Andean countries, it is expected that,
as their systems evolve, experience and further research
will help them to implement necessary adjustments, to
develop a more complete supporting framework of
inspection, training, and promotion. Nevertheless, most
management of
the GI experience has occurred in
reasonably stable societies such as the EU. Therefore, it is

of great concern to see an FTA covering such an extensive
list of GIs, which is extremely advanced, with two devel-
oping countries that do not have much experience. How
the process will work in these two Andean countries with
less democratically public institutions and less transpar-
ency remains uncertain.69

The FTA on GIs demands new commitments on
the Andean part. However,
this can be seen as a
positive if it brings principles to those countries in
justice and innovative reforms
the search for social
to increase opportunities
the rural poor and
their organizations.

for

Finally, economically and culturally, GI protection
is becoming an increasingly important issue for pro-
ducers and an important element of their develop-
ment strategy. Thus GIs should be promoted as one
of the main strategies for Andean countries because
they are rich in traditional knowledge, agriculture,
foodstuff, and handicraft. However, since in the FTA
itself the measure appears to be imbalanced,70 litiga-
tion seems imminent.
