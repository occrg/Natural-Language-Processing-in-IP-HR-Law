Authorship, ownership, wikiship: copyright
in the twenty-first century
Jeremy Phillips*

Roadmap
This article starts by contrasting approaches to copy-
right law that are driven by the contemplation of gen-
eralities with those that are shaped by study of speciﬁc
situations that may not comply with those generalities.
Then, taking the wiki as its paradigm,
it seeks to
explain what a wiki is, whether it is even an apt subject
for copyright law as we understand it in the European
Union and whether it is additionally a subject of the
law that governs sui generis database right. There follow
some brief exercises in identifying questions that must
be answered when identifying the author for copyright
purposes, in examining the applicability of moral rights
to wiki contributors. Finally, the article asks whether
the European Commission
the apparent silence of
regarding the legal status of the wiki
is a positive
silence or a negative one, concluding with a review of
consensual solutions as a means of avoiding legal
battles surrounding the uncertainty of the wiki’s status.
this article is speculative.
There is no rich tapestry of European national litiga-
tion or scholarly writing to which reference may be
made and such controversies as wikis have generated
have been led more by issues of accuracy of content
and of political control than by considerations relating
to IP. Like the elephant at the breakfast table, Wikipe-
dia is so vast an enterprise that it cannot be ignored.
This article, while mentioning it where appropriate, has
proceeded on the basis that Wikipedia is just one
among many wikis and that its unique and tantalizing
characteristics are not shared by most others of its
genre.

Key issues
† The statement is often made that copyright law
looks backwards,
towards its historical roots,
while the works that are protected by it are
framed within technologies that were unknown
when the law was conceived.

† Do old laws serve new situations well, or do new
situations cause unexpected, unpredicted,
ten-
sions that are difﬁcult to resolve? These questions
may be posed both in theoretical terms and in
the light of current market practices.

† Taking the recent phenomenon of the wiki as its
paradigm, this article examines the application of
copyright and database rights to the ownership
and authorship of multi-authored ‘works in pro-
gress’, highlighting some of the problems that
exist in theory, whether they cause difﬁculty in
practice or not.

The tranquil and the turbulent
Viewed at a respectable distance, what we call copyright
appears to be a long-established set of rules, canonized
by time,
space, and long-accepted practice. Three
hundred years have passed since copyright metamor-
phosed from a series of ad hoc grants into a regular stat-
utory regime of entitlement.1 A century and a quarter
have elapsed since the stately concord of great imperial
powers led to the signing of the Berne Convention
on which the sun never set.2 And, like the inexorable,
scarcely perceptible passage of time as recorded on the

face of an atomic clock, the invisible process of conclud-
ing copyright licences, assignments, and royalty distri-
butions has guaranteed an ever-ﬂowing, never-ending
procession of movies at the cinema, soaps on television,
books in stores, piped muzak in public spaces, and the
cheerful chirruping of a hundred thousand ringtones.

The reality is entirely different. There is no science
today in which the view from a respectable distance is
worth a second glance—unless there is a science in the
making of distant, uninformed generalizations. The
ﬁelds of human activity to which copyright is relevant
are virtually all-embracing. For this reason, both the
making of generalizations as to how copyright works
and the establishment of broad principles that may be
of equal applicability throughout those ﬁelds of activity
have become increasingly challenging tasks.

Because of the degree of diversity of the ﬁelds of
activity to which copyright is relevant, we must all now
become specialists; our education and our expertise is
the microscope through which we contemplate, identify,
and analyse the teeming life forms that interact in an
unending cycle of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.3 From
a comfortable distance, copyright is a limpid, tranquil
pool; when inspected at close range, it is a medium in
which teeming life forms rage at one another, build alli-
ances, or die or are destroyed, while all the time absorb-
ing one another’s energies and frenetic, original output.

The tensions and the turbulence that characterize
copyright today provide an excuse, if any were needed,
for the constant revisiting by scholars and practitioners of
issues that are so fundamental that laymen are surprised
to discover that they need a second thought. The baker
does not anguish over the meaning of ﬂour or water
before he prepares his pastry. Nor does the builder
trouble himself as to the concepts of ‘brick’, ‘mortar’, or
‘plaster’ when he constructs a wall. Yet, 300 years after the
so-called birth of copyright, IP lawyers still argue about
the identity and the meaning of the concepts they invoke
when addressing even the simplest issues. ‘Is the legal
right property characterized as copyright or author’s

right?’; ‘Is the subject of copyright protected because of
what it is, or because it is the result of one of a number of
speciﬁc processes?’; ‘What, if anyone (or anything), is an
author?’; and ‘Who owns the allegedly protected work?’

These questions do not exist in a vacuum. They are
a sort of multiple-choice catechism that must be
recited on each occasion on which one contemplates
the application of existing laws and principles to a new
medium, or to a new way of manipulating an old
medium, through which an actually or allegedly pro-
tected work may be communicated or on which it may
be recorded. One of the ﬁrst such media to be con-
sidered this century is that of the wiki.4

This article puts the wiki under the microscope, not
with a view to providing answers to the questions relat-
ing to authorship, ownership, and control of a new
species of work that generates legal consequences—
since the answers will vary from jurisdiction to juris-
diction in accordance with local copyright laws and
contractual and delictual obligations. Rather,
this
article seeks to ask questions,
framing them where
possible within a European Union context, as to what
species of beast the wiki is.

What is a wiki?
The word ‘wiki’
is not a legal term of art. For the
purpose of this article, it may be understood as meaning
‘a website or similar online resource which allows users
to add and edit content collectively’.5 The growth of the
popularity of the wiki as a means of recording, verifying,
correcting, and communicating information has been a
prominent feature of a phenomenon often termed ‘Web
2.0’. Again, Web 2.0 is not a term of art—and there are
some who doubt its existence6—but for the purposes of
this article that term may be understood as referring to

a perceived second generation of web-based communities
and hosted services—such as social-networking sites, wikis,
and folksonomies—which aim to facilitate creativity, col-
laboration, and sharing between users.7

4 According to the entry on wikis in Wikipedia, the ﬁrst wiki was installed

as long ago as 1995 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki, accessed 24
January 2008). However, so far this century, the wiki has received very
little attention from writers in Europe. For example, the article of S
Stokes’ enjoyable Digital Copyright Law and Practice (Hart, Oxford, 2nd
edn, 2005) which deals with copyright and internet technology has no
reference to the wiki. The same is true of F Gotzen (ed.), The Future of

Intellectual Property in the Global Market of the Information Society: Who
is Going to Shape the IPR System in the New Millennium? (Bruylant,
Brussels, 2003), P Akester, A Practical Guide to Digital Copyright Law
(Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2008) as well as the other works cited

ARTICLE

As viewed by readers and those who participate in its
compilation, a wiki
is generally perceived as a two-
dimensional, screen-based phenomenon. The screen
display is, however, the result of the summoning-up of
all or more usually part of a record that consists
entirely of an electronic record hosted on a computer
disk or other storage medium.

The wiki lies at the opposite end of the spectrum
from the establishment of a digital rights management
(DRM) scheme,8 even though secure, access-limiting
software may be found in the structure of each. DRM
employs its secure software in order to control the
nature and extent of a copyright-protected work when
it delivers it to the ultimate consumer, whereas the wiki
employs its software in order to deliver a work’s evol-
utionary accessibility to present and future authors
who may be, but need not be, its consumers too.

No reliable estimate exists as to how many wikis are in
use or as to their actual or theoretical market value. It has
been asserted that 50 per cent of corporations will be
using wikis as ‘work collaboration tools’ by 2009,9 as a
means of facilitating cooperation by home-workers in pro-
jects that will keep fuel costs down while keeping retire-
ment-age workers active. Since we are still at the stage in
the wiki’s evolution in which many journalists have only
just stumbled upon it and write on the topic on the basis
that members of the public have no knowledge of it at all,
it may be assumed that the amount of hard fact concern-
ing wiki penetration remains small for the time being.

Is copyright the appropriate
right in a wiki?
This article does not propose to revisit
the long-
running discussion as to whether the right that links a
creator with his creation is properly termed a ‘copy-
right’ or an ‘author’s right’.10 Within the context of the
wiki, this debate has some meaning.

Because it is not a copy of another work itself and
consists of content that is capable of being copied—
and which in an appropriate case may well be copied—
it ﬁts the description of an original
literary work
within the traditional framework of the common law
view of copyright. Without struggling to analyse the
issues of authorship too closely, the common lawyer is
apt to recognize that the wiki is a typical case of ‘if it’s
worth copying, it’s worth protecting’.11

A lawyer in the civilian tradition of the author’s
right, while conceding that a wiki may bear some
outward trappings of an author’s work, will pay par-
ticular attention to its manner of creation. Is it the
embodiment,
in some tangible or at least recorded
form, of the author’s will? If so, it is the original crea-
tive act of the author that drives the justiﬁcation for
conferring legal protection. It is on this basis that civi-
lian traditions have found it possible to confer protec-
tion of author’s right on perfumes and scents,12 while
hesitating to protect the lists of factual data13 and, at
ﬁrst, even computer programs.14

But if the civil law ﬁnds merit in the author’s act of
creation, he may baulk from protecting the wiki once
he fully appreciates its synthetic nature. A large multi-
contributor work may be a reﬂection of no speciﬁc and
identiﬁable individual at all. It may be more like a
large, accessible wall upon which each of a lengthy pro-
cession of passers-by has written a few words, a sort of
literary coral reef that has come into being through the
gradual accretion of a myriad of words, its shape and
character being determined at any given moment by
the nature of the most recent of those accretions which
have obscured the foundation of the earlier contri-
butions upon which they have alighted: it is a work
that can be copied, but is it truly a work of authorship
in any meaningful sense?

Without attempting to resolve this debate, modern
European IP law has imposed further legal superstructures.

One of these superstructures seeks to resolve or bypass
the old copyright/author’s right debate by suggesting
that protection should be imposed at a higher and
more general level than that of protecting the textual
context of a wiki. The other ﬂies below the radar of
copyright/author’s right, by pointing to the aggregation
of
the
authorial
integrity of the whole, as the appropriate
point at which protection should be brought to bear.15
Both of these legal superstructures, confusingly, go by
the
right—and both were
brought into contemporary national law16 by the same
instrument, the so-called Database Directive.17

items of content, rather than at

same name—database

individual

In brief, the Database Directive provided for two
rights. The ﬁrst is copyright; the second is a sui generis
right which, though similar to copyright to the point at
which the same legal provisions may apply in parallel
to each of copyright and the sui generis right, is mani-
festly different from it in conceptual, practical, and
commercial terms. Each of the two rights introduced
by the Directive is a right in relation to a database, so
the deﬁnition of ‘database’ represents a common point
of departure for further discussion and comparison of
these rights as they relate to the wiki.

The Database Directive deﬁnes ‘database’ as ‘a col-
lection of independent works, data, or other materials
arranged in a systematic or methodical way and indivi-
dually accessible by electronic or other means’.18 This
deﬁnition may apply to a wiki and, it is submitted, will
generally do so, but need not do so in every case. A
wiki that is a compilation of separate contributions will
always be capable of being viewed as a ‘database’ unless
the contributions are in the form of small, incremental
changes and additions to a textual matrix that cannot
be described as ‘independent’ since they cannot stand
alone and are only given meaning or context by the
wiki content that surrounds them.

The wiki as copyright work
Now that the term ‘database’ has been deﬁned, and it
that a wiki may—and generally will—fall
appears
within its scope,
let us see what the Directive says
about the extent to which a database is protected under
the law of copyright. Article 3 explains what precisely is

15 The uncomfortable relationship between copyright and author’s right

traditions at the point of potential overlap between traditional copyright
subject matter and the sui generis database right is illuminated by reading
J Adams, ‘Originality in Copyright: A Solution to the Database Problem?’
in P Torremans (ed.), Copyright Law: A Handbook of Contemporary
Research (Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2007).

16 No provision was made for a pan-European database right analogous to

the pan-European unregistered design right introduced into European

protected, and Article 4 determines who is entitled
initially to enjoy the beneﬁt of that protection:

Article 3
Object of protection
. . . databases which, by reason of the selection or
1.
arrangement of their contents, constitute the author’s
own intellectual creation shall be protected as such by
copyright. No other criteria shall be applied to deter-
mine their eligibility for that protection.
2. The copyright protection of databases provided for
by this Directive shall not extend to their contents and
shall be without prejudice to any rights subsisting in
those contents themselves.
Article 4
Database authorship
1. The author of a database shall be the natural person
or group of natural persons who created the base or,
where the legislation of the Member States so permits,
the legal person designated as the rightholder by that
legislation.
2. Where collective works are recognized by the legis-
lation of a Member State, the economic rights shall be
owned by the person holding the copyright.
3. In respect of a database created by a group of natural
persons jointly, the exclusive rights shall be owned jointly.

simultaneously those

From Article 3, we immediately see that the European
Parliament and the Council have sided both with the
civilians and with the commoners. The database is a
work of ‘the author’s own individual creation’, a term
which strikingly emphasizes the primacy of the human
creative imperative as the justiﬁcation for conferring
legal protection. Yet
august
bodies, in directing the legislative drift of their neo-
phyte subject matter, steer their attention away from a
work of creative authorship and focus instead upon
what is effectively the work of tidy ofﬁce management:
the arrangement of something even as trivially uncre-
ated as raw data, in a systematic or methodical manner
by means of which each piece of data is individually
accessible. This is to bestow the title ‘author’ on the
street-sweeper who brushes facts into tidy piles of data
all along the information highway.

More to the point, on the assumption that the nor-
mative publicly accessible and communally amendable
wiki is generally a ‘database’ under Article 1, we can
substitute ‘wiki’ for ‘database’ and re-read Article 3 as

Union law by Council Regulation 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on
Community Designs.

17 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11

March 1996 on the legal protection of databases.

stating that ‘wikis which, by reason of the selection or
arrangement of their contents, constitute the author’s
own intellectual creation shall be protected as such by
copyright’.

Now we have a problem. Many people may contrib-
ute to a wiki as it metamorphoses from one content-
form to the next. If each contributor’s addition is
included in the wiki as a whole by virtue of ‘the reason
of the selection or arrangement of the wiki’s contents’,
does that mean that the work is a protectable database?
Both the
language and its mode of
expression are clumsy and unclear to the English
reader, but it looks as though we have a sort of reason-
ing that runs like this:

conceptual

(i) There exists a database (within the meaning of

Article 1);

(ii) The database constitutes the author’s own intellec-

tual creation;

(iii) The reason why the database constitutes

the
author’s own intellectual creation is because he has
selected or arranged its contents;

(iv) Because the author has created the database by
selecting or arranging the contents, the database is
entitled to copyright protection;

(v) Copyright protection of the database does not
extend to the contents selected or arranged, since
it does not depend on the ‘content of the con-
tents’ but does depend on the fact of their selec-
tion or arrangement that is accessible by electronic
or other means.

This at least tells us that the subject of protection of a
wiki that is a ‘database’ is the product that results from
the intellectual creation that has been employed in
making it a matrix to which information may be added
and from which information can be retrieved.

The scope of protection accorded to a database
suggests, however, that what is protected is not merely
the result of the intellectual creative act of an author,
but the content of the database itself. Thus Article 5
reads:

Restricted acts
In respect of the expression of the database which is
protectable by copyright, the author of a database shall
have the exclusive right to carry out or to authorize:
(a) temporary or permanent
means and in any form, in whole or in part;

reproduction by any

(b) translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other
alteration;
(c) any form of distribution to the public of the data-
base or of copies thereof. . . . ;
(d) any communication, display, or performance to the
public;
(e) any reproduction, distribution,
communication,
display or performance to the public of the results of
the acts referred to in (b).

In this respect, there is an analogy between the pro-
tection of a wiki as a database under copyright and
the protection of a ‘compilation’ as a literary work:19
an author may exercise his creative intelligence in
arranging a group of individual works within a par-
ticular scheme, even though he was the author of
none of those individual works, but his copyright in
the compilation may be infringed, and thus enforce-
able by him, when a series of items within the compi-
lation are put together in the same manner in the
course of carrying out an act
restricted by his
copyright.

The wiki as sui generis work
The Database Directive provides a lower level of pro-
tection than copyright in respect of the database qua
compilation of data rather than as qua original intellec-
tual creation. This substratum of protection most cer-
tainly recognizes
the common law philosophy of
providing protection on the basis that the object of
protection is worth copying, rather than recognizing
the merit of any intellectual skill or self-expression on
the part of a creator. It is not a registered right, like the
patent, trade mark, or design;
it is not a copyright
either. Aptly is it named the sui generis right, since it is
unlike any regular IP right, being at best an unloved
bastard child of the Nordic catalogue rule, fertilized
in a test-tube of the European Commission’s policy
laboratory.20

What is the subject matter of sui generis protection?

Article 7 of the Directive explains:

Object of protection
1. . . . a database which shows that there has been quali-
tatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in
either the obtaining, veriﬁcation or presentation of the
contents . . . .
4. . . . paragraph 1 shall apply irrespective of the eligi-
bility of that database for protection by copyright or by

triggering events:

This subject matter is protected;
it appears not on
account of the intellectual creativity so beloved of the
civil law tradition, but solely on account of one of the
three meritorious
in
obtaining,
investment in verifying, or investment in
presenting. No matter that this simple formula has
been interpreted into near oblivion, having been
dragged through an impenetrable thicket of intellectual
overkill and hyper-rationalization by a Court of Justice
that has demonstrated an absolute absence of empathy
with the subtle world of IP commerce:21 the words of
the Directive clearly express an intention to protect a
subject matter that consists of (i) an investment which
is made in (ii) a non-authorial act that adds value or
substance to (iii) a database.

What does this mean for the wiki? Again, on the
premise that almost all wikis are databases, we can sub-
stitute the word ‘wiki’ for ‘database’ in Article 7 and
read it as protecting ‘. . . a wiki which shows that there
has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substan-
tial investment in either the obtaining, veriﬁcation or
presentation of the contents . . .’.

Unlike the previously discussed database copyright
conferred under Article 4, the sui generis database right
does not require an act of creativity on the part of an
author, so there is no need to identify the author. The
sui generis right only requires that there be a ‘maker’.
This constructive but non-creative entity is not deﬁned
within the Directive’s substantive provisions, but it is
understood by Recital 41 of the Preamble as

the person who takes the initiative and the risk of invest-
ing; . . . this excludes subcontractors in particular from the
deﬁnition of maker.22

This deﬁnition separates the term of art ‘maker’—the
initiator and risk-taker—from the actual maker, the
person or persons who assemble the ‘collection of inde-
pendent works, data, or other materials arranged in a

systematic or methodical way and individually accessible
by electronic or other means’ which the Directive pro-
tects. Applied to the wiki, the contributor of content
does not, however great his contribution in qualitative
or quantitative terms, become its ‘maker’
in legal
terms—even if he contributes its entire content and is
the provider of the intellectually creative spark that
vests copyright
in the database under Article 3—
because he is not the risk-taker and the initiator of the
database as a commercial venture.

Is a wiki also a conventional
non-database copyright work?
In terms of its general outward appearance, a wiki may
be described as a work that is composed of convention-
al alphanumeric symbols and that bears the outward
trappings of conventional literary work. To date, wikis
have been populated, amended, and updated by infor-
mation supplied through individual manual interven-
tion by authors, so they would appear to conform to
the archetype of a multi-authored work.

While human agency through the act of creative
authorship is presently the norm, there is no technical
reason why a wiki should not be amenable to develop-
ment amendment by purely mechanical and automated
means, such as through the operation of a computer
program that replaces existing data with fresh data
(such as the substitution of the renumbered provisions
of statutes, of married names in place of single names,
or of the names of countries or cities that have recast
themselves in non-colonial mode). The refreshing of
Wikipedia content is itself the product of automatic
routine editing, both through ‘assisted editing’—where
an individual editor uses programs that assist the prep-
aration of his individual edits—and through the cease-
less patrolling of Wikipedia content by robots (‘bots’)
that correct grammar and syntax, substitute links, and
restore the effects of vandalism.23 Where mechanical
amendment goes so far as to generate content that may
be objectively identiﬁable as a prima facie protected
subject matter of copyright in its own right, some juris-
dictions already recognize that copyright may be gener-
ated by a work that cannot be traced to an act of
human authorship.24

Who is the author?
The concept of authorship and the identiﬁcation of
one or more authors are subjects that have generated a
large and vibrant literature.25 What they have not yet
generated, however, is an ofﬁcially recognized consen-
sus within the European Union as to who an author is
or as to whether the author or some other party is
entitled to be regarded as the legal owner of the copy-
right (whether initially, on account of the third party’s
status, or following the operation of a rule of law that
divests the author of his entitlement as owner at the
moment when the work is created).

The term ‘author’ is left open for national govern-
ments to determine, since the term is not deﬁned
under international
law or under any instrument of
European Union law—with one apparent exception. In
respect of copyright in an original and creative data-
base, Article 4 of Directive 96/9 deﬁnes ‘author’ as

the natural person or group of natural persons who
created the base or, where the legislation of the Member
States so permits, the legal person designated as the right-
holder by that legislation.

This exception is not, then, a true exception, since it is
not so much a deﬁnition as a facilitation: the legisla-
tures of the respective Member States are vested with
the option to designate as the author of a database—
which the wiki may very well be—the natural person(s)
who created the wiki, the employer of such person(s),
an independent party by whom the wiki was commis-
sioned, or the cat in the tree.

Leaving aside the issue of authorship of a copyright-
protected database in wiki format, let us now consider
the authorship of the contents that are written and
posted into the corpus of
the wiki’s content. The
concept of ‘joint authorship’ is highly relevant to the
wiki, since the technical possibility exists that any given
piece of wiki text will be worked and reworked by
several authors with the result that the individual con-
tribution of each cannot be detected. Joint authorship,
however, raises problems of its own. Where A writes a
literary work and posts it on the wiki on Monday, B
makes substantial changes in it on Tuesday, and C,
unaware of the earlier text, changes it back on Wednesday

25 For a broad survey of legal, economic, and philosophical approaches to

the concept of authorship, embracing both common law and civil law
traditions, see L Zemer, The Idea of Authorship in Copyright (Ashgate,
Aldershot, 2007) and the sources cited there.

27 By mid-January 2008, the number of contributors to Wikipedia had

exceeded 75,000, making it what is almost certainly the largest currently

to the form in which A originally posted it, the author-
ship of the ﬁnal version of the text is open to debate.
The casual reader on Monday, revisiting the same wiki
page on Thursday, may have no idea that the appar-
ently identical text has been the subject of three author-
ial acts. A will be surprised to hear of C’s claim to be
the author of a piece of text which, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, he believes he has written.
And what of poor B, whose authorial contribution to
the dynamic of the living, ever-changing text has been,
as it were, written out of the script, but whose contri-
bution was
triggered the
authorial act of C?

the causative event

that

Given the uncertainties regarding the identity of the
author, and of identifying the nature and extent of his
authorial contribution to what is generally a ‘work in
progress’ that is always in ﬂux, never static, the extreme
position taken by Lior Zemer is
instance
remarkably attractive. Zemer writes:

in this

I advocate the authorial role of the public in the process of
copyright creation. This role has been largely ignored and
taken for granted. I take the temerity to introduce and
develop a socio-legal argument suggesting a property right
for the public in every copyrighted enterprise.26

In the case of a popular wiki such as Wikipedia itself,
as the number of contributors continues to surge27 and
the signiﬁcance of the identity of each individual con-
tributor continues to diminish, one almost senses that
this example is made for Zemer’s thesis.28

Where does the act of authorship take place?
National copyright law works best, and is easiest to
apply, in terms of single instances of creation: this is
because the principles from which our present law has
been formed are principles which were themselves
directed towards the protection of a single work, created
at one point in time, by a single author. More complex
scenarios are recognized to exist and one of them—the
creation of a single work by more than one author—is
addressed through a simple rule: if the contributions of
the respective authors can be separately identiﬁed in the
ﬁnal work, then they are treated as separate works in
each of which a separate copyright exists. The contri-
butions of the respective authors may not, however, be

continuously authored work in the world. The current ﬁgure can be
checked on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About.

28 Zemer has adopted the retro-approach of the legal scholar, seeking a
foundation for his thesis in the writings of John Locke. Although the
book was published in 2007, it addresses and criticizes the notion of the
model in the traditional author – publisher – public –purchaser paradigm.
The terms ‘cyberspace’, ‘internet’, Web 2.0’, and ‘wiki’ will not be found in

meaningfully unscrambled, certainly where their origins
cannot be identiﬁed at all and possibly also where,
though each is identiﬁed, it is only by virtue of their
aggregation that the combined result constitutes a pro-
tected work at all. In such a case, the work is taken to be
a work of joint and inseparable authorship; both the
incidents of ownership and the duration of protection
take this inseparability into account.

But the law has not developed with equal conﬁdence
into other areas of complexity. For example, what
happens where a work is apparently a work of joint
authorship as described in the previous paragraph, but
the authors have composed their respective authorial
contributions in different countries? This is a common
occurrence where wikis are concerned, since the inter-
net is no respecter of national boundaries and the
fusion of creative inputs into a single work with a wide
international readership and writership (such as Wiki-
pedia itself) is an extremely common event. Since there
is no harmonization of legal rules deﬁning authorship
within the European Union or beyond it, it is easy to
postulate the existence of a work in which the authorial
contributions of A, B, and C are combined,
these
august authors being resident in EU Member States X,
Y, and Z. Under the law of country X, it appears that
the work is a work of joint authorship and that A, B,
and C are the joint authors. Under the law of country
Y, the original work as posted by A is regarded as a
work of single authorship in which A owns the copy-
right, the view being taken that the contributions of B
and C are insufﬁcient
their
respective additions to be regarded as original. Under
the law of country Z, the contribution of B is regarded
as insubstantial, but the result of C’s further amend-
ment is to create not a work of joint authorship but
two separate works in which the contributions of A
and C are identiﬁable. Is it the law of country of X, Y,
or Z that applies to the issues of authorship and own-
ership? Or should it be the law of the USA where, it
transpires, the wiki was hosted?

The author and moral rights
In addition to the so-called ‘economic rights’ that deter-
mine the ability of their owner to control at least in part
the manner in which his copyright is exploited in the
market—whether the market is a real one for a commer-
cial product or a hypothetical one for a work that is
never meant to be traded—there also exists a set of

‘paternity’

‘moral rights’. These rights link the author to the work
on the basis of his association with that work through
an act of creativity. Being entirely personal
in their
nature, these rights may be waived but not assigned in
the course of trade. The principal moral rights are
† the right to be identiﬁed as the author of one’s work
(even in an age of political correctness the metaphor
is employed to describe this right,
of
regardless of the gender of the author);
† the right to object to the making by others of altera-
tions to the work that cause the author some loss or
damage by virtue of his being known as author of
the work as altered;
† the right to determine when the work is indeed con-
cluded as a work and not merely some preparatory
draft or model from which the ultimate work will be
distilled;
† the right to resile from any form of exploitation of
the work that the author considers to be inappropri-
ate or undesirable.29

The application of moral rights principles to the creation
of wikis is fraught with difﬁculties. At this early junc-
ture, we can identify at least the following problems:
† Just as there is a difference of approach as between
copyright and author’s right systems when it comes
to the identiﬁcation of appropriate subject matter
for protection through the exercise of economic
rights, a similar difference is reﬂected in the identiﬁ-
cation of that which constitutes a work for moral
rights. We do not yet know whether the two tra-
ditions would treat the wiki in like fashion or split
over the need to protect the identity and moral
integrity of its authors;30
† The authorship of a contribution to a wiki may be
apparent, as where the wiki
is the product of a
single, named individual. It may also be the product
of a single but unnamed individual or of a multi-
plicity of named or named individuals. The circum-
stances pertinent to each may govern the extent to
which the right of paternity can be said to be appli-
cable, if at all. In the UK, if a multi-authored wiki is
published in a ‘collective work of reference’, no right
to be attributed as the author even of an identiﬁed
and unamended part of it even exists;31
† In the UK, the right to be known as the author of a
work must be ‘asserted’ in accordance with a web of

29 Sometimes termed the droit de repentir (right to repent).

suitable for moral rights protection, see S Teilmann, ‘Justiﬁcations for

statutory detail before it may be enforced. If a wiki
is not excluded from the scope of this right because
it is not found to be a ‘collective work of reference’
it is still unclear what precisely the author of an
original or amending part of a wiki must do in
order to be said to have asserted his right;
† a wiki to which a multiplicity of authors have access
to editorial rights raises problems regarding the
possible waiver of the right to object to distortions
and mutilations and, to the contrary, the possible
implication of a common understanding among the
authors that no such non-consensual amendment
shall be made;
† it may be questioned whether any person, on
reading a multi-authored wiki, would necessarily
assume that an attribution of the name of an author,
in relation to an entry, creates an implication that
the work thus attributed is indeed the sole and una-
mended work of the named author;
† the wiki provides a perfect medium for conﬂicting
‘freedom of expression’ claims by the author who
objects the given amendment and the author who
seeks to impose it;32

is conventionally accepted that mere editorial
amendments such as the correction of a spelling or
the repunctuation of a sentence are not prohibited
as being in conﬂict with the author’s moral rights,
but it is unknown whether that acceptance is equally
operative in the case of wikis or whether, if it is so
operative, to what extent;
† the right to determine when a work is complete of
uncertain relevance and scope in the context of a
typical multi-authored wiki;
† the right of withdrawal, probably the least signiﬁcant
moral right in the context of traditional exploitation
of copyright works, paradoxically becomes the most
signiﬁcant moral right in the context of the wiki,
where a work may be of only temporary or ephem-
eral interest and the author may have a pressing and
continuing need to change his posted text or with-
draw it completely from its wiki host.33

Freedom of Expression’, in F Macmillan (ed.), New Directions in

33 A work may be withdrawn from a wiki, but it never really disappears: its

electronic footprint will remain in cyberspace, held by one or more of the
private sector facilities that traps and preserves old versions of current

sometimes characterized as moral rights, are by deﬁ-
nition not rights held by the author qua author. Two
such rights are of clear relevance to the wiki:
† the right to object to the false attribution of author-
ship, this being a right that is exercised by a non-
author who has been mislabelled as the author of a
work;
† the right of a person who has commissioned the cre-
ation of a portrait to control or prohibit the display,
reproduction, distribution, or performance of any
other restricted act by the owner of the copyright in
the portrait.

Logically it appears that in any situation in which an
author objects to the distortion or mutilation of a work
which he has written, that author can assert both his
moral right as the author of the work in its original
form and his pseudo-moral right as the non-author of
the objectionable form into which his work has been
metamorphosed.

A view from HQ: do the European
Union’s organs have anything to tell us?
As mentioned above, the terms ‘Web 2.0’ and ‘wiki’ are
not terms of art. No reference will therefore be found
to them in any European Union primary or secondary
legislation. Even the now ubiquitous term ‘internet’, the
means by which the wiki is accessed and promulgated,
is not employed in any European Union copyright-
related or information society legislation. European law
is expressed to be compliant with the so-called WIPO
Internet Treaties, neither of which contains the word
‘internet’.

This silence is consonant with one or more of a
number of states:

principle of law which is in need of amendment or
adjustment in the wiki age;
† a situation in which the investigation of the present

What battle?
At the time of writing, the wiki is still awaiting its ﬁrst
European copyright and/or sui generis database right
cause ce´le`bre. No accusation of wiki infringement, theft,
or plagiarism has yet been heard in court; no writ has
ﬂown; no statements of
indignation or
injured righteousness have hit the headlines of the
popular press; no trainee lawyer, in the stillness of the
data room, has struggled with the categorization and
classiﬁcation of rights-holders’ interests; no commercial
conference organizer has sent forth brightly coloured
advertisements bearing strident statements that this is
the Age of the Wiki, in which no client will wish to
instruct a legal adviser who has not been extensively
trained to solve the complexities of wiki authorship
and ownership. Can it be that the wiki, like the multi-
media CD, will come and even go without leaving
more than a trace of commercial conﬂict in its wake?

In truth, ancient human skills such as the grant of
licences and the consensual resolution of actual or
potential conﬂict will do much to keep the wiki’s many
stakeholders out of court. Thus, taking the currently
popular Wikipedia as an example, we note that, by
uploading textual content on to that wiki, each contri-
butor agrees to licence the public under the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL),34 without geographi-
cal limit, to use that contribution without the need to
seek permission, provided that a principle of recipro-
city applies which confers the same entitlement
to
others and that, where the fruits of that licensed use
are made available online, such use links readers of
the material used back to its Wikipedia source.35

such as

this offers comfort and
An arrangement
security to the would-be user or licensee, except that it
is not unknown for standard terms of use to change
over the course of time: a user of wiki content will not
want to be told that, whatever blandishments appear
on the wiki’s statement of content use, it may be the
terms that existed at the date upon which that content
was uploaded, not the date on which he seeks to use it,
that determine his relationship with one or more copy-
right owner.

If a would-be user of wiki content cannot comply
with accessible and publicized conditions relating to
the copying, transmission, or other use of its contents,
he must seek out the author (or authors) of the wiki
entry which he wishes to use, so that they may be
invited to give their consent to use outside those con-
ditions. Identiﬁcation of
the appropriate author or
authors of original and subsequently amended content
may be through an explicit naming protocol or
through the use of software that backtracks and allows
the unravelling of wiki content, layer by layer. But life
is short, copyright clearance routines are tedious, and
the risk of any individual act of infringement ending in
litigation (or even pricking the modern conscience)
must be close to inﬁnitesimal.

The licensing of works under the Creative Commons
scheme is not yet wiki-friendly, insofar as it presup-
poses the existence of single, static work which can be
identiﬁed as having their authorship and content which
is to all intents and purposes immutable. The adap-
tation of that scheme, so as to avoid doubt in cases
where no copyright protection claim is likely to be
made or where a work is plainly dedicated to the
public domain, should not greatly exercise the creative
talents of the copyright lawyer.

Where battles will remain to be fought are those situ-
ations in which consensus is impossible to obtain, where
moral rights of identiﬁable authors are traversed and
where the terms of consent to otherwise unauthorized
use are abused or ignored. In such situations, where the
integrity of the single European market for goods and
services is not obviously at stake and where there is no
overriding imperative that demands the harmonization
of national laws within the European Union’s component
Member States, it may be predicted that the European
Parliament and the Commission will not intervene. If

GFDl. Wikipedia itself recognizes that this is unclear because the GFDL

the creation of a clear and stable legal framework for

Organization itself. At the time of writing this article,

that is not an imminent occurrence, nor even a likely
