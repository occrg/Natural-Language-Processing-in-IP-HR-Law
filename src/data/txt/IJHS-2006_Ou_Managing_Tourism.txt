Space tourism has become a reality and is bound to become ever more affordable. It is now
time to spend serious thought on how humanity is going to manage the human material
culture and heritage sites on the surface of the Moon. After all, the Apollo XI mission is of
global human significance inasmuch as it was the first time a human being set foot on
another  celestial  body.  Environmental  conditions  on  the  Moon  are  such  that  what  is
considered low-impact visitation on Earth would have devastating consequences for the
heritage on the lunar surface. This paper highlights a range of issues, not the least of these
being management in an environment without territorial control, neither physically nor
legally. The multinational management of Antarctica is proposed as a model for the lunar
surface.

There are defining events in everyone’s personal life, and there are defining events in a
nation’s history that occur during a lifetime. Examples are the shooting of President
John F. Kennedy on 22 November 1963 and the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November
1989.  But,  as  can  be  argued,  these  events  are  significant  only  for  a  generation  and,
moreover, only for a segment of the world’s population.

But then there are those events that define, consciously or subconsciously, a large
part of humanity, irrespective of generations, ethnicity and creed. The human world
changed irrevocably on 20 July 1969. An estimated 600 million people, about one-fifth
of  the  world’s  population  at  the  time,  watched  the  live  television  broadcast  as  Neil

Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface.1 For the first time, humans had set foot on
another celestial object—and not just any celestial object: it was the Moon, the depend-
able, yet enigmatic, companion of the night sky.



Technological  advances  accelerating  throughout  the  20th  century  allowed  greater
access to places previously thought to be beyond our reach, provoking a belief in our
ability to accomplish anything. The 1969 Apollo XI mission to the Moon was a crystal-
lising factor. Consider how often we use the phrase ‘if we can put a [hu]man on the
Moon, why can’t we …?’

The Heritage of the Space Race

The Apollo XI mission was the culmination of a race between the USA and the (then)
USSR for supremacy in space, a race that, in an age of a bipolar world order, gripped
directly  and  indirectly  all  countries  of  the  globe.  This  space  race,  as  well  as  several
missions since then, has left a plethora of artefact material on the surfaces of the Moon,
Mars, Venus and, as of 2005, also on Titan, one of Saturn’s moons. While some of these
missions  have  landed  softly,  others  crashed  accidentally  or  on  purpose,  scattering
artefact material. Figure 1 shows a photograph of the nearside of the Moon with the
location of artefact scatters and landing sites. The landing site of Apollo XI in the Sea
of Tranquillity (no. 17) is the most significant of these, as it represents that location
where a human first stood on another celestial body. The question is, are we looking
after it adequately?

In the arena of space policy, a discussion has been underway to consider protecting
space  environments  from  human  impact,2  and  calls  have  been  made  to  protect  the
Apollo XI landing site as a World Heritage Site,3 and to prevent damage by space tour-
ists,4  but  also  to  consider  protecting  orbiting  space  craft.5  In  contrast,  the  heritage
community is only gradually turning its attention to the management of space heritage.
There are papers looking at the space heritage on Earth,6 namely national studies in the
USA7 and Australia,8 both considering the terrestrial and the maritime dimension.9

Part of the overall apathy by the heritage profession in dealing with this matter seems
to be that the Moon is deemed too far away, both physically and mentally—and so
much out of the reach of people—that it is not worth bothering about. The problem is
literally ‘out of this world’ and the chance of intentional or unintentional impact by
people, scientists or visitors is considered remote and futuristic. Furthermore, surely,
there are more pressing matters on Earth.

While without doubt many heritage sites of national and international significance
are under threat on Earth and additional sites are becoming threatened daily, it can be
argued that none of the sites on Earth are as unique as the Apollo XI landing site on the
lunar surface. There will only ever be one place where the first human set foot onto the
surface of another celestial body.

At this point, the reader is bound to be asking three questions: 

(1)

Is  this  argument  serious,  or  is  this  merely  an  academic  exercise  entertaining
otherwise idle ivory-tower dwellers?

(2) What is the likelihood that these sites will be threatened or destroyed?
(3)

If that does happen, so what? Why get worried about it?

Let us address these concerns in turn.

Fact or Fiction?

This argument is indeed serious. Space tourism is a reality and comprises both govern-
ment-initiated  tourism  (‘observers’)  and  commercial  ventures.  Christa  McAuliffe,  a
teacher who perished aboard the ill-fated Challenger mission of 1986, was one of the
first people recruited to fly into space as an observer. Former Mercury astronaut John
Glenn returned to the US space programme aged 77 to participate in a ‘study on the
effects  of  zero  gravity  in  older  people’.  These  ‘passengers’  were  chosen,  invited  and



359

trained by NASA to participate in missions primarily for the political consideration of
boosting the national ego and rekindling national enthusiasm in space exploration.

For  different  reasons,  fee-paying  passengers  have  since  flown  as  part  of  joint
Russian/US missions. Dennis Tito became the first paying space tourist in 2001, after
he paid $20 million to train in Russia for his flight. While NASA initially condemned
Russia for the move,10 the Russian space industry recognised this as a vital source of
income  in  the  post-Cold  War  era  and  developed  plans  to  expand  this  market.11  In
response,  soon  after  Tito’s  flight,  NASA  and  its  partners  in  the  International  Space
Station  agreed  to  rules  governing  who  could  fly  to  the  outpost  as  tourists.12  With
guidelines firmly set, several more potential space tourists began training in Russia13 in
an attempt to gain a seat on a mission.

The  costs  of  current  options  are  prohibitive  and  thus  prevent  larger  numbers  of
people from seeking the ultimate joyride. The technology and knowledge to return to
the  Moon  were  never  lost14  and  cases  for  renewed  developments  have  been  made
repeatedly,15 including the recent announcement that NASA will revisit the Moon by
2015.16  Plans  for  budget  space  flights  have  been  revealed  across  a  number  of  space
agencies  and  aerospace  corporations.17  Setting  aside  the  proposed  scientific18  and
commercial missions,19 one proposal desires to conduct tourist orbital flights around
the  Moon,20  while  another  will  send  a  probe  that  will  crash  into  the  lunar  surface,
taking  ‘cargo’  in  the  form  of  business  cards  and  ashes  as  a  permanent  memento.21
Recent  developments  have  seen  a  number  of  proposals  emerge  for  lunar  surface
tourism,22 including the development of accommodation,23 at greatly reduced cost.
This  could  open  a  floodgate  in  terms  of  space  flight  accessibility  for  a  significant
portion of the world’s population.

The Likelihood of its Happening

While it is possible, what is the likelihood of space tourism actually happening? Actu-
ally,  this  likelihood  is  greater  than  most  people  would  assume.  With  an  affinity  for
adventure and discovery, intrepid individuals blaze a trail that is followed at first by the
adventurous  and  then  by  the  broader  community.  Adventure  tourism  is  gaining
momentum, as thrill-seeking visitors are increasingly looking for the ultimate adven-
ture. Spectacular first feats are copied and over time become mass events. Consider that
the  world  was  astounded  when  Edmund  Hillary  and  Tenzing  Norgay  ascended  the
summit of Mount Everest in 1953. Today the area is crawling with climbers, with 264
ascents in 2003 alone.24

Anyone positing in 1960 that, within 30 years, paying tourists would be visiting the
Titanic, resting in the North Atlantic Ocean at a depth of some 3,780 m, would have
been subjected to ridicule and accusations of being a fantasist. Yet, the development of
remote-controlled  underwater  technology  as  well  as  the  development  of  micro-
submersibles capable of withstanding the pressures at such depths has seen repeated
visits to the Titanic25 as well as other deep-sea wrecks.26 The impacts soon followed.
The sudden accessibility of the wrecks resulted in an array of salvage claims with over
6,000 artefacts removed from the Titanic.27 Given this track record, it was therefore

360 D. H. R. Spennemann

only  a  matter  of  time,  and  money,  before  fee-paying  visitors  went  down  to  have  a
personal  look.28  To  date,  such  dives  are  mainly  add-ons  to  other  missions  to  the
Titanic, whether to obtain footage for films or to retrieve artefacts, but purely commer-
cial operations have also been advertised.29 More tourist activity is expected as deep-
sea diving technology is becoming more readily available and thus prices are set to fall.
If there are people prepared to climb into a small submersible and dive down almost
4,000m  to  look  at  a  shipwreck  only  partially  illuminated  by  the  submersible’s
floodlights, there can be no doubt that there are people prepared to fly to the Moon and
take a walk in Neil Armstrong’s footsteps.

So What?

As the reasons for the visits change and the number of visitors increases, so does the
level of impact. Even where the overall ethics of general tourists may be similar to those
of explorers and trailblazers, the sheer number of visitors in a mass-tourism situation
means that there will be damage caused by wear and tear on the environment. But also
there will be individuals among them who will not adhere to these ethics. For example,
there  will  always  be  individuals  who  collect  souvenirs  as  mementoes  of  their  visits,
ignoring any rules to the contrary and who will cause impact on archaeological heritage
sites.30 There are two issues we need to consider here—the impact of visitors taking
souvenirs for personal or scientific reasons and the presence of the visitors themselves.

The Artefact Assemblages

There is an abundance of material culture currently on the lunar surface, placed there
by the USA, the former USSR as well as, more recently, Japan. The preservation of this
material culture ranges from the very poor to the very good.

Many of the remote probes crashed onto the lunar surface because (i) of equipment
failure in the approach phase; (ii) their orbits decayed; or (iii) they were intentionally
crashed into the Moon to carry out seismic experiments. In most cases the crash would
have occurred with great velocity, thus in all likelihood smashing the probe/module/
rocket stage into small fragments and scattering debris over a wide area (in view of the
reduced gravity of the Moon—at about 1/6th that of the Earth).

The sites where spacecraft soft-landed are obviously in better condition. The greatest
concentration, the greatest localised distribution and the greatest range of artefacts is
associated with the six Apollo landing sites. These comprise the base of the lander and
objects nearby, and scientific equipment that had been placed on the lunar surface,
such as the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package or, in later missions, a lunar
rover.

There  is  already  a  precedent  for  the  retrieval  of  material  culture  from  the  lunar
surface, in this case for the purposes of studying the effects of long-term exposure of
materials  to  the  open  space  environment  in  general  and  the  lunar  environment  in
particular. The Surveyor 3 craft landed on the lunar surface in April 1967.31 Thirty-one
months later Apollo XII landed just 180 metres away from it (see Figure 2). Astronauts

Earth.32

Visitation

The visitation of heritage sites on the lunar surface, be it for scientific reasons or for
tourism, is also a significant issue for heritage management. The current best practice
of  minimising  tourist  impact  on  places,  in  the  ethos  of  ecotourism,  postulates  the
concepts of ‘tread lightly … take only photographs, and leave only footprints’.33 On the
lunar surface these very activities threaten the most significant cultural heritage site on
the Moon—the Apollo XI lunar landing site Tranquillity Base and the footprints of
Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin in the lunar dust (see Figure 3).

the artefacts left behind by the two astronauts, but also the totality of their movements
on that occasion as recorded by the tracks in the lunar dust. This is the ultimate heritage
site, of significance not only to humanity as a whole but also in terms of heritage pres-
ervation as a single site. No heritage site on Earth, of whatever significance, can boast
that all interaction on the site has been preserved—both because of subsequent inter-
action by other people and also because of the presence of an atmosphere on Earth with
the concomitant erosive forces of wind and water.

Any intrusive activity on the Tranquillity Base site will compromise its historic value.
The unique situation on the lunar surface is that, literally, one wrong step will reduce
the significance of the site. This places severe obligations on heritage managers.

A Question of Control

On  Earth  the  management  of  such  sites  can  be  effectively  carried  out  through  the
simple means of exclusion. There are many national parks systems where human visi-
tation is totally excluded—biosphere reserves immediately spring to mind,34 but also
the exclusion of visitors from some Indigenous sites in Australia. Such management,



363

however, requires that the managing authority has jurisdiction over the area. And this
jurisdiction flows from a claim of territoriality of the management agency’s country.
Here rests the crux when it comes to the management of sites on the lunar surface; the
Moon does not belong to any given country but to humanity as a whole. As a result, the
laws governing control are quite convoluted.

The  ownership  and  management  of  space  has  been  governed  by  International
Conventions, with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs being the lead
agency. The Moon Treaty of 197935 contains provisions for the preservation of heritage
on the Moon, yet there appears to be little preventing activities in the lunar environ-
ment. The treaty holds a principle of non-appropriation in relation to the Moon, and
advocates the notion of common heritage, similar in concept to Antarctica.36 It does
not preclude any nation from conducting activities on the lunar surface, provided it
does not make a claim of ownership.

Laws  governing  the  activities  of  states  and  territories  in  space  hold  that  the
country ‘on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain
jurisdiction  and  control  over  such  object’.37  Effectively,  any  non-owner  nation
removing  any  part  of  a  spacecraft  would  be  committing  an  act  of  theft  or  piracy.
This  extends  to  liability  for  damage  caused  by  space  objects  re-entering  the  Earth’s
atmosphere.38  National  heritage  legislation—US,  Russian  (as  legal  successor  to  the
former  USSR)  or  Japanese—governing  the  management  of  nationally  significant
moveable cultural heritage can be used to protect the artefacts on the lunar surface
per se from undue impact by citizens of their own countries—if the legislation allows
for  the  protection  of  such  heritage  outside  the  territorial  boundaries  of  that  state
(which most does not).

While removal of (parts of) a spacecraft and damage to such craft by non-nationals
are  covered  by  the  UN  conventions,  and  while  national  legislation  may  cover  the
actions of nationals, there is no convention that can prevent a party from going near a
spacecraft/artefact on the lunar or any other planetary surface (apart from Earth) while
not actually damaging it. In the absence of any territorial claims to the surface of the
Moon  on  which  the  landed  spacecraft  or  any  artefacts  are  resting,  the  traditional
concept of ‘trespass’ does not apply.

The Tragedy of the Commons and Self-regulation

In the absence of strong governmental control and surveillance, the management and
utilisation of communal lands and assets have posed serious problems in the past. The
best-documented example is the former town commons that existed under both Brit-
ish  and  German  law.  Lands  were  set  aside  for  communal  use  by  selected  persons
(‘commoners’) subject to the payment of a usage fee to the communal purse. As every
‘commoner’ owned the land, yet no one in particular, the system was open both to
abuse  and,  particularly,  mismanagement.  As  a  result,  the  productivity  and  environ-
mental quality of the land often declined.39 Individualism and personal greed were the
main contributors. In the end many of the commons were subdivided and sold off into
private hands—an asset lost to the community at large. The ‘tragedy of the commons’,

364 D. H. R. Spennemann
as the underlying principle was termed by Garrett Hardin,40 is a salutary tale for the
management of sites on the lunar surface.

With the collapse of institutionalised socialism and communism in the Soviet Union
and  its  partner  states,  there  is  no  longer  a  voice  that  counteracts  the  tendency  of
humans  to  prioritise  private  good  over  common  good.  While  the  ‘greed  is  good’
mentality of the 1980s has subsided, the currently dominant political paradigm still
favours the self-regulating power of a market economy driven by shareholder values
(‘capitalism’ in old-fashioned terms). At the same time, despite widespread rhetoric to
the contrary, there is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that industry self-
regulation does not work effectively, and that in every industry there appear to be cases
where business ethics are found deficient or blatantly absent.41 While this is regrettable
on Earth, it can be answered with rectifying, as well as punitive, actions. Any transgres-
sions of (self-)regulation on the lunar surface, say at Tranquillity Base, will irreversibly
damage the site in perpetuity for all humanity.

Personal versus Communal Rights

But  what  about  the  personal  right  to  property?  Unless  prohibited  under  respective
national law, the nation owning such items can dispose of them as it deems fit. In 1993
Russia sold at auction the rights to Lunokhod 1 in situ on the lunar surface. This space-
craft is now privately owned, and while retrieval of the craft seems unlikely at this stage,
it  is  not  unthinkable  that  future  technological  advancements  will  make  retrieval  a
viable reality.42 Should recovery become possible in the future, should the owner have
the right to retrieve it? And, if so, how are his rights to be balanced against the rights of
humanity to the preservation of the surrounds of the heritage item, i.e. what damage
could be done to other artefacts in the vicinity? Moreover, does the acquisition of the
spacecraft transfer a set of rights solely to the item itself, or does it also extend to the
right to damage all tracks and other evidence of activity that Lunokhod 1 had carried
out during its operational ‘life’? And how can this be managed?

On Earth, the closest approximation to the situation would be an archaeological site,
where individual artefacts are moveable cultural heritage items, but where they form
an integral part of a site and thus cannot be removed without damaging the site’s integ-
rity. Yet, the power to enforce this is derived from the authority to manage the land,
either as landowner, as in the case of government land, or through regulatory mecha-
nisms, as in the case of private land. The underlying assumption is that the site may be
on private land but that the artefactual material it contains is not owned by the owner
of the land. While most national heritage legislation holds such provisions, all material
culture outside the provisions of the act is not protected. There, the concepts of trea-
sure trove and abandoned property apply.43

The complicating factor in the management of property on the lunar surface is the
fact that the equipment is moveable cultural heritage. While there are conventions44 as
well as national laws that govern the movement of such items between countries, the
movement  of  the  items  within  a  country  is  normally  permissible.45  Again,  the
underlying principle for the management of the heritage items is that a government has



365

jurisdiction over heritage and that the specific item is located within the jurisdiction at
the  time  (or  covered  by  repatriation  agreements).  Given  the  absence  of  national  or
enforceable international jurisdiction, this does not apply on the lunar surface.

Managing the ‘Impossible’

So, how can humanity’s heritage on the lunar surface be protected and managed?

The management regimes that should be applied are easy to conceive: an exclusion
zone needs to be established that renders the site and its artefacts ‘off limits’—certainly
to tourism and ideally also to other investigations. Until technologies have been devel-
oped that allow hovering over the lunar surface without physically impacting on the
lunar surface in any way (such as through the downward thrust of expulsion engines),
we cannot contemplate even a heritage assessment at the sites without posing a threat
to the sites’ integrity. Clearly, rigorous protocols for assessing the heritage significance
of objects on the lunar surface need to be developed that prevent unintentional impact
in the course of heritage assessments, as well as any impact by future visitation.

Critics will argue that if we exclude all visitation and preserve the sites so that no one
can approach them for fear of damage, this will defeat the purpose of protecting them.
In the light of potential technological developments it is foreseeable that access without
disturbance will be possible one day. The site of Apollo XI is truly unique in the history
of humanity and must be managed with the long-term interests of humanity in mind.
The other five landing sites act as back-up sites should the Apollo XI site be destroyed
by direct meteor impact, for example. Thus it is prudent to manage these sites solely by
inclusion until such time as zero-impact technologies have been developed.

The protection regimes have to be cognisant that the Moon Treaty of 1979 has limi-
tations. The integrity of the artefactual material left on the Moon can be guaranteed
unless sold to private parties, but there are no provisions covering access to such items
and thus the integrity of the site itself. There is no terrestrial jurisdiction on the lunar
surface.  The  comparable  legal  situation  would  be  that  of  government-owned  ship-
wrecks and aircraft wrecks on the ocean floor located in international waters away from
the continental shelves. It would be difficult to actively manage a remote site of this
nature, unless strict controls are developed, otherwise it would come down to the ethics
of the individual visitor to maintain the historic integrity.

The solution will rest in a global heritage convention that must be ratified by all space
powers—and enforced through prohibitive penalties enacted through national legisla-
tion. For this, an example on Earth can be drawn on for comparison: Antarctica.

Managing the Heritage of Extraterritorial Territory

Antarctica was for a long time the realm of intrepid explorers only, such as Shackleton,
Amundsen,  Scott  and  Mawson.  By  the  1950s  several  nations  had  erected  bases  on
various parts of the continent, but all endeavour was largely scientific.

The 12 nations active in the Antarctic during the International Geophysical Year of
1957–1958  signed  the  Antarctic  Treaty  in  Washington  on  1  December  1959.46  The

366 D. H. R. Spennemann

primary purpose of the Antarctic Treaty is to ensure ‘in the interests of all mankind that
Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall
not become the scene or object of international discord’. To this end the treaty prohib-
its military activity, except in support of science; prohibits nuclear explosions and the
disposal of nuclear waste; promotes scientific research and the exchange of data; and
holds all territorial claims in abeyance. Subsequent protocols expanded the coverage of
the  Antarctic  Treaty,  such  as  the  Protocol  on  Environmental  Protection  (signed  in
Madrid  in  1991).  Legally,  the  treaty  is  binding  to  the  signatory  nations  only  (now
numbering 45), while it has moral force to non-signatory nations (through diplomatic
pressure in international fora such as the UN).

Once  considered  one  of  the  last  wilderness  areas  on  Earth,  Antarctica  is  being
thrown  open  to  ‘adventure  tourism’,  albeit  reluctantly.47  Commercial  tourism  to
Antarctica did not commence until December 1956 with a LANChile DC-6 conducting
an  overflight  tour.  In  1958  the  first  ship-based  tours,  out  of  Chile  and  Argentina,
commenced. By 1969 purpose-built cruise ships visited the waters and by the late 1980s
ship-based  tours  were  mounted  to  the  edge  of  the  pack-ice,  landing  visitors.48
Although strict rules govern tourism in this region, limiting the number of tourists
landed at any one time to safeguard the protection of the natural and historic values
from tourism impact, larger operators simply land groups in a continuous rotation. In
the Antarctic summer of 2000–2001 approximately 12,250 people were carried to the
Antarctic, rising to 24,281 people in 2003–2004.49 Even though no country can take
legal possession of all or portions of Antarctica, national constructs of sovereignty have
been developed that allow nations such as Australia to manage the resources in the
national interest, subject to International Conventions. This concept can be extended
to the lunar surface, where curtilages could be established around the landing sites and
the  heritage  contained  therein.  That  could  entail  provisions  that  limit  or  prohibit
resource-extraction activities (‘mining’) within a set radius around the site as well as
limit or prohibit any tourism operations.

The Need for Action—Now

While  to  the  uninitiated  it  would  appear  to  belong  to  the  realm  of  fantasy  and
impossibility, space tourism is a reality, and, although the industry is in its infancy, it
poses, as this paper has shown, a potential threat to heritage sites located across the
lunar surface.

Standard protected-area regimes are based on the premise that the administering
authority has territorial ownership over the land and thus legal authority to prescribe
land management regulations. As there is no territorial authority on the Moon, these
principles cannot function on the lunar surface.

It is vital that management strategies are put in place before lunar tourism and other
proposed scientific and commercial proposals become frequent and result in destruc-
tion of cultural heritage on the Moon. However, the harsh reality of any protective
measure is that active management is not at present a possibility. At best, the long-term
preservation of lunar heritage will lie with the exclusion of visitors.



367

Given the multilateral nature of the issue, and the lead times required to arrive at
international agreements, it is already time to start the management process. Humanity
can  ill  afford  to  lose  the  sites  that  are  associated  with  the  greatest  adventure  it  has
embarked on so far—to leave the confines of our own planet and set foot on another
celestial object.
