Alligators, crocodiles and cutlasses: trade mark
infringement in Guyana
Don Arp, Jr.*

The case of the Chinese cutlass
The global marketplace is preyed upon by unscrupulous
persons who, with access to cheaply made surrogate
goods, seek to trade on the good name and reputation of
companies by marketing inferior products under trade
names and marks that mirror higher quality brands.
Developed, ﬁrst-world nations are not the only front in
the war to protect trade marks and intellectual property.
The markets of the developing world present a rich
environment for infringement of trade marks and intel-
lectual property, offering perpetrators quick and sub-
stantial proﬁt with limited risk of interference from
local law enforcement. The author discovered such an
instance of trade mark infringement in the South Ameri-
can country of Guyana, involving the widely used local
style of machete called a cutlass. Although the design of
the cutlass itself is no longer protected, this case involved
importing lower quality goods produced in China and
marketing them under a brand which infringed the
trade mark of a long-established and well-respected tool
manufacturer based in the United Kingdom. This case
illustrates the need for ﬁeldwork in the developing world
to protect the trade mark and image of companies
whose goods are deployed in these distant markets.

What is a cutlass?
In many parts of the world where sugar cane is grown,
harvesting is still done by hand, using a large bladed im-
plement called variously a machete, matchet or cutlass,
depending on the locale in which the tool
is used.
Designs vary greatly by location. In Guyana, the cutlass
is a ubiquitous, multi-purpose tool for, inter alia, cutting
cane, chopping wood or perpetrating personal violence.
The cutlass is large, with a 22-inch blade that is narrow
near the wooden handle and steadily widens to a broad,
upswept point. Despite a passing familiarity to the panga-
style machete, the Guyanese cutlass is made to a design
which is unique to Guyana.

Due to the omnipresent nature of the cutlass and its
key role in Guyanese culture, there are numerous produ-
cers of cutlasses. By far the most prominent supplier of

cutlasses in Guyana is Ralph Martindale Ltd. Martindale
produces the highest quality cutlasses found in Guyana,
with various other ﬁrms attempting to compete; but with
implements of lesser quality, some of these competitors
try to confuse the buyer by playing off the Martindale
brand. Market share is critical to cutlass manufacturers as
the ubiquity of the cutlass and its heavy use and associated
wear provide the opportunity to trade in high yearly
volumes of implements.

Trade marks and brand loyalty
Visual branding in tools has a signiﬁcant history in South
America and the Caribbean. Each of the major ﬁrms
manufacturing cutlasses at various times in Guyana’s
history used images to represent itself. While this is quite
a commonplace practice in many industries, the signiﬁ-
cance of doing so with cutlasses and other agricultural
tools has its roots in the early 19th century. After the abo-
lition of slavery, many of the workers brought in from
India and China to cut sugar cane were illiterate, as were

even went so far as to mimic the model number used by
Martindale, 32L, depicted on the counterfeit as ‘321’.

from the lower-quality cutlass

the local Amerindians. By developing a visual trade mark,
such as a crocodile or a steamboat, cutlass producers gave
the workers something they could identify and ask for,
even if they could not read the manufacturer’s name. Once
a cane cutter became loyal to a brand, he usually would
not switch, even for lower priced goods.1 These trade mark
brands, through repeated selection, became the standard
and held most of the market.

Discovery
In June 2008, the author was in Guyana visiting friends.
As an anthropologist by training, he took a great interest
in local culture, especially the cutlass. The author visited
cane-cutter villages and hardware stores, purchasing
whatever examples of the cutlass could be found. In one
large retailer, the author discovered a cutlass with a large
label, denoting it as ‘Alligator Brand’, with the slogans
‘First Choice in Quality’ and ‘Made for the EEC’ appear-
ing above and below an image of an alligator and the ﬂag
of the United Kingdom (Figure 1). On the blade there
was also a faint etching or stamping of the same alligator
with the words ‘Alligator Brand’ and ‘M321’ and ‘22’
(Figure 2). Both of these labels imitated the labels used
by Ralph Martindale Ltd, a UK-based manufacturer well
known for its hand tools and crocodile brand logo
(Figures 3 and 4).

The imitation directly used the Martindale slogan,
‘First Choice in Quality’, in addition to including a depic-

Investigation
In his research conducted prior to the trip, the author
had made contact with a representative of Martindale.
The author sent images of the label to the representative,
who said that it was ‘clearly an infringement on our
trade mark—and we need to take action against the
importers/distributors’. Martindale also planned to get
the British High Commission in Guyana involved and
requested more information from the author regarding
location of the store and other relevant research.

In further research, the author found that a Chinese
manufacturing company produced the M321 cutlass and
marketed it under several brand names, none of which
was ‘Alligator’. This presented two options: (i) someone
purchased M321 cutlasses and rebranded them as Alliga-
tor or (ii) the Chinese manufacturer produced the
cutlasses under the Alligator brand in response to a cus-
tomer order. The author, after lengthy correspondence,
secured three examples of cutlasses produced by this
manufacturer, with one sample bearing a brand name
not claimed by the manufacturer. Given the lack of facil-
ities in Guyana for the etching or stamping, option (ii)
seems the most likely. One key difference is that the
Chinese manufacturer did not use adhesive labels of any
sort on its cutlasses, so that step may have taken place in
Guyana.

Mimicking the labels of better known products is
fairly common in Guyana. The author’s cutlass collection
includes an example of an Australian-style cane knife,
locally called a matchet, marketed under the brand name
‘Guyana Caiman’ with a motto of ‘Guysuco Classic’ and
all the while claiming to be a ‘U.K. brand’.

The Martindale representative noted having similar
counterfeit goods issues with the same store in 2005
and with another hardware store in 2007. Martindale
initiated its own investigation and involved the British
High Commission in Guyana. Martindale made contact
with the hardware store and received a communication
which implied that the store had purchased and sold the
counterfeit goods by mistake and suggested the cutlasses
came from Venezuela or Suriname. Counterfeit goods
ﬂow across all borders, and the borders between Vene-
zuela, Suriname, and Guyana are no different in this
respect. While it is possible that the counterfeit cutlasses

came from these sources, it is more likely that they
came into Guyana directly from China. A large quantity
of building materials and home ﬁxtures purchased in
Guyana is imported directly from China. While goods
from European countries are also present, these are often
prohibitively expensive to all but the most afﬂuent Guy-
anese. Further, Chinese business interests have become
deeply involved in several projects of varying scales in
Guyana, including the US$110 million Skeldon Sugar
Modernization Project. As this project is supervised
by Guyana Sugar Corporation, or GuySuCo, the direct
sourcing of the counterfeits to China seems likely and
could have been an initial attempt to enter the cutlass
market and compete for a GuySuCo supply contract.

Return visit
In 2009, the author made another trip to Guyana and
returned to the hardware store that was selling the coun-
terfeit cutlasses to investigate whether they had in fact
ceased selling the goods and had stocked genuine Mar-
tindale merchandise. The store had simply removed the
label from the cutlasses and was continuing to sell them
with the alligator etching described above intact. These
cutlasses were the only ones available in the store. Given
the fact that one year had passed between the author’s
visits, the store either had a signiﬁcant inventory of these
cutlasses to sell or the lower quality made buyers choose
to purchase from another store.

Fieldwork essential
Fieldwork and investigations are critical to protecting
trade marks and intellectual property. This is especially
true in developing nations, where law enforcement seldom
engages with cases of counterfeiting and trade mark in-
fringement. The opportunities afforded and the associated
chances of success for counterfeiters and others who
attempt to pass goods while infringing a trade mark are
enhanced in the developing world where people may have
a cultural heritage with a trade mark or speciﬁc tool
design. Investigation and re-investigation are necessary as
markets in developing nations are highly variable and op-
portunities to defraud buyers with lower quality merchan-
dise abound.
