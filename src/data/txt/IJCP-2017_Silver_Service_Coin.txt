 

A Silver Service and a Gold Coin
Justin St P. Walsh*

 

Abstract: The published history of a set of silver and gold objects acquired by 
the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1975 contains an unusual reference to a gold coin, 
supposedly found with the set but not purchased by the museum. The coin,  
which is both rare and well dated, ostensibly offers a date and location for the 
ancient deposition of the silver service. Almost five years of research into the 
stories of the Getty objects and the coin has revealed important information 
about these particular items, but it also offers a cautionary example for scholars 
who might hope to reconstruct the find-spot of antiquities that are likely to 
have been looted.

Keywords: Roman silver, Roman coin, J. Paul Getty Museum, illicit antiquities, 
unprovenanced antiquities

THE GETTY OBJECTS

Introduction

Description
In 1975, the J. Paul Getty Museum (Getty Museum) acquired a set of silver and 
gold objects (objects 75.AM.54–61; Figures 1–8).1 The objects consisted of a silver 
service of three cups (two of these, almost identical, had removable cup liners with 
handles; the third cup was in a different shape but had a similar Cupid motif), 
a jug with a satyr’s head on its handle, a ladle, and a jar/“psykter” (wine cooler), as 
well as a gold diadem and a gold ring (hereafter, this set of objects, including the 
jewelry, will be referred to collectively as “the silver service”) The museum does not 
know where or when the service was found, raising the possibility that they may be 
the product of illicit excavation and/or smuggling.2 The objects seem on a stylistic 
basis to be of Roman origin, perhaps dating to the late Republic or early Empire, 
with comparanda from as far apart as Italy, Thrace, Syria, Turkey, and Sudan.3 
Without reference to further information about these items, therefore, it is impos-
sible to be more precise about the objects’ origins, dates, or meanings.

From the time when the Getty Villa re-opened following its renovation in Janu-
ary 2006 up until the re-installation of the collection in 2017–18, these objects were 
on display in Room 105, which was dedicated to “luxury vessels.” The text accom-
panying this display of objects 75.AM.54–61 summarized the museum’s claims re-
garding the objects almost since their acquisition 42 years ago:

Vessels and Jewelry from a Burial: This group of vessels and jewelry is 
thought to come from a burial. It was found with a gold coin minted in 
Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) by the Roman general Mark Antony in 
34 bc. The coin helps date the objects to the middle of the first century 
bc. The silver set was for serving and drinking wine; all that is missing is 
a large bowl for mixing wine with water and a strainer for filtering out 
sediment. The pieces belonged to someone wealthy enough to be buried 
with an expensive collection of silver as well as costly jewelry.

The purpose of this article is to investigate the specific origin(s) of the Getty 
objects, with the aim of providing the greatest possible precision. It will particu-
larly consider the question of the objects’ relationship to the gold coin mentioned 

1In the earliest publications, the objects had an “AI” designation rather than “AM” (e.g., “75.AI.54”). 
By 1992, the “AM” designation was in use. Frel 1976; Oliver and Luckner 1977; Oliver 1980; Pfrommer 
1983.
2The literature concerning the looting of antiquities to fill the collections of wealthy private individ-
uals and public institutions is by now extensive. See, e.g., Gill and Chippindale 1993; Chippindale and 
Gill 2000; Mackenzie 2005; Watson and Todeschini 2006. For thorough discussions of the presence 
of looted material in the J. Paul Getty Museum specifically, see Burrough 1994; Brodie and Bowman 
Proulx 2014; Gill 2015; and, especially, Felch and Frammolino 2011.

in the museum’s display text. The coin was notably never acquired by the Getty 
Museum, either at the time it purchased the silver service or at some later date. 
Yet the claimed relationship between the Getty objects and the coin is apparently 
one of the few pieces of evidence that could help us to understand where the 
objects were originally found and (as the museum itself notes) to identify their 
date. If, indeed, they were found in Asia Minor and date to the end of the Roman 
Republic, they would be among the first pieces of silver solidly attributed to this 
region that could confirm the importance of such items in that time and place 
and their suitability as grave goods.

This study is by no means the first attempt to clarify the origin, collection history, 
and ancient significance of objects that appear to have been associated with looting. 
A landmark investigation of this kind was carried out in the 1990s by Malcolm Bell, 
III, who was able to build a convincing case that a different set of silver, acquired 
by the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1981 and 1984, had actually been 
illegally excavated around 1980 or 1981 from a Hellenistic house known today as  
the House of Eupolemos, in the ancient Sicilian city of Morgantina.4 This silver had 
likely been made in Syracuse, was carried to Morgantina, and eventually buried in a

author did not participate in any work on the Morgantina silver).

period of siege in 211 bc during the Second Punic War. In successfully reconstruct-
ing the history of the Morgantina silver, Bell was able to rely on contemporary 
second-hand rumors of the silver’s discovery, its artistic style, his deep knowledge 
of the site, the work of the American expedition to the site since 1955, the recovery 
of an ancient legal document naming a son of Eupolemos (thus matching an 
inscription on one of the silver pieces), and the support of the Italian government 
to excavate and identify the actual find-spot of the silver. Can such an investigation 
be  profitably  accomplished  for  the  Getty  objects  and  the  gold  coin?  Can  we, 
in fact, expect that these kinds of recontextualizations are likely, or even just 
possible, for the vast number of other artifacts in public and private collections 
whose excavation went unrecorded? This article will also explore the answer to 
that question.

Historical Context for the Getty Museum and the Acquisition
At the time of the museum’s acquisition of the objects under investigation here, 
the organization was still under the control of its founder, J. Paul Getty, although 
he had already been living permanently in the United Kingdom for two decades. 
Since 1973, the museum’s curator for antiquities had been Jiří Frel, a Czech art 
historian who had previously worked at the Princeton University Art Museum and 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Frel’s responsibilities included identifying and 
purchasing major pieces for the museum collection, but before Getty’s death in

June 1976, Frel had to have his choices confirmed by Getty.5 After this date, Frel 
was under the supervision of the museum’s Board of Trustees. He continued in his 
role as chief curator until 1986 (though he was placed on paid leave after 1984).6 
Frel’s departure from the museum was reportedly related to an investigation by the 
US Internal Revenue Service of donation practices, in which he was said to have 
supplied falsified and inflated valuations of objects that the trustees had refused

table deductions on their tax returns, and Frel would gain works he desired for the 
museum’s growing collection.

Introduction to the Public and Display of the Objects in the 1970s
The silver service’s first recorded display at the Getty Museum was on 1 June 
1976—just five days prior to J. Paul Getty’s passing—as part of an exhibition of 
recent  acquisitions.  The  exhibition  brochure,  written  by  Frel,  contained  at  least

one error as well as a story regarding the silver’s date that differed from the one 
later promulgated by the museum. Frel stated that “[t]hese 8 pieces were all found 
together in one grave, along with a coin of Mark Antony from 31 bc. … [The vessels] 
were made in Alexandria about 75 bc.”7 As noted above, the coin that was linked to

the silver actually dates to 34 bc. It is unclear whether the attribution of the vases to 
Alexandria or to a burial context were stories that Frel had received from the seller 
or his own deductions about their origin.

The connection to Alexandria and, indeed, to a single workshop for all of the 
vases, except the psykter, was restated in the fourth edition of the museum’s illus-
trated guide, written by Frel.8 Likewise, the link to the gold coin (again given a date 
of 31 bc) was noted. Particularly interesting is the fact that this text states that a 
“plastic cast” of the coin was put on display in the same case with silver service. It is

(see discussion below, “Further Information about the Coin”). The image accom-
panying this text illustrated object 75.AM.55, showing that its liner and handles 
were intact but that the tarnish on the cup’s surface had not yet been cleaned.

Silver for the Gods

In 1977 and 1978, the jug (75.AM.57) was part of the traveling exhibition Silver for 
the Gods: 800 Years of Greek and Roman Silver. This show took place at the Toledo 
Museum of Art, the Nelson Gallery (today the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas 
City), and the Kimbell Museum of Art in Fort Worth. The entry on the jug in the  
exhibition catalogue was written by Andrew Oliver, Jr.9 With regard to its origins,  
Oliver said only that the jug’s provenance was unknown but that it had been “acquired 
in Lebanon.”10 Oliver said that the jug had been purchased “with a ladle, two jars, 
and a pair of cups, all of silver, and a gold ring and diadem.” An explanation for the 
“second jar” may be that it is the same vessel as the third cup, though this is a strange 
nomenclature for what is clearly an open vessel. Alternatively, Oliver may not have 
seen the entire set at the time of his writing this catalogue entry and may have been 
relying on someone else’s (perhaps Frel’s?) flawed description.

Oliver’s Article
In 1980, Oliver published a full analysis of the Getty silver service that appeared in 
the museum’s own research journal. He called the service “a set of ancient silverware 

9Oliver and Luckner 1977, 114, cat. no. 74.
10In a perceptive conclusion to his review of this exhibition catalogue, of which Andrew Oliver was 
also co-editor, Malcolm A.R. Colledge (1979, 185) wrote that “[the book] is of exemplary standard; 
the reader’s only regret is that through the vagaries of human greed and the art trade the provenances 
of a tragically high proportion of these items have been lost, thus depriving the archaeological record 
of crucially important information.”

that ranks with the best of Greek and Roman silver ever to enter an American 
museum.”11 To date, this article offers the most complete description and analysis 
of the set. It also included important information about the previous history of the 
objects as it was known (or claimed to be known) by the museum. Oliver wrote:

A SILVER SERVICE AND A GOLD COIN 

263

Before coming to Malibu, the objects are known to have been in Beirut, 
and the museum possesses papers from the department of antiquities 
of Lebanon authorizing their export. Beyond that, however, nothing is 
known for certain about their origins except that the silver and jewelry 
must have come from a site—surely a tomb—inland from the northeast 
shores of the Mediterranean, and not from Egypt, Greece, or Italy.12

Oliver thus stated that the objects had been legally acquired, even though the 
location of their discovery was apparently unknown. No explanation for the lack 
of a find-spot was given. Neither was there any discussion of the objects’ collection 
history prior to their acquisition by the Getty Museum, including how long the 
objects had been in Lebanon prior to entering the collection. The name of the col-
lector, gallery, or dealer from whom the purchase was made was likewise not given 
in Oliver’s publication nor was the price or the location of the purchase stated.

Early in the article, Oliver gave an expanded version of the story that was later 
told in the museum’s wall text, saying: “An aureus of Mark Antony, struck in Asia 
Minor in 34 bc and alleged to have been found with the silver and jewelry, could  
not be acquired by the museum but is represented here by a plastic cast.”13 Neither 
the original coin nor the cast was shown in any of the images in the article. Accord-
ing to Oliver, the original coin could not be purchased by the museum because it  
had been sold at an auction in Munich in 1973—indicating, in other words, that 
if the coin had been available the museum would (or at least might) have tried to 
buy it together with the other objects.14 As a source for the 1973 sale, he cited 
a catalogue published by the numismatic auction house of Gitta Kastner.15 Since it 
was difficult to determine the date or the specific origins of the Getty objects from 
their style, the coin formed a critical component of Oliver’s interpretation of them. 
He characterized the aureus as the traditional payment for the ferryman to Charon, 
the land of the dead.16

Also for the first time, an argument concerning the origins of the silver was 
presented in a scholarly publication. The argument did not attribute the silver to 
Alexandria, as Frel had previously done. Instead, Oliver linked the assemblage of a 
silver service, gold adornments, and a gold coin to a few archaeologically excavated 
and published burials containing the same typological ensemble of grave goods 
found in and around modern Kayseri (ancient Caesarea) in Turkey.17 The first 
tomb, excavated in 1940 at Beştepeler, contained gold jewelry, silver vessels, and 
an aureus minted by Julius Caesar in 46 bc (unpublished, but reported by Oliver

when it was offered for sale (see discussion below, “Further Information about the Coin”).

to  have  been  on  display  in  the  Kayseri  Museum  in  1974).18  The  other  tomb, 
which  was  found  in  a  park  called  Gültepe,  adjacent  to  the  Kayseri  Museum, 
was  excavated  in  1971  in  advance  of  the  construction  of  a  hospital  building. 
The tomb was a built chamber within a tumulus called Garipler. It housed the 
remains  of  a  young  woman  buried  with  gold  and  silver  objects,  which  were 
published  by  the  local  museum  director,  Mehmet  Eskioğlu.19  An  aureus  of 
Augustus (given a date of ad 15 by the excavator) was found as well. In another 
publication, Eskioğlu also mentioned a second tumulus at Beştepeler that was 
subject to a rushed excavation in 1960 and was found to contain a gold coin.20 
Oliver noted that a jug in the Kayseri Museum (Inventory no. 2144, unpublished, 
no find-spot given by Oliver) has “a plain body and tall, narrow neck” similar 
to the “least refined” of the Getty silver vessels, the so-called psykter.21 Finally, 
Oliver stated that “fragmentary remains of bronze vessels were also said to have 
been once associated with the [Getty] group,” although he did not offer further 
information about these objects’ disposition, history, and location or a source 
for this information and claimed relationship, and it appears that the museum 
did not acquire them.22

Pfrommer’s Article
In a 1983 discussion of formal connections between Greek and Roman silver 
table vessels, Michael Pfrommer (then of the Deutsches Archäologisches Insti-
tut in Istanbul) mentioned one of the cups (object 75.AM.55) and the jug with 
the head of a satyr (object 75.AM.57), again in the museum’s journal. When 
introducing the cup, Pfrommer said it was “from Lebanon” and cited Oliver’s 
1980 publication.23 Initially, the jug was only said to be in the museum’s col-
lection  and  was  not  even  linked  to  the  cup  described  earlier.24  Slightly  later, 
however, Pfrommer remarked that “the findspot (Fundort) [of the jug] is Leb-
anon.”25  It  is  unclear,  however,  whether  these  statements  represented  a  new 
story promoted by the museum, a misunderstanding by Pfrommer of Oliver’s

A tumulus recently dug in Kayseri yielded an excellent grave group of Augustan date: glass vessels, 
some unusually fine, onyx vessels, silver ware, gold jewelry. Director Mehmet Eskioğlu will publish 
this tomb group which is the gratifying result of timely rescue digging.”

authorities in Kayseri were aware of the looting of tombs in that area, which might have been sources for 
the Getty service during the period in question (i.e., the late 1960s and early 1970s). Repeated attempts 
to locate and contact Mehmet Eskioğlu between 2013 and 2017 were unfortunately unsuccessful.

discussion of the objects’ provenance, or a disagreement by him with Oliver’s 
conclusions.

Künzl’s Article
In 1997, Susanna Künzl wrote an article for an exhibition catalogue on the form 
and function of Roman silver table services, including among her examples the 
Getty service (the Getty service was not a part of this show, which took place 
in  Cologne).  With  regard  to  the  set’s  origins,  she  stated  clearly  that  its  find-
spot was unknown, though she also repeated the claim that it was found with a 
coin.26 She was convinced on formal grounds that the silver formed a set and, 
in fact, that they had all been the product of the same workshop. Künzl noted 
particularly that the three cups not only had Cupid motifs but also that their 
feet  were  “identical.”  In  reality,  the  molding  on  the  stem  of  the  taller  cup  is 
somewhat smaller than those on the other cups, but perhaps this observation is 
overly precise in the context of ancient craftsmanship. In any event, one could 
point to the so-called “Solomon-Bocchoris” silver cup in the Boston Museum 
of Fine Arts (object 24.971), which also has an extremely similar foot but was 
excavated at Meroë in the Sudan, far from any suggested find-spot for the Getty 
service. In a related footnote, Künzl underlined the formal similarities of the 
jug, cups, and ladle in their “secondary details, such as the handle-attachments 
and feet,” which she saw as indicative of a single workshop.27 She did not mention 
the psykter (which is arguably quite different in style from the other vessels) or 
the set’s relationship to the jewelry.

The Ring
In  1992,  the  Getty  Museum  published  a  catalogue  of  its  collection  of  gems 
and finger-rings written by Jeffrey Spier.28 The ring that was part of the silver 
service appeared in this publication and was even featured on its front cover.29 
The ring features a cut stone decorated with a profile head from a famous classical 
sculpture, the Doryphoros (“spear-bearer”) by Polykleitos of Argos (active in 
the fifth century bc). According to Spier, this ring is the only known example 
showing this subject on a gem. He suggested comparisons with works by known 
Greek gem carvers of the first century bc, such as Gnaios and Solon, but he did 
not specifically attribute it to one of these artists. Regarding the ring’s origins, 
Spier repeated the mention of the coin first put forward by Oliver and accepted 
Oliver’s  conclusion,  saying:  “[It]  is  said  to  be  from  a  hoard  containing  late 
first-century silverware, a gold diadem, and a gold aureus of Marc Antony with

Summary of Public Descriptions of the Service’s Provenance and 
Acquisition

The lack of footnotes or other citations for the statements made by Oliver about the 
objects’ origins and their relationship to the coin appear to indicate that his source(s) 
for information came from within the museum itself, either from staff such as Frel or 
from the documentation that accompanied the objects.31 Oliver has recently stated in 
a personal communication to the author that he never examined any export docu-
ments, however, leaving Frel as his sole source for this information. Spier cited Oliver’s 
publication and a previous publication of the ring in the museum’s 1988 guide to the 
collections that repeated the same information. More recent guides to the collection 
(2002 and 2010) are no different. The fact that these publications’ appearance in venues 
owned and operated by the museum suggests that the assertions made within them 
about the objects purchased and owned by the museum are something more than 
scholarly—they are official institutional statements. The agreement of the display text 
describing the objects with Oliver’s and Spier’s writings confirms this interpretation.

More Recent Information about the Origin of the Getty Objects

New official information has appeared recently regarding the history of the Getty 
objects. In response to questions from the author about the objects in 2012, the Getty 
Museum stated that they had been acquired from Antike Kunst Palladion, a Basel, 
Switzerland, gallery owned by Gianfranco Becchina.32 Becchina is an Italian citizen 
who has been implicated in the smuggling and sale of looted antiquities, especially 
from the south of Italy and Sicily. His name appeared in the famous “organigram” 
recovered by Italian police in 1994 that listed participants in the illicit antiquities 
trade and their relationships to each other. Antike Kunst Palladion and Becchina’s 
storerooms were raided by police on several occasions beginning in 2002, leading 
to the seizure of thousands of objects as well as his archives. He was tried and con-
victed by an Italian court in 2011.33 Becchina sold objects from other parts of the 

30In addition to citing Oliver’s article, Jeffrey Spier also made reference to the coin’s publication in 
the catalogue for the Wealth of the Ancient World exhibition (Von Bothmer 1983), even though the 
coin’s entry in that book did not mention the Getty service (see discussion below, “Sale History”).
31J. Paul Getty, who could be considered another possible source for the information, had already died 
when Oliver began his work on the objects.
32The information about the seller now appears in the Getty Museum’s online catalogue for the 
objects, under “Provenance,” https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/7228/unknown-maker-

ancient world besides Italy, including the eastern Mediterranean and Near East. 
The  Getty  Museum  alone  counts  at  least  110  objects  of  Near  Eastern  origin 
purchased from Antike Kunst Palladion in its online catalogue, including a set 
of 33 Parthian silver and gold vessels and jewelry dating to the second century ad, 
which were acquired in 1981.34

Oliver stated in a personal communication to the author in 2013 that he believed 
that Frel had seen the coin with the service and jewelry at Antike Kunst Palladion. 
Unfortunately, Becchina’s archive has not been published, but two scholars in 
possession of copies of it have confirmed that three of the objects purchased by 
the Getty Museum—one cup, the jug with a satyr on its handle, and the ladle—
appeared in four photographs (Figures 9–12).35 Additionally, a stamp apparently 
made from the stone in the ring also appeared in its own photograph (Figure 13). 
These pictures appeared consecutively in the archive. This fact could indicate that 
they formed a set, but it could just as easily indicate that Becchina was simply 
marketing them as a set—or it may not have any significance at all. In the images,  
the pieces have not yet been restored. The jug (the only piece from the service for 
which two pictures appeared in the archives) showed a piece of adhesive tape across 
its belly, perhaps indicating a hole (Figure 10). The jug and cup both showed signs 
of tarnish. Two decorative flanges that extend outwards from the bowl and handle of 
the ladle in the Becchina photograph were at some later period bent back to attach to 
the bowl rim. The cup (object 75.AM.54, with the image showing what the museum 
refers to as “Side B”) is missing its handles, indicating that its liner was not inserted 
at the time the photograph was made.36 None of the other pieces from the service 
acquired by the Getty Museum appear in the Becchina archive. The coin likewise 
does not appear anywhere in the documentation seized by the Italian police.

THE GOLD COIN

It is time now to consider what other information exists about the gold coin that 
the museum claimed is associated with its objects. It is certain from the references 
in the Getty Museum’s publications and other sources that the coin exists. It is less 
certain that the coin actually is related to the silver service, but, if it is, it may be 
of great significance for unraveling the story of the Getty objects prior to their 
purchase by the museum.

34A list of the Near Eastern objects sold by Gianfranco Becchina to the Getty Museum can be found 
in the museum’s online database. J. Paul Getty Museum, “Museum Collection Search,” http://bit.
ly/2uN2WFo (accessed 22 August 2017).
35I extend my sincere thanks to Daniela Rizzo and Christos Tsirogiannis for their consultations 
regarding the Becchina archive.
 36With regard to the cup handles, Oliver (1980, 158) noted: “The decorated casings slip easily on and 
off their inner liners, and since the handles are attached only to the rims of the liners, the positioning 
of the handles with respect to the reliefs is arbitrary and adjustable.” The repairs to the ladle and jug 
were not mentioned.

Sale History

As with the Getty objects, the history of the coin is complex, involving a published 
set of documents and claims by various people involved in the story. This article 
will therefore first explain what was claimed by the museum to have happened 
as well as what was recorded in print when the coin appeared in various publi-
cations. It will then discuss what other information has since emerged as part of 
this investigation regarding the coin’s journey from one collection to another.  
As previously noted, Oliver stated in 1980 that the coin was not available for 
purchase by the Getty Museum in 1975 with the silver service because it had been 
previously sold at an auction. The coin was indeed offered for sale at an auction 
held by Gitta Kastner in Munich in November 1973, where it comprised Lot 
212.39 This seems to have been the first appearance of the coin in public view. 
The  catalogue  entry  for  the aureus,  written  by  the  numismatic  scholar  Peter 
Robert Franke, noted its extreme rarity as well as its mint condition, with only 
a small scratch on the reverse side. No information was offered regarding the 
coin’s origins or its collection history, nor did Franke connect the coin to a set

of silver and gold objects.40 The anticipated price was 200,000 Deutsche marks 
(roughly US $75,500 at the going exchange rate, which was approximately equal to 
the individual values of several of the objects in the silver service).41

Following the auction, the coin did not appear again in public until 1983, when 
it was shown as part of a collection assembled by Nelson Bunker Hunt and William 
Herbert Hunt, two brothers who were the scions of a Texas oil fortune. The exhibi-
tion, entitled Wealth of the Ancient World, displayed the objects acquired by the 
Hunts over a period of no more than five years of collecting.42 The catalogue 
entry  for  the  aureus  makes  no  mention  of  its  collection  history  or  find-spot.  
No relationship was claimed to the objects, which had, by now, been in the Getty 
Museum’s collection for almost eight years. This fact appears all the more unusual 
because Oliver’s article describing the purported relationship had appeared in 

40In a letter in July 2013, Franke said the Getty Museum’s story connecting the coin and silver service 
was “unbekannt und völlig neu” (“unknown and completely new”) to him.
41The catalogue’s list of estimated prices actually states: “Der Katalog enthält Münzen, die—ihrer 
Einmaligkeit und Unvergleichlichkeit halber—nicht geschätzt werden können. Die Bewertungsliste 
kennzeichnet diese Stücke durch * und setzt jene Bewertungen ein, die von den Einlieferern genannt 
sind” (“The catalogue includes coins which—due to their uniqueness and lack of comparanda—
cannot be given estimates. The list denotes these lots with a * (sic) and uses the reviews offered by 
their consignors”). Kastner 1973, “Schätzungen—Prix d’Estimation—Approximative Valuations” 
(translation by the author). Lot 212—the Antony and Antyllus aureus—is one of these lots, given 
a valuation of “*200,000,--.” The aureus is absent from the subsequently published list of sold lots.

a major scholarly publication disseminated by the museum three years earlier,  
and Arthur Houghton, then assistant curator of antiquities at the Getty Museum, 
had written the introduction to the section of the catalogue regarding the Hunts’ 
coin collection.43

The Hunt brothers were forced to sell their collection when they were declared 
bankrupt by a court following an ill-fated attempt to corner the global market in 
silver. The collection, including the aureus, was sold at Sotheby’s in New York in 
June 1990 (the original estimate for the aureus was US $50,000–70,000; it was sold 
for US $104,500).44 Once again, no mention was made in the catalogue of the coin’s 
origins or of a connection to the Getty objects. It was sold again a year later at Bank 
Leu in Switzerland (“[f]rom a distinguished American collection”; the original 
estimate was 120,000 Swiss francs, and it sold for 140,000 Swiss francs).45 The most 
recent public sale of the coin seems to have been in March 2010 at Numismatica  
Ars Classica in Zürich, where a telephone bidder purchased it for 450,000 Swiss 
francs (with an original estimate of 250,000 Swiss francs).46 The coin’s current 
whereabouts are unknown.

Once again, in none of these more recent sales was any statement made about 
the original find-spot of the coin or the possibility that it might be connected to a 
set of well-published objects in the collection of a prominent museum.47 It is not 
clear why coin collectors have apparently remained ignorant of the Getty’s claims 
about the coin. In discussions with well-informed coin dealers during the research 
for this article, none claimed previous knowledge of the Getty’s story, and several 
expressed surprise at it. Catharine Lorber, the author of the catalogue entries for the 
coins in the 1983 Hunt collection show, said:

I have to express some skepticism about the alleged provenance of the 
aureus. It strikes me as odd that this fascinating information was not 
divulged either to Peter Robert Franke or to me, when it would have 
added to the allure of a very rare and valuable coin. Coin dealers always 
want lengthy text to accompany especially important coins, even if there 
is nothing interesting to say. It’s therefore hard to believe that they would 
have suppressed this particularly interesting information, which beyond 
enhancing the coin might have facilitated the sale of the treasure.48

43In a personal communication in 2014, Arthur Houghton stated that he had been unaware of the 
claimed connection between the Getty’s objects and the coin and that he now does not believe that 
they are related. He further stated that he believed that the story was a fiction concocted by Frel to 
support his efforts to convince J. Paul Getty or the board to acquire the coin because he desired it for 
the collection, not because it actually was linked to the silver service. See note 60 below.

Jeffrey Spier, who mentioned the coin in his publication of the Getty ring, 
is known to have been active in the numismatic trade.49 But Spier’s knowledge of 
the claimed relationship between the coin and the service also did not become 
widespread. Indeed, on the basis of Lorber’s statement, it even seems unlikely 
that dealers and collectors know, but disbelieve, the story promoted by the Getty 
Museum since the existence of the claim (however untrustworthy) would aug-
ment the notoriety and worth of the coin and, thus, would likely have appeared 
in sales catalogues or other publications.50

Further Information about the Coin

As it turns out, even the coin’s initial appearance on the market is shrouded in  
secrecy. The Getty Museum and several scholars have claimed that it was not 
acquired by the museum because it was sold at the 1973 Kastner auction. In reality, 
as confirmed both by Kastner’s subsequent publication of achieved prices and by 
a personal communication from Peter Robert Franke in 2013, the coin certainly 
did not find a buyer at this auction. Franke noted that the official consignor of the 
coins for the Greek and Roman part of the auction was another Munich dealer, 
Egon Beckenbauer. However, Franke stated in a letter that there were rumors that 
the coins (especially “the best pieces,” though, as he put it, “which ones?”) were  
actually  consigned  by  one  or  more  Turkish  sellers.51  Although  he  could  not 

49Spier was one of the primary participants in the OKS Partners group that purchased the so-called 
“Decadrachm Hoard” in 1984. This hoard was later shown to have been discovered in illicit excava-
tions at Elmalı, Turkey. It was claimed by, and later restituted to, Turkey. N. Brodie, “The Investment 
Potential of Antiquities,” Stanford University, August 2009, https://web.stanford.edu/group/chr/cgi-
bin/drupal/files/investments.pdf (accessed 22 August 2017).
50It would be an unfortunate irony, though not an unexpected one, if publication of this article 
leads to significantly higher prices for the aureus at future sales because it draws greater attention 
to the Getty Museum’s claimed history for the coin.
51One method of determining which coins were considered “the best pieces” in the auction is to exam-
ine the estimated price list. Seven of the 358 coins offered for sale (lots 52, 89, 146, 212, 251, 301, 
and 302) were attributed estimated prices of 90,000 Deutsch marks or higher in the Kastner catalogue, 
and all were marked with the * described in note 33 above (the next closest estimated price was 27,000 
Deutsch marks for lot 263). All of the seven high-estimate lots were minted in or around the territory of 
modern Turkey, except lot 251 (but lot 251’s depiction of Armenia could link it to that region). None 
had find-spots, nor had they been published or offered for sale publicly prior to this auction (Peter 
Robert Franke co-authored an article on lot 89 in Chiron in 1974 [Franke and Schmitt 1974]).

vouch for the authenticity of these rumors, contemporary discussion apparently 
centered on a gentleman called by the name “Mister Fuad” or something similar.

A well-known antiquities dealer in Munich in the second half of the twentieth 
century was a Turkish citizen named Fuat Üzülmez, owner of Artemis Galerie. 
Other  dealers  who  worked  with  Üzülmez,  such  as  Bruce  McNall  (co-owner 
of Summa Galleries; see discussion below, “Bruce McNall”), were used to calling 
him only by his first name.  According  to  the  journalist  Suzan  Mazur,  Robert 
Hecht’s daughter called him “Uncle Fuat.”52 In articles in Connoisseur magazine 
in 1988 and 1990, Üzülmez was linked by Turkish journalists to organized crime 
and the illicit trade in antiquities from that country, and he was the subject of 
investigations  by  police  for  those  alleged  activities.53  In  April  1975,  German 
police  discovered  a  suitcase  full  of  coins,  gold  jewelry,  and  a  terracotta  vase 
belonging to Üzülmez at the Frankfurt airport; it was seized and turned over to 
the Turkish consulate.54 It seems at least possible—perhaps even likely—that 
Üzülmez and the “Mister Fuad” remembered by Franke are the same person.

An unexpected, but relevant, development occurred when the author made a 
request to the Getty Museum in 2013 for information regarding the “plastic cast” 
of the coin reported by Oliver to be held by the museum. The museum responded 
that the cast could not be located.55 The Lebanese export document described by

None of these lots sold, according to the list of achieved prices. The highest price achieved in the auction 
was 25,500 Deutsch marks (lot 343, a Byzantine coin). The high-estimate coins from the Kastner sale are 
indeed spectacular with regard to their rarity and quality, if not their archaeological contextualization: lot 
52 is a unique example (and it served as the cover image for the sale catalogue); lot 89 is the finest of five 
examples of what is widely recognized as the earliest known coin issue (Franke and Schmitt 1974: “of out-
standing historical, culture-historical, and numismatic significance”; the coin was purchased in 1974 by 
the Deutsche Bundesbank; the bank stated in a personal communication in 2017 that it had no knowledge 
about the seller’s identity); lot 146 is one of just two known examples of the issue, and the Kastner one is 
much better preserved than the other; lot 251 was described (Franke and Schmitt 1974) as “a masterpiece 
of Roman imperial courtly art”; and lots 301 and 302, which share the same reverse die, are each described 
as both “freshly minted” and “unique.” It cannot be proven on current evidence that these coins formed a 
single consignment group, but their common features equally cannot be discounted.

A SILVER SERVICE AND A GOLD COIN

Oliver also could not be found. An investigation of the relevant files by curatorial 
staff, however, did reveal that the museum had received a letter, dated 1 December 
1975, from a certain Pierre Nonnweiler of Brussels who offered to sell the aureus.56 
The Nonnweiler letter stated that it was a response to a letter by Frel of 10 November  
1975.57 It is worth noting that the Getty possesses a letter from Antike Kunst 
Palladion dated 1 September 1975, stating that it had sent the silver service from 
Switzerland to Malibu.58 This transaction, therefore, must have been completed 
slightly earlier, presumably in August. In making reference in his letter to photo-
copies of the Kastner catalogue previously provided to Frel, Nonnweiler stated 
that he possessed the coin and was willing to sell it for 300,000 Deutsch marks 
(roughly US $120,000 at the historical rate).59 The denomination of the sale price 
in marks rather than Belgian francs might well indicate that the coin (or its true 
owner) was still located in Germany.

From Nonnweiler’s letter, it appears that Frel was trying to acquire the aureus 
in November 1975.60 Yet the museum clearly did not purchase the coin from 
Nonnweiler following his offer. One possibility why the coin was not bought is that 
J. Paul Getty was not interested in collecting them; there has even been a suggestion 

56Pierre Nonnweiler died sometime in the late 1970s; he was reportedly close to antiquities dealers in 
Istanbul, and, in 1969, he donated a collection of coins mostly minted in cities in Turkey to the Royal 
Belgian Library. François de Callataÿ, personal communication, 2014. He also donated four Phrygian 
terracotta figurines to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem (IMJ) in 1971. Later, another 20 objects, 
all previously in Nonnweiler’s collection and “originating in ancient Anatolia” also arrived in the 
museum, donated by other collectors who purchased them as a gift for the museum (as stated by 
Laura Peri, current IMJ curator of western Asiatic antiquities, personal communication, 2014). 
None of these objects has a known find-spot. In short, it appears that Nonnweiler frequently col-
lected objects created (and likely found) in the territory of modern Turkey, and the conditions 
of their surfacing may be considered suspicious.
 57The Getty Museum states that it does not have a copy of Frel’s letter to Nonnweiler. Jeffrey Spier, 
personal communication, 2016.
 58See discussion below, “Export Permits”.
59The text of Nonnweiler’s letter is as follows: “Rentrant de voyage, je réponds à votre letter du  
10 novembre en vous envoyant le catalogue complet dont je vous avais déjà envoyé photocopies de 
la page 44 et de la liste des prix d’estimation, la photo que vous avez déjà reçue provident de la table 2 
de ce catalogue. Je vous confirme que je suis en possession de la monnaie et que je suis disposé à vous la 
céder pour 300.000 D.M.” (“Returning from traveling, I am responding to your letter of 10 November, 
sending you the complete catalogue from which I earlier sent you photocopies of page 44 and the 
list of estimated prices, the photo which you have already received comes from Plate 2 of that 
catalogue. I confirm that I am in possession of the coin and that I am disposed to let you have it for  
[Deutsch marks] 300,000” [author’s translation]). Kastner’s catalogue (1973, 44) indeed describes 
the Antony and Antyllus aureus, and Plate 2 illustrates it.
 60In  the  unattributed  introduction  to  a  coin  auction  catalogue  published  in  2012  by  the  Classical 
Numismatic Group and Nomos dealers, Frel was described as having “had a plan—never realized— 
to build a collection of coins of the highest caliber. He used to say that it was no longer possible to 
assemble a first rate collection of sculpture or vases—regardless of financial resources—because 
the finest pieces were already in museums but that it was still possible to buy the finest quality coins.”

that he did not like them because of their ancient association with death.61 In a 
personal communication in 2017, Spier revealed that Frel had written a description 
of the museum’s collection in the 1980s, though it was never finished. In his discus-
sion of the silver service, Frel wrote:

[J.  Paul  Getty,  who]  had  only  moderate  sympathy  for  English  or  even 
French silver, was similarly luke-warm about ancient silver … A modest 
but good set of six pieces (jug, ladle, three cups, strainer) appeared on 
the market. Getty liked the photographs and still more one cup shown 
to him on approval and had transmitted to the dealer the recommenda-
tion to purchase the whole set. The set cost far more money than Getty 
intended to spend. Negotiations were protracted for one year and then 
for another … Getty liked it very much, enjoying the fact that it was a 
complete set, but he refused categorically to spend any money for the 
aureus which went with the set. This was not to save money, but because 
the set came from a grave and the coin was in the dead man’s mouth to 
pay the ferryman, an idea that did not appeal to Getty.62

There is substantial pertinent information in this passage, though Frel’s docu-
mented activities (such as those that led to his forced retirement) require it to be 
treated with caution. For example, he stated that the (unnamed) dealer showed six 
items, not eight. The ring and diadem were not mentioned anywhere in the text 
nor was one of the two jugs. At the same time, a strainer—perhaps confused with 
the ladle (though it has no holes)—was stated to be present.63 The extent of the 
negotiations seems to push Getty’s first awareness of the setback to 1974 or pos-
sibly even 1973. Frel clearly claimed that the aureus “went with the set,” which was 
“complete.” This completeness may have meant that Frel understood that all of the 
silver vessels in the original tomb were for sale together, not that all items found 
in the tomb were present, if we recall Oliver’s reference in 1980 to unacquired 
“fragmentary bronze vessels.”64 The mention of the coin being “in the dead man’s 
mouth” may simply have been a broad generalization of ancient practice, but if it 
actually transmits the story of the burial that went with the silver service and/or 
with Marc Antony’s aureus, it is worth noting by contrast that Eskioğlu had identi-
fied the deceased person in the Garipler tumulus at Kayseri as a young woman, and 
the associated gold coin was found not in the mouth but, rather, “nearby.”65

61Felch and Frammolino (2011, 26) reported that Getty’s discomfort with death was such that Frel 
once presented a sculpted tombstone that was available for purchase as simply an “archaic relief.” 
Bruce McNall also commented on Getty’s disinterest in coins for this reason. Bruce McNall, personal 
communication, 2017.

placing a coin with the dead in the Roman period, see Alföldy-Gazdac and Gazdac 1995.

A SILVER SERVICE AND A GOLD COIN 

279

With regard to the coin, Frel’s text seems to indicate that Getty refused to pur-
chase it when he bought the service; again, likely around August 1975. But this 
cannot account for the coin’s subsequent availability from a different source 
in November and December (perhaps even as early as October, given the date of 
Frel’s letter, as cited by Nonnweiler). It is hard to imagine Getty would reconsider a 
decision he had made only a few months earlier, and Nonnweiler’s letter makes no 
claim or acknowledgment of a relationship between the coin and the silver. Did Frel 
bring it to Getty’s attention as being associated with the set only when Nonnweiler 
offered it? Was he trying to acquire the coin only because he wanted a major numis-
matic collection at the museum?66 If so, why did he continue to promote the story of 
a connection between the silver service and the coin after Getty failed to buy it, and 
why did he not acquire it following Getty’s death in 1976?

Bruce McNall
After Nonnweiler’s failed offer of the aureus to the Getty Museum, the coin found 
its way into the Hunt collection. Almost all of the works collected by the Hunt 
brothers, including the aureus, were bought from Summa Galleries, a Beverly Hills 
business owned by Bruce McNall and Robert Hecht.67 McNall had begun as a coin 
dealer, then later partnered with Hecht, who acquired art in Europe and sent it to 
California for McNall to sell.68 McNall has stated that he sold the aureus “for at 
least $100,000” to the Hunts sometime around or after 1981 and, moreover, that 
he had received the coin from Üzülmez (from whom he had received many other 
objects).69 The possibility thus emerges that Nonnweiler’s 1975 letter was part of 
an effort by him, together with Üzülmez, and perhaps also Becchina, to maneuver 
looted antiquities into public collections via multiple avenues, so that the objects’ 
illicit origins would be disguised. This possibility seems all the more likely since a 
long relationship has been documented between Becchina and Nonnweiler.70 The 
Italian prosecutor Paolo Ferri referred to this strategy as “triangulation” in the cases 
of dealers like Becchina and Giacomo Medici.71

Hunt  collection  by  1983  when  it  went  on  display  in  the  Wealth  of  the  Ancient  World  exhibition. 
Summa Galleries was the publisher of the exhibition catalogue, and Catharine Lorber, noted above as 
the author of the coin entries, was married to McNall at the time.

 71For triangulation, see Watson and Todeschini 2006, 77–78. Tsirogiannis (2016) has recently docu-
mented evidence for links between Giacomo Medici and Üzülmez. A Roman-period marble statue of 
Vibia Sabina, formerly in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, was restituted to Italy based on the fact that 
it was pictured in Medici’s archive. This item may in fact have passed from Turkey, not Italy, through 
Üzülmez’s hands. Medici, according to another dealer, Nikola Koutoulakis, visited Üzülmez’s warehouse 
to see the statue on 15 July 1974 and used his Polaroid camera to document the visit. Robert Hecht 
bought the statue from Üzülmez, however, and then sold it to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

McNall stated that he did not know Pierre Nonnweiler (and there is no evidence 
to show that he did). McNall further stated that he was unaware of the Getty Muse-
um’s claim of a link between its objects and the coin. This point is surprising since 
a close relationship has been documented between McNall and Frel in the period 
following J. Paul Getty’s death. McNall and Hecht sold many objects to the Getty 
(at least 70 are still in the collection, according to a search of the museum’s online 
catalogue). According to the reporting of journalists Jason Felch and Ralph Fram-
molino,  Frel  also  worked  with  McNall  on  his  previously  mentioned  scheme  to 
have wealthy Angelenos (including well-known celebrities) purchase objects from 
Summa Galleries and donate them to the museum.72 In many cases, it seems the 
donors never even received the objects from Summa; instead, they went directly 
from the gallery to the museum. In this way, Frel was able to collect objects that he 
found desirable but that he could not convince the new Board of Trustees to pur-
chase. These artworks frequently had illicit, or at least mysterious, origins. Frel also 
allowed McNall to place objects available for purchase from Summa on display in 
the galleries of the Getty Villa, where he would bring prospective buyers for visits. 
The close contacts between McNall and Frel again raise the question: if McNall had 
the coin in the late 1970s or the early 1980s, and if the story linking the coin to the 
silver service was true, why was Frel unable (or suddenly unwilling) to acquire it?

2017 RESPONSE FROM THE GETTY MUSEUM

Export Permits

The Getty Museum’s 2017 response to the author’s queries also revealed the exis-
tence of the Lebanese export permits first mentioned by Oliver.73 The museum said 
that the papers were found separated from the documentation for the silver service 
in a file belonging to an unrelated object. The documents, originally in Arabic but 
with signed and stamped official translations in French, were provided to the 
museum by Antike Kunst Palladion in a letter dated 1 September 1975.74 The letter 

72Felch and Frammolino 2011, 32–37.
 73Prior to 1988, Lebanese export documents were governed by Law no. 166 of 1933, especially Art. 44 
(see Seif 2015, 66–67).
74Unfortunately, the author does not read Arabic and was not allowed to make copies of the original 
documents to show to a translator. He therefore relied on the attached official French translations for 
the following account. The letter from Antike Kunst Palladion, in English, was addressed to J. Paul 
Getty’s personal aide at the time, Norris Bramlett. It claimed to present documents showing the export 
of the objects from Lebanon, the import of the objects to Switzerland, and the export of the objects 
from Switzerland. Only the documents associated with the export from Lebanon are present in the 
museum’s files today. A note associated with the photographs in the file from a woman named Janet 
to Frel states: “Norris feels that you might like to keep these photographs in your files—we have all 
the documentation here.” This note seems to show that the full documentation was originally kept by 
Bramlett on behalf of J. Paul Getty. The loss of any other documents associated with the silver service 
may be associated with the maintenance of Getty’s archives or their eventual transfer to the museum.

was signed “R.J. Becchina” (probably indicating Ursula Juraschek, Gianfranco 
Becchina’s wife, who went by the name “Rosie”).75 The permits are the only ones 
from Lebanon known to be in the museum’s possession.76

At this point, it may not be surprising to the reader that these documents raise 
more questions than they answer.77 Rather than a single permit that concerns only 
the objects acquired by the Getty Museum, plus the coin, there were two separate 
permits plus associated documents, with vague descriptions that seem to include 
some of the objects in the silver service while omitting at least one of them. They 
also include several other objects that were not bought by the museum and that 
may or may not have been associated with the service when it was discovered. No 
mention is made in any of the documents of a find-spot for any of the listed objects. 
The permits were signed by “Dr Hareth al-Boustani” and bear stamps from the 
Directorate-General (Dr Hareth Boustany was the director of the Beirut Museum, 
and the permits bear notes stapled to them, in English, reading: “Please observe the 

75“Record €50m Hoard of Looted Italian Antiquities.”
 76Jeffrey Spier, personal communication, 2017.
77It is worth noting that the very authenticity of the permits must be treated with caution, given their 
date and their claimed origin in Lebanon. Several other well-known pieces of classical art, including 
the Roman silver set known as the Sevso Treasure, which were acquired by collectors and museums 
around this time were also said to have come from or through Lebanon. The Sevso Treasure was 
specifically said to be accompanied by legal export documentation from Lebanon. G. Norman and 
T. Hoving, “Inside the silver syndicate,” Independent on Sunday, 29 December 1999, 2–5, at 4. The Getty 
Museum considered purchasing the Sevso Treasure in 1984 but decided not to do so after then 
assistant curator Arthur Houghton learned that the documents had forged signatures. True 2000, 
140; Kurzweil, Gagion, and de Walden 2005, 84. The most famous example of a false collection his-
tory  involving  Lebanon  in  the  1970s  is  probably  the  Euphronios  krater  showing  the  death  of  the 
hero Sarpedon, purchased in Switzerland in 1972 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art from Hecht 
(formerly object 1972.11.10; today in the Museo nazionale cerite at Cerveteri, Italy, having been 
returned to that country by the Metropolitan in 2006). According to news reports at the time, and 
later described by the then director of the museum, Thomas Hoving, in his memoirs, Hecht reportedly 
told the museum at the time of the sale that he had acquired the krater from a man living in Beirut, 
who had inherited it from his father. Hoving 1994, 307–40. Hecht’s story was later found to be false, 
and the vase now seems likely to have been looted from a tomb at the Etruscan site of Cerveteri 
(ancient Caere) in central Italy. The story of the Euphronios krater thus shows how far from the truth 
a falsified find-spot and collection history might be.

The author therefore inquired about the likely authenticity of these permits to the Directorate-
General of Antiquities (DGA) of the Lebanese Republic. In response, the DGA answered that based 
on the available information the permits appeared to be authentic. Sarkis El-Khoury, personal com-
munication, 2017. The DGA did issue legal export permits for antiquities prior to the 1990s. These 
documents would normally bear a stamp from the DGA (though no comment was made in the 
DGA response regarding a stamp from the Beirut Museum); they were written in Arabic on official 
letterhead of the DGA; and they “mention the name of the antiquities’ owner, his address and the 
port of export, as well as the destination of the exported antiquities. This is followed by a very brief 
description of the exported antiquities listing the type of objects, the material and the number of 
items.” The translated permits held by the Getty Museum and examined by the author meet all of 
the above criteria.

stamp of the Museum of Beirut,” which was presumably an addendum by Antike 
Kunst Palladion for the Getty Museum).78

The first document dates to 18 March 1974 and is listed as Export Permit no. 
39. It begins by stating that the pieces on the document belong to Hassan Tawil, 
living in Rue Bechara El-Khoury in Beirut, and that they will be sent through cus-
toms at the Beirut airport. It also notes that the Directorate-General is not certain 
that the pieces mentioned in the permit are authentically ancient. An associated 
document states that the pieces were “sold to Hassan Tawil or John Nawad” at an 
address given as Hotel Jura, Basel, Switzerland. The seller’s name is not given. The 
permit itself is vague, stating that it covers “11 petite pièces en bronze, 5 pièces d’or, 
4 statues en argile, 1 pièce en argent” (“11 small pieces in bronze, 5 pieces of gold,  
4 clay statues, 1 piece in silver”).79 The associated document goes on to clarify some 
of the included items: “[C]uillere en argent avec manche decoré; bague en or avec 
pierre tête masculine, diademe en or orné de pierres, statue Assyrienne poterie, vase 
en bronze, pelle en bronze” (“[S]ilver spoon with decorated handle; gold ring with 
stone [showing] a male head, gold diadem adorned with stones,  clay  Assyrian 
statue, bronze vase, bronze shovel” [items from the silver service in boldface]).

The second permit dates to 10 May 1974 and mentions only Hassan Tawil, with 
the same Basel address as before. The permit, no. 61, cites “5 pièces en argent di-
verses  de  genre  et  d’époque”  (“5  pieces  of  silver  of  different  types  and  periods”). 
The sale document clarifying some or all of the objects reads as follows: “2 coupes 
en argent decorées avec anses, aiguillere en argent antique sans decore, vase en argent 
sans decoration, vase forme coupe” (“2 decorated silver cups with handles, antique 
silver needle without decoration, silver vase without decoration, vase in the form 
of a cup”). One more document is from the Directorate-General of Customs and 
confirms to airport customs officials that the objects for the second permit had 
gone through the proper export protocols.80

Unfortunately,  none  of  the  permits  or  associated  documents  unequivocally 
mention the silver jug with the head of a satyr or the aureus.81 The “vase with-
out decoration” may refer to the psykter. Included with the permit documents 
supplied by Antike Kunst Palladion were 10 photographs, illustrating each of 
the eight pieces individually, as well as one photo for each pair of handles for 

78Several attempts were made in early 2017 to contact Hareth Boustany, who seems to have been 
teaching archaeology at the Lebanese University as recently as 2012, but these were not successful.
 79On this document, following the denomination of “5” for the gold pieces, someone has annotated 
the museum’s copy in pencil with “(2)”; following the denomination of “1” for the silver piece, some-
one has also annotated “(X).” The significance of these notes seems to be to mark out which pieces 
covered by the permit were actually acquired by the museum.
80No similar document appears in the Getty Museum’s files for the objects listed in the March permit 
(Permit no. 39), meaning that it is unclear precisely when those objects left Lebanon for Switzerland.
 81The mention of “11 small pieces in bronze” or some of the other bronze objects, however, could 
refer to the “fragmentary bronze vessels” described by Oliver (1980), which were not acquired by the 
museum.

the cups (as these seem to have been detached at the time the photos were made). 
These photos each had a stamp from the Lebanese Directorate-General of Antiq-
uities on the reverse, presumably indicating that they had been shown and verified 
at the time of the issuance of the permits. The photo of the jug in this set of photos 
was identical to one of the photos in Becchina’s archive (Figure 9), but the photo 
of the ladle was different, possibly showing that it had not yet been cleaned prior 
to coming to Switzerland (in Becchina’s image, the tarnish is gone from the handle 
[Figure 11]). The photo of the cup (object 75.AM.54) shows side B/A heavily 
encrusted or tarnished. Becchina’s photo shows side B, which is cleaner, but part of 
side B/A is visible and shows the encrustation, seeming to indicate that this vessel 
had not been cleaned before the permit pictures or Becchina’s archive pictures 
were taken (Figure 12).

The dates on the permits suggest that Becchina could not have shown the silver 
to J. Paul Getty (except perhaps in photos) prior to May 1974. Frel’s story about the 
negotiations (discussed earlier) claimed that the aureus was included with the set by 
this point. Yet neither the coin nor its cast was shown in any photos, raising doubts 
about its connection to the silver and about whether Becchina ever possessed it. 
The full relationship between the permits and the photos supplied by Antike Kunst 
Palladion (and those in the Becchina archive) likewise remains slightly mysterious. 
Specifically, why is the jug not mentioned in the permits even though it appears in 
a photo stamped by the Directorate-General, yet that same photo is in the Becchina 
archives as well as another one showing the vase in clear disrepair prior to conser-
vation? What implications do these confusing facts have for our understanding of 
the service as a unified set?

The “Plastic Cast”

In its 2017 response, the museum also revealed that, although the whereabouts 
of the coin’s “plastic cast” were still unknown, a photograph of the cast had been 
discovered (Figure 15). The picture does appear to represent a cast made from the 
specific coin from the Kastner auction and the Hunt collection, or a facsimile of it, 
though there appear to be cracks in the cast. According to Jeffrey Spier, the pho-
tograph had been made by the museum, but nothing more was known about it, 
including the date it was made. The museum did possess, and even displayed, the 
coin cast at one point, as demonstrated by its mention in the 1978 guide to the col-
lection. According to the guide to the first exhibition in 1976, however, it was not 
on display nor was it even mentioned. Did the cast come with the silver service in 
September 1975? If so, it would have allowed Frel and/or Getty to confirm that the 
coin offered by Nonnweiler a few months later was the same one Becchina claimed 
went with the set and the same one offered at the Kastner auction. Following this 
line of thought further, we may imagine that Becchina told Frel and Getty that the 
coin existed and that he did not have it because it had sold at auction but that he 
knew who did have it: Nonnweiler. Indeed, according to Christos Tsirogiannis,

an affiliate researcher of the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research at the 
University of Glasgow, Becchina’s archive reveals that he was in correspondence 
with Nonnweiler at least between 1974 and August 1978.82 This may have been the 
original method of triangulation concocted by Becchina, Üzülmez, Nonnweiler, 
and perhaps also Frel.83 On the other hand, if the cast arrived between 1976 and 
1978, its presence may have been enough to convince Frel that he did not need the 
original, thus explaining why he stopped trying to acquire the aureus.

Getty Conservation Reports

The Getty Conservation Institute performed routine conservation checks on all of 
the pieces in the service in 2015 and 2016. The author was permitted to examine 
these notes in 2017. According to the notes, some of the pieces required treatment at 
this time—cleaning and/or repair—while the reports on other pieces indicated prior 
service to reattach sections. The objects that required the most extensive attention

seem to have been objects 75.AM.54, 56, 57, and 59 (one of the pair of cups, the tall 
cup, the jug, and the psykter). In the first case, extensive cleaning was needed, and 
this work revealed that the cup liner had adhered to the outer cup casing. Inside, the 
inner portion of the cup casing appeared to have never been cleaned, and it included 
accretions that may have included dirt from the original deposition. Similar traces of 
accretions appeared in smaller quantities on several of the other vessels. It appears 
that no sampling was done of this material. The other three items all showed signs of 
having been reconstructed using an adhesive that ultimately failed: the foot of the tall 
cup became detached; the jug handle became detached; and the neck and rim of the 
psykter separated from the lower part of the vessel. The tall cup also apparently had 
a single handle originally that was indicated by a hole for its attachment; the conser-
vator noted that the handle’s absence may have been caused by damage during burial 
or excavation. These notes therefore give some indication of the state of the artifacts 
when they were discovered. The photographs that accompanied the export permits 
show that major repairs were made to the items before they arrived in Switzerland, 
that these repairs may not have been done entirely professionally, and that the repairs 
were not accompanied by treatment of the surface encrustations or tarnish on the 
silver items in the service.

QUESTIONS

A variety of questions, some already noted, are raised by the different stories associ-
ated with the Getty pieces and the gold coin. These questions relate both to assertions 
made about their collection histories and to gaps in the stories. The primary consid-
eration, however, is to what extent the questions impact our ability to understand 
these objects, their meanings, their significance, and the context in which they were 
created, used, and deposited.

The Silver Service and the Gold Coin

Perhaps the most important question that is raised is whether the evidence sup-
ports the Getty Museum’s story regarding a relationship between their objects and 
the coin. Arguments in favor of believing the museum’s claim of a link to the coin 
rely on accepting that Frel had passed up the opportunity to purchase an object he 
clearly desired and that he apparently believed was linked to other objects already 
in the museum’s collection, even after J. Paul Getty’s death and even though it was 
easily available to him from Nonnweiler or McNall. It also relies on the fact that 
coin dealers and collectors have almost willfully ignored the claimed link for more 
than 40 years, despite the increase in value and interest such a link would provide. 
Arguments in favor of discarding the museum’s claim, on the other hand, include:
 
	 •	 	the	coin’s	failure	to	sell	at	the	Kastner	auction,	despite	repeated	later	claims	to	

the contrary;

	 •	 	the	contemporary	rumors	that	it	was	consigned	to	that	auction	by	Üzülmez,

	 •	 	the	likelihood	that	Nonnweiler’s	letter	falsely	claimed	that	he	possessed	the	coin;
	 •	 	the	report	that	the	coin	passed	from	Üzülmez	through	the	hands	of	McNall,	

another discredited dealer, into the Hunt collection;

	 •	 	the	fact	that	no	images	or	other	contemporary	documentation	have	yet	emerged	

to show that the silver service and the coin were ever in the same location;

	 •	 	the	fact	that	photographs	of	only	three	of	the	objects	from	the	service	appear	in	

Becchina’s archive, while the aureus was absent from the same documents;

	 •	 	the	fact	that	the	Lebanese	export	permits	appear	to	describe	some	of	the	objects	
but that they divided them into at least two groups exported at different moments, 
while omitting at least one object from the service as well as the coin; and, of course,
	 •	 	the	fact	that	no	published	description	of	the	coin	over	at	least	a	37-year	period	
(1973–2010) has ever mentioned the silver service, apart from those put forth 
by the museum. Nor does it appear that any coin dealer, collector, or scholar 
(apart from Spier) was ever aware of the Getty’s story.84

 
It is certainly tantalizing to believe that the coin and silver were found together in 
a late Republican tomb in central Turkey, smuggled out of the country through 
Lebanon by Üzülmez and/or his associates, divided, and offered at auction (the 
coin) and sold or transferred to Becchina (the silver service). As the research 
presented here unfolded, it initially appeared that this would be the correct story. 
Demonstrating a clear link between the coin and the silver might even have bol-
stered a case for restituting the silver to Turkey.

Given the weight of the arguments listed above, though, it now appears that the 
museum’s claim cannot be trusted. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the coin 
is in any way related to the Getty’s silver service. Indeed, as a result of this investi-
gation, the museum now agrees that the evidence to connect the coin to the silver 
is “very tenuous.”85 The coin has turned out to be (in the apt phrase of one of this 
article’s anonymous reviewers) nothing more than a red herring. In an ironic twist, 
and despite the likelihood that these items were illicitly excavated and smuggled 
out of their country of origin, the recognition of this particular red herring means 
that the increased obscurity of the silver service’s real history now likely insulates 
the museum from a claim of restitution from Turkey or any other nation.

In the summer of 2017, the Getty Museum removed any mention of the coin 
from the text that accompanies the re-installed display of the service. The text now 
reads: “These eight objects of exceptionally fine workmanship were probably found 

84Spier was, in fact, the first coin dealer contacted by the present author during this investigation. 
Although he clearly had known about the Getty’s story as early as 1992—since he had published it as 
part of his discussion of the ring—he did not display any particular awareness of the coin’s history 
when asked about it in March 2013.

together in a tomb. The silver vessels formed a set for serving wine. The thin gold 
diadem decorated with garnets and glass likely adorned the body of the deceased.” 
No statement is made about the possible find-spot of the service. The museum has 
maintained its interpretation of dates for the items in the service (“50–25 bc”),  
despite the fact that the coin was the only clear evidence to suggest such a poten-
tially narrow range of years. Perhaps, most notably, the museum has apparently 
declined the opportunity to discuss the background of their acquisition of the sil-
ver service or the change in its interpretation of the service relative to the coin. 
This seems unfortunate as it would have been an excellent chance for the museum 
to educate a public audience about the ways in which institutions like the Getty 
Museum used to operate in the art market and the changes that have been made 
in recent years, particularly in light of the excellent work being carried out by the 
museum’s provenance research team.

The Origins of the Silver Service

In addition to concerns over the dating and geographic context for the silver service, 
our level of skepticism regarding the service may need to be raised even further. For 
there is now no reason to believe even that the objects acquired from Antike Kunst 
Palladion have any relationship to each other.86 As previously noted, only three of 
the pieces (plus an impression from a fourth piece) clearly appear in Becchina’s 
archives, and there is no text description of them or reference to them in these 
documents—only photographs. Perhaps most importantly, the associated export 
permits do not provide a clear picture of the service as a unitary set. The three cups 
in the “set” share formal similarities, especially Cupid motifs, that could certainly 
connect them to each other, but, otherwise, there is simply no independent evi-
dence to support the identification of some or all of these objects as a group.87 This 
is not to claim that they cannot be, or must not be, a group; rather, it is simply to 
clarify precisely what may be said about them with any confidence: almost nothing. 
Andrew Oliver’s 1980 discussion of a possible find-spot around Kayseri, Turkey, 
was an exemplary display by a master scholar of the use of stylistic details and  
research in the form of obscure, but compellingly grounded, comparanda to make 
a case that entices readers to believe that we might be able to reconstruct these 
objects’ histories, even without knowing who found them or when and where they 
were found. Likewise, Susanna Künzl’s theory that the silver vessels were made by 

86The museum’s stated position following presentation of this research is that “in view of style 
and condition we still think it is probable that they constitute a single find.” Jeffrey Spier, personal 
communication, 2017.
 87The two smaller cups can likely be accepted as a pair based on their extremely close resemblance. 
The Cupids on the taller cup were appliqués (one of which is lost), however, while those on the 
shorter cups formed part of their repousée surface decoration. The wings of the Cupid on the taller 
cup are also treated differently, with much thicker, heavier feathers than those on the smaller cups.

the  same  workshop  (discussed  above)  remains  essentially  speculative  in  the 
absence of clear information that they were even found in the same or similar 
location.

A stylistic comparison with other known works introduces still greater compli-
cations. There are, in fact, numerous possible comparanda for the two elaborate 
cups in the service (objects 75.AM.54–55). Two silver cups in the same shape, 
but with a known find-spot, came from Boscoreale, Italy (today in the Louvre), 
and a third, already mentioned, was from Meroë in Sudan (Boston Museum of Fine 
Arts, object 24.971). These items, therefore, do not narrow the potential location 
of discovery for the Getty service. Three more silver cups, recently acquired by the 
Boston Museum of Fine Arts (object 1997.83), the Princeton University Museum 
of Art (object 2000-356), and by the collectors Leon Levy and Shelby White in 
New York, respectively, are virtually identical to the Getty cups in the shape of the 
bowl and have similar handles.88 All three have a Greek name, Sisimis (Boston 
and New York) or Sis (Princeton), inscribed on their feet, perhaps linking them to  
each other.89 The stem and feet of the three cups have markedly different moldings 
from the Getty cups, and they include floral decoration on their feet. They also fea-
ture Cupid-like (albeit wingless) putti who stretch their arms up and across their 
bodies. The paucity of extant ancient silver, however, makes it impossible to know 
how frequently these motifs were used, even by the same workshop. The Boston, 
Princeton, and New York cups all lack published find-spots, and the Boston Museum of 
Fine Art reports on its online catalogue that it acquired its cup from Robert Hecht.90 
Michael Padgett, curator of antiquities at the Princeton museum, wrote that Hecht 
was not the source of his institution’s cup, but he declined to indicate who the seller 
was, stating that it is the museum’s policy to withhold that information.91

Two more cups, again without a known find-spot, were also in the Levy-White 
collection, one with the name Sisimis (or similar) incised on its foot, but these had 
high-swung kantharoid handles and a different treatment of the foot from the trio 

88The identities of the collectors who own the third cup were given by Andrew Oliver, personal com-
munication, 2017; in his 2004 article, the location of the cup is simply given as “private collection, 
New York.” Oliver 2004.
 89Oliver 2004, 2. Oliver suggested that silver cups of this type were made and sold in pairs. The sudden and 
recent appearance on the market of three such similar cups, two of which likely have the same name on 
them, is striking and may indicate that they initially formed part of a group illicitly excavated together.
 90Specifically, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston states that the cup had been left to Hecht in 1959 
by his father, who had acquired it from a London dealer named Kenneth John Hewett earlier 
in the same decade. Museum of Fine Arts Boston, http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/two- 
handled-cup-skyphos-with-bacchic-scene-45948 (accessed 4 September 2017). Hecht’s proclivity for 
inventing collection histories for looted antiquities is well documented (see note 69 above). More-
over, Hecht stated in his memoirs that he and Hewett were close friends and that they traveled to 
Turkey together in 1962 to buy antiquities, at least some of which were unprovenanced. Norman 
2014, 18–19, 21. Only pieces with independent documentation of their origins and whereabouts prior 
to passing through his hands should therefore be trusted to be licit.

published by Oliver.92 Finally, in 2003, Cornelius Vermeule published yet another  
silver cup (missing its handles, stem, and foot) with the same shape as the cups 
with handles in the Getty service. This cup was in “a private collection in southern  
California … known to specialists in Greek and Roman plate for a number of 
years. … [and] said to have been found in the lands of Roman Imperial Parthia” 
(the Parthian homeland was in northeastern Iran, but in the early Roman empire, 
the boundaries of their territory included parts of modern Turkey, Syria, Jordan, 
Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan).93 Vermeule compared the pri-
vately owned cup to another one in the Toledo Museum (object 1961.9; no find-
spot; “place of origin: Ancient Rome, from Asia Minor”). Vermeule’s conclusion 
was that the California cup was made in a Phrygian city—that is, western inland 
Asia Minor—in the Augustan or Julio-Claudian period, but given the lack of 
find-spots for both this example and the Toledo comparandum, there is simply 
no secure evidence on which to base this argument. Indeed, a list (not necessarily 
comprehensive) provided to the author by Andrew Oliver included 35 Roman silver 
cups attributed to the first century bc or the first century ad—though not the two 
in the Getty service—that had emerged on the American art market.94 Of these, 
only two (5.7 percent) had known find-spots: the cup from Meroë and another 
one from Vicarello, Italy, in the Cleveland Museum (object 1966.371). If the Getty 
cups are included, the percentage of grounded examples out of all early imperial 
Roman silver cups in the United States drops to 5.4 percent.

The reality, unfortunately, is that because the Getty silver service and the aureus 
came to market without a collection history or a find-spot; because they are associ-
ated with dealers known or alleged to traffic in illicit antiquities; because the silver 
service was acquired by a curator who was documented as having actively broken 
both laws and ethical guidelines in the name of building a world-class collection, 
and the aureus by collectors who were unconcerned with a lack of transparency 
with regard to the origins of their purchase; and because hardly any similar examples 
have a known find-spot either—for all of these reasons and in spite of the presence 
of apparently authentic export permits—the Getty silver service and the aureus of 
Mark Antony and Antyllus now can tell us practically nothing about the ancient 
Mediterranean, except merely that these objects existed. With the collapse of the 
Getty Museum’s story about the silver service and the coin, our hope of under-
standing the service’s provenance, its date, and the objects’ relationship to people 
(and other objects) in the distant past simply evaporate.

Although it is true that we can study the style, iconography, and manufacture of 
these objects, as many scholars have done, this information is ultimately not very 
useful to art historians and archaeologists if we cannot also say where or when they  
were made or why. We are left unable to identify, for example, whether what might 
appear to be stylistic similarities signify chronological contemporaneity, archaiz-
ing tendencies, the influence of one period or artist on another, or simply pure 
coincidence. Comparison with another well-known category of ancient artifacts— 
painted Athenian pottery—shows the problems faced by Roman silver. J.D. Beazley’s 
famous attributions of artist names to Athenian vases in the twentieth century were 
only useful for understanding the development of painting and the ancient Athenian 
pottery industry because we can be sure from scientifically recorded finds and 
scientific sampling of clay sources and vessels that the vases were made in Athens 
and because there is enough other corroborating archaeologically sourced data to 
mostly confirm their chronological seriation.

Otherwise the system is a house of cards—guesswork that has been given a 
veneer of logic and authority. In classic articles on the intellectual consequences of 
the art market’s esteem for antiquities in 1993 and 2000, Christopher Chippindale 
and David Gill demonstrated this loss of critically important contextual information 
when looted antiquities are acquired through the legitimate art market.95 Elizabeth 
Marlowe’s recent study of the “core” works of Roman art history, many of them 
having surfaced in unclear circumstances, further demonstrates the problems that 
such objects create for scholarly understandings of the past.96 Gill also criticizes, 
primarily together with Michael Vickers, the effect of the modern art market 
on the study of painted Greek pottery as artwork, relative to the objects we believe 
to have been much more highly prized in antiquity—silver and gold plate.97 The 
unfortunate fact is that it is currently almost impossible to make clear comparisons 
that would elucidate the relationship between ceramic and metal art production, 
not only because the vast majority of metal vessels were recycled into other objects 
but  also  because  almost  none  of  what  does  survive  has  a  known  find-spot  and, 
therefore, a clear date or context for its production and use.

Attempted (but Failed) Recontextualization: Worth the Effort?

In the case of the Getty silver and the aureus, even though it was possible to learn 
a great deal that was previously unknown about these objects over the more than 
four years of painstaking research, such as Nonnweiler’s offer of the coin to the 
museum in 1975 or the rumors circulating around the Kastner auction in 1973,

we are ultimately left with a story whose foundation is made of quicksand. This 
experience suggests, then, that Malcolm Bell’s success during the 1990s in recon-
structing the provenance of the Morgantina silver is likely the exception rather 
than the rule. Even the existence of an archive of documents collected by a dealer 
involved in the trade of looted antiquities; the seizure of that archive by law enforce-
ment authorities; and the cooperation of the museum that acquired the group of 
objects from the dealer, which allowed this researcher to examine the relevant files, 
is not sufficient in this case, or (one would therefore have to surmise) in many 
similar cases where less information is preserved, to re-establish the original find-
spot of this group of objects. In this way, the intellectual consequences of collecting 
antiquities signaled by Gill and Chippindale are all the more starkly underlined.

Even what has been learned in this case is largely due to the particular willing-
ness of some (but not all) knowledgeable parties to speak on the subject, since there 
is little published or archival material that can be brought to bear on it (hence,  
the reliance on “personal communications,” rather than on documents, to add 
important details to the story as well as the frequent use of words and phrases such as 
“reportedly” and “stated to be”). There is very little that can be stated with full confi-
dence about the silver or the coin. The Getty silver service is thus a prime example—
and a depressing reminder—of what has been lost due to looting and the desire to 
collect ancient objects even when they have no find-spot or collection history. The 
Getty Museum’s recent exhibition of the Berthouville silver, whose nineteenth- 
century discovery and ancient context are well understood further emphasize this 
loss.98 The Berthouville set, a third-century ad cache from Normandy, France, con-
sisting of a mixed set of vessels apparently dating to several periods, was found in 
a sanctuary. It speaks eloquently to the ways in which ancient Roman worship prac-
tices, tradition, and luxury could intersect, even in rural parts of far-flung provinces. 
Nothing like that is now possible with the Getty silver or the coin.

At the same time, there is some value in attempting to reconstruct the histories 
of ungrounded objects wherever some evidence might exist. In the case of the coin, 
it appears possible, and perhaps even likely, that it was looted from a Turkish con-
text and offered for sale with several other looted coins (including the finest ex-
ample of the earliest known coin in the world).99 As for the Getty silver, we have 
learned how little we can trust the stories put forward by dealers, even when the 
objects in question are accompanied by legitimate export documents. It also hints 
at what was previously known about networks of dealers who worked together to 
try to move objects into collections, now showing that this might have happened 
irrespective of whether the objects were actually related to each other. This will be 
an important subject for future researchers to consider further as they examine the 
trafficking of illicit antiquities and the possible invention of false relationships to 
create desire among collectors. Finally, this example shows that even the presence

of legitimate export documentation is not clear proof of a licit origin. In this sense, 
a failed recontextualization is valuable mostly for showing what we still have to 
learn about what we do not know.
