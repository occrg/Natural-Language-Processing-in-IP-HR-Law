Football Dataco v Yahoo! Implications of the ECJ
judgment
David Rose and Nina O’Sullivan*

The development of the law relating to the protection
of databases in the EU has been driven, to a consider-
able extent, by a line of cases relating to sporting data
held in ‘sole source databases’, such as football ﬁxture
lists and horseracing data. Some eight years after its
landmark judgments
in British Horseracing Board
(BHB)1 and Fixtures Marketing Limited (FML),2 where
it held that the sui generis database right in the Data-
base Directive 96/9 did not protect the investment in
‘creating’ data, the Court of Justice of the European
Union (ECJ) has now considered, in Football Dataco v
Yahoo!,3 whether, database copyright will protect foot-
ball ﬁxture lists and comparable databases either.

Aside from the implications for sports governing
bodies (which have enjoyed considerable revenues by li-
censing their sporting ﬁxtures lists and similar data),
Yahoo also forces the English common lawyer to con-
sider whether, and to what extent,
the originality
threshold he has been familiar with for so many years
is undergoing a fundamental re-appraisal. This is espe-
cially so when this decision is considered against the
backdrop of a number of recent ECJ decisions concern-
ing the threshold requirement of originality, notably in
Infopaq,4 BSA,5 Painer,6 FAPL7 and more recently in
SAS v WPL.8

Protection of databases pre-Database
Directive
Prior to the implementation of the Directive in UK
law, football ﬁxture lists (and other such lists) had long
been held protectable by copyright. Indeed, as Floyd J
observed at ﬁrst instance in Football Dataco v Yahoo!,9
this question had been regarded as settled following the

are not protected by the sui generis database right).
† A ‘database’ will only qualify for copyright pro-

phasis on creative endeavour, with potential
implications for copyright subsistence beyond
the speciﬁc species of copyright that are the

rights and software copyright).

1959 decision in Football League Ltd v Littlewoods Pools
Ltd.10

In Littlewoods Pools, Upjohn J held:

Copyright for such a compilation [ie a ﬁxture list] can be
claimed successfully if it be shown that some labour, skill,
judgment or ingenuity has been brought to bear upon the
compilation. The amount of labour, skill, judgement or in-
genuity required to support successfully a claim for copy-
right is a question of fact and degree in every case.11

Upjohn J rejected Littlewoods’s submission that the
skill and labour expended by the Football League was
focused on creating a programme of football games and
not to reducing that information to a material form. In
assessing the amount of skill,
labour and judgement
which went into a compilation the court had to have
‘regard to the whole history, including any work done
to bring the data into existence in the ﬁrst place’.12

Although Littlewoods was decided under the Copy-
right Act 1956, the successor statute, the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), continued to
protect compilations (including ﬁxture lists) as literary
works.

The test for originality of a database as a compil-
ation pre-Database Directive under English law was the
same as for all other copyright works: it had to be ori-
ginal in the sense that it had not been copied and it
had to be the subject of some labour, skill or judge-
ment. This relatively low threshold for originality had
been conﬁrmed in Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William
Hill (Football) Ltd13 (concerning a ﬁxed odds betting
coupon), the House of Lords holding originality was a
‘matter of degree depending on the amount of skill,
judgement or labour that has been involved in making
the compilation’.14

The Database Directive
The Directive introduced two forms of protection for
databases which are considered below: sui generis data-
base right and database copyright. The Directive
deﬁnes ‘database’ for both the sui generis right and
copyright at Article 1(2) as ‘ . . . a collection of inde-
pendent works, data or other materials arranged in a
systematic or methodical way and individually access-

ible by electronic or other means’. This broad deﬁnition
will include most databases, including, for example, a
street or telephone directory and a customer list.

As the ECJ conﬁrmed in FML, the deﬁnition is
broad enough to include football ﬁxture lists. In that
case the ECJ held that the compilation of dates, times,
and names of football teams relating to various differ-
ent football ﬁxtures in the form of a ﬁxture list was a
collection of independent materials and met the condi-
tions as to systematic or methodical arrangement and
individual accessibility.15

The protection afforded under

the Directive,
whether by copyright or database right,
is only for
‘databases’ which meet the deﬁnition in Article 1(2). In
Football Dataco v Yahoo!, no doubt given the ﬁnding in
FML, the defendants accepted that football ﬁxture lists
were databases within the meaning of Article 1(2).16

Two-tier protection
The sui generis database right and database copyright
are independent of each other (although both may
subsist in respect of the same database), with different
conditions for subsistence, duration and infringement.
A database in which copyright subsists will enjoy pro-
tection for the life of the author plus 70 years.17 The
term of protection for the sui generis database right is
15 years from the end of the calendar year in which the
database was completed (unless it was made available
to the public before the end of this period, in which
case it will last for 15 years from the end of the year in
which it was made available to the public).18

The sui generis database right protects the invest-
ment employed in obtaining, verifying and presenting
the contents of a database. Database copyright protects
the intellectual creation involved in the selection and
arrangement of the data within the database, ie the
structure of the database and not the individual con-
tents (although they may be the subject of separate
copyright protection).

This

structure/contents dichotomy follows

from
Recitals 15 and 58, and Article 3(2) which provide:

18 Although a regularly updated database probably enjoys a rolling 15-year

period of protection: Art 10(3) of the Directive provides that

Any substantial change, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, to the
contents of a database, including any substantial change resulting from
the accumulation of successive additions, deletions or alterations,
which would result in the database being considered to be a substantial
new investment, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, shall qualify
the database resulting from that
for its own term of
protection.

should be deﬁned to the fact that the selection or ar-
rangement of the contents of the database is the
author’s own intellectual creation; whereas such pro-
tection should cover the structure of the database.’
† Recital 58—‘Whereas, in addition to the protection
given under this Directive to the structure of the
database by copyright, and to its contents against
unauthorised extraction and/or re-utilisation under
the sui generis right. . . .’
† Article 3(2)—‘The copyright protection of databases
provided for by this Directive shall not extend to
their contents and shall be without prejudice to any
rights subsisting in those contents themselves.’

However, as noted in Laddie, Prescott & Vitoria,19 the
‘precise ambit of the matter which is properly the
subject of copyright in a database is not clear’, and
the content/structure division is perhaps not as obvious
as often suggested. While arrangement of the contents of
a database is part of its structure, selection of the con-
tents may, if constituting the author’s own intellectual
creation, be the subject of copyright protection. This,
they note, extends to the contents as a body regardless
of the structure of the database (arguing that Article
3(2) prohibits database copyright for the contents indi-
vidually, as opposed to the contents as a whole body).

Database copyright: Article 3
Article 3(1) provides that ‘databases which, by reason
of the selection or arrangement of their contents, con-
stitute the author’s own intellectual creation shall be
protected as such by copyright. No other criteria shall
be applied to determine their eligibility for protection.’
In the UK, a new s 3A was introduced into the
CDPA by the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regu-
lations 1997. Section 3A(2) provides that ‘ . . . a literary
work consisting of a database is original if, and only if,
by reason of the selection or arrangement of the con-
tents of
the database the database constitutes the
author’s own intellectual creation’.

The key phrase is ‘the author’s own intellectual cre-
ation’. While this phrase was used in UK legislation for
the ﬁrst time in this provision, it had already featured
in other European legislation as a condition for copy-

right protection. The wording derives from Article 2(5)
of the Berne Convention20 and also appears in Article
10(2) of TRIPS in relation to computer programs and
compilations of data.21 It has long been a feature of
copyright subsistence in civil law jurisdictions.

‘a

that

Aside from the Directive, ‘author’s own intellectual
creation’ has been used in the context of subsistence of
copyright in computer programs, Article 1(3) of the
Software Directive22 providing
computer
program shall be protected if it is original in the sense
that it is the author’s own intellectual creation. No
other criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility
for protection.’ It is also used in relation to photo-
graphs, in Article 6 of the Term Directive,23 which pro-
vides that ‘photographs which are original in the sense
that they are the author’s own intellectual creation shall
be protected . . . ’.

The concept of ‘author’s own intellectual creation’
does not, however, get an explicit mention in the Infor-
mation Society Directive24 (also known as ‘the Copy-
right Directive’). A key purpose of
the Copyright
Directive was to harmonize the scope of the copyright
owner’s rights rather than to establish threshold levels
of protection. However, questions of subsistence and
infringement are
inevitably intertwined. This was
acknowledged in the ECJ’s decision in Infopaq,
in
which it was required to consider Article 2 of the
Copyright Directive which provides
‘Member
States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise
or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent
reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole
or in part for authors, of their works.’

that

The ECJ held that it was apparent from the general
scheme of the Berne Convention, in particular Article
2(5) and (8), that the protection of certain subject
matters as artistic or literary works presupposed that
they were intellectual creations (as noted, this position
is supported by the Directives protecting computer pro-
grams, databases and photographs). Since the Copyright
Directive had established a harmonized legal framework
for copyright, a literary work would only be protected
by copyright under Article 2(a) if it was original in the
sense that it was its author’s own intellectual creation.25

in dispute in Infopaq), the ECJ held that the author’s
own intellectual creation would be evidenced clearly
from the form, the manner in which the subject was pre-
sented and in the linguistic expression. The words them-
selves,
in isolation, were not as such an intellectual
creation of the author; ‘it was only through the choice,
sequence and combination of those words that the
author may express his creativity in an original manner
and achieve a result which is an intellectual creation’.26
As a result, the ECJ held, it was possible that certain iso-
lated sentences or parts of sentences (including 11-word
extracts) could constitute an element which was,
in
itself, an expression of the author’s intellectual creation.
The ECJ considered ‘author’s own intellectual cre-
ation’ further in BSA, which concerned a graphic user
interface (GUI). The ECJ held that the GUI did not
constitute a form of expression of a computer program
within Article 1(2) of the Software Directive. However,
following Infopaq, a GUI could be protected by
copyright under the Copyright Directive if it was its
author’s own intellectual creation. The national court
was required to take into account the speciﬁc arrange-
ment or conﬁguration of all the components which
formed part of the GUI in order to determine whether
they met the criterion of originality. In particular, com-
ponents which were ‘differentiated only by their tech-
nical function’ had to be excluded as they did ‘not
permit the author to express his creativity in an origin-
al manner and achieve a result which is an intellectual
creation of that author’.27

In contrast, in Football Association Premier
League, the ECJ held, applying Infopaq, that
there was no copyright in a sporting event such as

a football match

The ECJ considered Article 6 of the Term Directive in
Painer, a case concerning portrait photographs. It re-
ferred to Recital 17 of that Directive, which provides
that a photographic work will be considered original ‘if
it is the author’s own intellectual creation reﬂecting his
personality, no other criteria such as merit or purpose
being taken into account’. The ECJ decided that a
photograph would reﬂect the author’s personality if the

29 Ibid, para 92.

author ‘was able to express his creative abilities in the
production of the work by making free and creative
choices’,28 eg in the context of a portrait photograph in
choosing the background, the subject’s pose and the
lighting, as well as the framing, angle of view and at-
mosphere, and in adopting a choice of developing tech-
nique. In making those various choices, the author of a
portrait photograph was able to ‘stamp the work
created with his “personal touch”’.29

In contrast, in Football Association Premier League,
the ECJ held, applying Infopaq, that there was no copy-
right in a sporting event such as a football match.
Given its origin in rules, there was no room for creative
freedom for the purposes of establishing intellectual
creation.30

Subsequent

to its decision in Football Dataco v
Yahoo!, in SAS v WPL, the ECJ held that the functional-
ity of a computer program, its programming language
and the format of data ﬁles did not constitute a ‘form
of expression’ of that program under Article 1(2) of the
Software Directive. However, following BSA, the SAS
programming language and format of
its data ﬁles
could enjoy protection under Article 2(a) of the Copy-
right Directive if they amounted to the author’s own
intellectual creation.31

Football Dataco v Yahoo! presented the ﬁrst oppor-
tunity for the courts to interpret Article 3 of the Dir-
ective. In deﬁning the requirement of originality by
reference to the author’s own intellectual creation, it
had generally been accepted that Article 3(1) had
clearly ‘raised the bar’32 in respect of copyright protec-
tion of databases in the UK. As Laddie, Prescott &
Vitoria put it, however, it did not just impose a higher
standard for protection:

The new requirement is not just a raising of the threshold.
It imposes a requirement which is fundamentally different
in kind. First it restricts consideration only to the arrange-
ment or selection of the contents. So the skill and labour
in gathering (as opposed to any selection) or verifying is
not relevant. More fundamentally the database must, when
these two factors are considered, constitute its author’s
own intellectual creation. This imposes a signiﬁcant quali-
tative factor on the test. . . . It is submitted that there must
be something which has had the author’s creativity
stamped upon it. By this we mean that it must be some-
thing which could not be something which could fairly be
said to be something which could have been created by

many others. There must be some ‘subjective’ contribu-
tion. A ‘sweat of the brow’ collection will not do.33

The ‘suigeneris’ database right: Article 7
The ECJ had already had occasion to interpret
the
proper scope of the sui generis database right in four
landmark decisions in November 2004, all of which con-
cerned sporting data—BHB, a reference from the English
Court of Appeal concerning pre-race horse riding data;
and FML, three references respectively from Finland,
Sweden and Greece, concerning football ﬁxture lists.

Article 7 provides that the sui generis database right
gives protection to the maker of a database where ‘ . . .
there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a sub-
stantial investment in either the obtaining, veriﬁcation
or presentation of the contents to prevent extraction
and/or re-utilisation of the whole or of a substantial
part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of
the contents of that database’.

The BHB, as the ofﬁcial governing body of

the
British horseracing industry, compiled and maintained
pre-race horse racing data (‘the runners and riders
database’). It brought proceedings against William Hill
for infringement of sui generis database right arising
from William Hill’s unauthorized use of the data (but
did not include a claim for database copyright infringe-
ment).

At trial, William Hill did not dispute that the sui
generis database right protected the BHB database.
Instead, it submitted, inter alia, that the scope of pro-
tection was narrow and there had to be the taking of
some unfair advantage of the ‘databaseness’ of the data-
base, ie the manner in which the contents of the data-
base were arranged. The Court of Appeal thought that
the scope of protection was not clear and referred nu-
merous questions to the ECJ, although it effectively
assumed that the database qualiﬁed for protection.

The ECJ held that the ‘runners and riders’ database
was not protected by the sui generis database right. It
drew a clear distinction between investment in the cre-
ation of the underlying information and investment in
storing and processing information in a database. Only
the latter type of investment attracted protection under
the sui generis right. Of central importance to its reason-
ing was the purpose of the Directive, as set out in Reci-
tals 9, 10 and 12, ie promotion and protection of the
investment in data ‘storage’ and ‘processing’ systems.

In a key passage, it held that Article 7

33 Para 32.29.
34 BHB, above, n 1, para 31.
35 See C-444/02 FML, para 49.

. . . must . . . be understood to refer to the resources used
to seek out existing independent materials and collect
them in the database, and not to the resources used for the
creation as such of independent materials. The purpose of
the protection by the sui generis right . . . is to promote the
establishment of storage and processing systems for exist-
ing information and not the creation of materials capable
of being collected subsequently in a database.34

In FML, the claimant (a company connected with Foot-
ball Dataco, responsible for exploitation of ﬁxture lists
outside of the UK) brought actions in Finland, Sweden
and Greece for infringement of database right in football
ﬁxture lists. The ECJ held that the investment was again
of the ‘wrong sort’ in that the resources deployed by
FML in determining ﬁxtures, dates and times, was done
in the context of arranging the ﬁxtures and represented
investment
themselves.
Further, ﬁnding and collecting the data making up foot-
ball ﬁxture lists did not require any particular effort on
behalf of the Leagues and were activities which were ‘ . . .
indivisibly linked to the creation of those data’.35

in the creation of

the lists

Both BHB and FML were decisions of the Grand
Chamber of the ECJ. They were highly controversial
decisions, given the strict dividing line the ECJ had
drawn between investment in the creation of data and
investment in collection of existing independent data.
As Laddie, Prescott & Vitoria suggested, the decisions
were based ﬁrmly in policy, ie promotion of the estab-
lishment of storage and processing systems comprising
existing information and not the creation of a new
property right in the data themselves.36

The effect of the ECJ’s decisions was to reduce dra-
matically the protection available to those involved in
creating data such as the BHB and FML. Doubts were
widely expressed as to the value of the sui generis right
as a form of protection for databases, given the ECJ’s
narrow interpretation, with database creators looking
to adopt different processes to ensure there was inde-
pendent and substantial investment in veriﬁcation and
presentation of data as opposed to their creation.

However, while such collections of data have been

behalf of the claimants, the lists being created using pre-

existing information—but what resulted was new infor-
mation. Sky, however, did not create new information
when it entered a customer’s details into its database but
simply recorded pre-existing information in a systematic
way. Similarly, in Football Dataco v Sportradar, Floyd J,
in holding that ‘Football Live’ was protected by database
right, gave the following explanation:

. . . . Data which is created by an individual or organisa-
tion is, in most cases at least, not available to others until
it is created. There is, accordingly, no alternative source for
such data. If one allows a database right to attach to data
which is created by the maker of the database, the creator
obtains a true monopoly in that data. Such a result would
be inconsistent with the objectives of the Directive. The
Directive should not be construed in a way which gives a
party a monopoly in facts, such as the runners and riders
or the ﬁxture lists. On the other hand where a database
consists of data obtained from sources available to the
public, such as existing published data, the balance of
policy considerations is different. There is (or should be)
nothing to prevent the public from investing in obtaining
those data themselves. The owner of a database right in
data which is obtained in this way does not achieve a
stranglehold on the facts. The objectives of the Directive
are therefore furthered by encouraging investment in the
obtaining, veriﬁcation and presentation of data, without
creating monopolies in fact.38

Given the rejection of the sui generis database right as a
method of protection, the focus subsequently moved to
database copyright
football
ﬁxture lists. In March 2010, Floyd J delivered judgment
on a preliminary issue as to which rights, if any, sub-
sisted in the ﬁxture lists for the English and Scottish
Premier Leagues and football leagues.

for databases

such as

Football Dataco, which exploits data and rights in
connection with those leagues and together with them,
brought proceedings against a number of betting com-
panies and Yahoo!, relying upon database copyright,
the sui generis database right and also on copyright in
the lists as a table or compilation other than a database.
They submitted detailed evidence as to the annual pro-
duction of the ﬁxture lists, the process comprising
various stages including preparation of an initial sched-
ule, sending out and analysis of ﬁxture questionnaires
to clubs, acts of sequencing and pairing to produce
draft lists and reviewing of those lists. This process was
subject throughout to the so-called ‘golden rules’:

matches (ie no HHH or AAA);

four home matches or
AAHAA is not permissible);

† No club shall have three consecutive home or away
† In any ﬁve consecutive matches, no club shall have
four away matches (eg
† As far as possible, each club should have played an
equal number of home and away matches at all
times during the season; and
† All clubs should have as near as possible an equal

number of home and away mid-week matches.

The individual responsible for producing the lists on
behalf of Football Dataco and the Leagues described the
process in his evidence as a ‘mixture of science and art’.

Floyd J made the following ﬁndings of fact:

1. The process involved ‘ . . . very signiﬁcant labour and
skill in satisfying the multitude of often competing
requirements’ and was ‘ . . . not entirely deterministic’.
2. The process was not one where everyone would come
up with the same answer. Some solutions accommo-
dated clubs’ requirements more than others.

3. The work was ‘ . . . not mere “sweat of the brow”’, in-
volving ‘application of rigid criteria to the processing
of data’. A telephone directory would involve mere
application of rigid criteria but here, there was, at
each stage, scope for the application of judgement
and skill. Unlike a sweat of the brow compilation,
some solutions would work better, others would not
work at all. The quality of the solution depended in
part upon the skill of those involved.

4. To the extent

that computers were used in the
process, they did not eliminate the use of judgement
and discretion.

Applying FML, Floyd J held that the ﬁxture lists were
not protected by the sui generis database right. He also
rejected the claim to copyright infringement irrespect-
ive of the Directive.

In relation to database copyright, however, Floyd J
held that ‘selection or arrangement’ for the purposes of
Article 3 did not exclude selection or arrangement deci-
sions taken during the creation of the data. He distin-
guished BHB and FML, stressing that care should be
taken before applying the ECJ’s reasoning to a case
under Article 3. The purpose of the two rights was differ-
ent, the purpose of copyright being to encourage creative
endeavour, whereas the sui generis right was designed to
promote investment in particular types of data gather-

ing. He noted that the process of selection and arrange-
ment of the contents of a database often began before all
the data are created: ‘to cut out from consideration these
selection decisions, merely because they occur whilst the
database is being created, seems to me to be arbitrary,
and conceptually fraught with difﬁculty . . . ’.39

Floyd J next considered whether that selection or ar-
rangement of the data constituted the author’s own in-
tellectual creation. He referred to the compilation CD
example in Recital 19 of the Directive40 and suggested
that it implied that such a selection did not have
‘ . . . How much is good
enough of
enough is not made clear, and will no doubt vary from
case to case. The quality in question is the author’s in-
dividual creativity.’41

some quality:

Citing with approval the statement in Laddie, Prescott
& Vitoria that there had to be ‘something which has had
the author’s creativity stamped upon it’, Floyd J
concluded that database copyright did subsist in the
lists. There was relevant selection and arrangement in
the choice of dates and the decisions as to which match
was played on which date which did, in his judgement,
constitute the author’s own intellectual creation. There
were numerous stages through the process of allocating
matches to dates and in selecting the dates themselves
where the producer of the lists had to exercise judge-
ment and discretion. The work done was quantitatively
sufﬁcient (no two ﬁxtures could be freely changed
without affecting another) and was more substantial
than that involved in Recital 19’s CD example.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal (for which Jacob LJ
gave the judgment) held42 that the question of copy-
right subsistence under Article 3 was not acte clair (it
upheld Floyd J’s decision on sui generis database right)
and decided to refer the following questions to the
ECJ:

What is meant by ‘databases which, by reason of the selec-
tion or arrangement of
their contents, constitute the
author’s own intellectual creation’ and in particular:

(a) Should the intellectual effort and skill of creating

data be excluded?

(b) Does ‘selection or arrangement’ include adding im-
portant signiﬁcance to a pre-existing item of data (as in
ﬁxing the date of a football match)?

(c) Does ‘author’s own intellectual creation’ require
more than signiﬁcant labour and skill from the author, if
so what?

Unusually, Jacob LJ expressed no view as to which of the
rival contentions was correct in relation to (a), ﬁnding
merit in both. If the claimants’ arguments were adopted,
the BHB and FML rulings would be ineffective—the
‘lesser’ form of protection in the form of database right
would not be available but copyright would, with conse-
quences for other databases containing created data
which involved a ‘great deal of time, energy and skill’
such as TV listings. However, there was considerable
skill and judgement in creating the ﬁxture lists which
was arguably ‘arranging or
(ie the
matches to be played) as well as creating data (ﬁxing the
dates).

selecting data’

the work of

Jacob LJ also expressed doubts as to interpretation
of ‘the author’s own intellectual creation’: Article 3 did
not include a criterion of ‘artistic skill’ but required
that
selecting and arranging be the
‘author’s own intellectual creation’. While this would
exclude mere mechanistic ‘sweat of brow’ databases, it
was ‘far from self-evident that other, truly creative but
not artistic, work is excluded. Quite what the meaning
and limits of “author’s own intellectual creation” is
also . . . a question calling for an answer.’43

Finally, there was enough of a ‘lingering doubt’ to
refer a question on the issue of whether, post the Dir-
ective, national laws as to copyright subsistence in data-
bases were preserved.

The ECJ’s judgment
The ECJ ruled on 1 March 2012 that the Directive
precluded reliance on pre-Directive national
legisla-
copyright protection. The whole
tion affording
the Directive was to remove disparities
purpose of
between national
legislation in relation to the
scope and conditions of copyright protection for
databases.

The ECJ emphasized that, as Article 3(2) and Recital
15 made clear, Article 3(1) afforded copyright protec-
tion to the ‘structure’ of the database and not to its
‘contents’. The intellectual effort and skill of creating
data were not relevant under Article 3(1) as the con-
cepts of ‘selection’ and of ‘arrangement’ referred re-
spectively to the selection and arrangement of data,
through which the author of the database gave it its
structure. Those concepts did not extend to the cre-
ation of the data contained in the database.44 Accord-

ingly, the intellectual effort and skill in creating the
data in Football Dataco’s ﬁxture lists were irrelevant to
the assessment of database copyright protection.

The ECJ said that its analysis was conﬁrmed by the
Directive’s purpose, following BHB and FML. As stated
in Recitals 9, 10 and 12, this was to stimulate the cre-
ation of data storage and processing systems, not to
protect the creation of materials capable of being col-
lected in a database. Football Dataco’s
intellectual
resources were deployed in arranging the leagues for
determining the relevant ﬁxtures, in accordance with a
set of rules, parameters, and organisational constraints,
as well as the speciﬁc requests of the clubs concerned.
As such, they related to the creation of the same data
which were in the database and were of no relevance.45
This effectively resolved the issue of database copy-
right protection, but the ECJ then gave guidance as to
‘author’s own intellectual creation’. It referred to Recital
16 which provides: ‘Whereas no criterion other than ori-
ginality in the sense of the author’s own intellectual cre-
ation should be applied to determine the eligibility of
the database for copyright protection, and in particular
no aesthetic or qualitative criteria should be applied.’
It then applied its interpretation of the originality re-
quirement as developed in Infopaq, BSA, FAPL and
Painer, to the setting up of a database. It held that the
originality criterion would be satisﬁed in the setting up
of a database where ‘ . . . through the selection or ar-
rangement of the data which it contains, its author
expresses his creative ability in an original manner by
making free and creative choices . . . and thus stamps his
“personal touch”’.46 However, as in BSA and FAPL, it
would not be satisﬁed where the setting up of the database
was ‘ . . . dictated by technical considerations, rules or con-
straints which leave no room for creative freedom’.47

Accordingly, the ECJ concluded that signiﬁcant labour
and skill in setting up a database (irrespective of the data
which it contains) would only qualify a database for
copyright protection if it expressed originality in the se-
lection or arrangement of the data. Whilst the Court of
Appeal had to determine whether Football Dataco’s
ﬁxture lists are protected by copyright,48 the ECJ did not
give it much scope for manoeuvre, expressing the clear
view that its procedures for creating the lists would not
sufﬁce, unless they were supplemented by elements that
did reﬂect originality in the selection or arrangement of
the data.49

independent data. Recent examples

A ﬁnal resolution
The position as to what database copyright and the sui
generis database right protect appears to have been
ﬁnally resolved:
† The individual contents of a database may be pro-
tected by copyright if they meet the relevant require-
ments e.g. in a list of poems, the individual poems
will be protected by copyright. However, the con-
tents of a ﬁxture list or other similar list of informa-
tion will not be protected by copyright.
† The contents of a database may be protected by the
sui generis database right if there is sufﬁcient invest-
ment in obtaining, verifying or presenting pre-exist-
ing,
include
customer databases (BSkyB v Digital Warranty), a
list of 1100 German poems (Directmedia Publishing
GmbH v Albert-Ludwigs-Universita¨t Freiburg),50 a
database of individuals associated with a GP practice
(Beechwood House Publishing Ltd v Guardian Pro-
ducts Ltd)51 and a list of ‘PM Abs’ or permanent
memory absolute addresses
for mobile phones
(Forensic Telecommunications Services Ltd v Chief
Constable of West Yorkshire Police).52
† The structure of a database may be protected by data-
base copyright if it can be shown that, in the setting
up of the database and through the selection or ar-
rangement of
its author
expressed his creative ability in an original manner by
making free and creative choices, thereby stamping
his ‘personal touch’. Database copyright will not be
available where the setting up of the database is dic-
tated by technical considerations, rules or constraints
which leave no room for creative freedom. An
example of a list that may qualify could be a list of
‘Europe’s 50 Most Brilliant Lawyers’—such a list
would require the author to exercise creative freedom
in identifying the individuals to include in the list.
† A work which falls outside the deﬁnition of a data-
base in Article 1(2) may still be protected in copy-
right under the CDPA as a compilation.
† There appears to be little remaining scope for pro-
tection of ‘sole source databases’ such as football
ﬁxture lists or TV listings.

greater interest attaching to the ECJ’s ongoing and con-
sistent promotion of a test for originality focussed on
the concept of creativity. This has potential to lead to a
re-shaping of the traditional common law approach to
the question of originality, an argument that was made
in Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd v Meltwater Holding
BV and others.53 At ﬁrst instance, Proudman J applied
Infopaq in holding that certain newspaper headlines
were independent literary works, and that text extracts
from newspaper articles reproduced by the defendants
amounted to a reproduction of a copyright work,
because they expressed the author’s intellectual cre-
ation. The defendants argued that Infopaq had over-
ruled or at least ‘overtaken’ the test in Ladbroke v
William Hill by introducing the concept of creativity—
it was not merely a different means of expressing the
test of skill,
judgement and labour but required a
higher degree of originality. Proudman J suggested that
the test of quality had been ‘re-stated but for present
purposes not signiﬁcantly altered by Infopaq’,54 albeit
she acknowledged that the decision sat awkwardly with
certain provisions of English law and that its full impli-
cations had not yet been worked out.

The Court of Appeal upheld Proudman J’s ﬁndings.
In relation to subsistence of copyright in headlines, the
Chancellor, giving the judgment of the court, held that
in Infopaq, the ECJ had clearly related the question of
‘intellectual creation’ to the question of origin and not
to novelty or merit. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal
held,
Infopaq did not qualify the long standing
common law test that the work had to be original in

the sense of originating from the author.55 Meltwater
has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will
hear the case next year. However, the authors under-
stood that the appeal does not cover the test for ‘ori-
ginality’ but focuses on the temporary copies exception
to infringement.

Of course, in many cases, both the skill and labour
test and the ‘author’s own intellectual creation’ test, to
the extent that they are in any event different, will
produce the same result. An example is Temple Island
Collections Ltd v New England Teas Ltd,56 where Judge
Birss QC held that copyright subsisted in a black and
white photograph of a red bus travelling across West-
minster Bridge. The judge held that the work was ori-
ginal as it was the result of the photographer’s own
intellectual creation both in terms of his choices relat-
ing to the photograph itself and also in terms of work
done after to manipulate the image. As the judge put
it: ‘These elements . . . derive from and are the expres-
sion of skill and labour exercised by Mr Fielder, or in
Infopaq terms, they are his intellectual creation.’57 This
approach by the judge bears an uncanny resemblance
to that taken by judges of the Patents Court in recent
years where, when assessing whether a claimed inven-
tion is obvious (ie lacks an inventive step), the court
has cross-checked the question by considering both the
traditional ‘historical’ approach of the English courts
and also the EPO’s ‘problem-solution’ analysis.58 To the
best of the authors’ knowledge, in no case where this
dual assessment has been undertaken has there been a
divergence of outcome.
