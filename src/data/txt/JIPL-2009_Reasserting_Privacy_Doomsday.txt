Re-asserting ‘privacy’ as a protectable interest:
Warren and Brandeis confront the
‘First-Amendment Doomsday Machine’
Robert M. Kunstadt and Ilaria Maggioni*

As recently as 1890, privacy rights were a novel legal
concept. In that year, Warren and Brandeis successfully
advocated for their protection.1 By the mid-twentieth
century, a cognizable privacy interest had entered the
mainstream of legal thought, setting a high-water mark
in Supreme Court precedent deregulating private sexual
conduct.2

Yet today privacy interests are challenged by seem-
ingly insurmountable practical obstacles, before which
the
law seems powerless. An Olympic medallist
indulges in banned substances at a campus party.
A ‘friend’ carrying a cellphone, snaps a photo. The
photo ﬁnds its way to the tabloids and proliferates on
the internet. Sober persons shake their heads:
‘he
should have known better’. You have to expect such
things nowadays, with a camera on every corner.3

Legal efforts at vindicating privacy interests of all
types seem hopelessly outclassed by the ultimate ‘First-
Amendment Doomsday Machine’, commonly known as
the internet. Whether the speciﬁc harm is unauthorized
publication of photos, personal or commercial dispar-
agement, or copyright infringement of music and ﬁlms,
the task of protecting legal interests in keeping infor-
mation private (limiting its circulation to authorized
persons), increasingly seems futile. As advocates of the
unregulated internet put it, ‘information wants to be
free’.4

nyms (‘handles’) and employ easily obtainable online
software to cloak their identities.7

What, exactly,

is meant by the ‘First-Amendment
Doomsday Machine’? In one sense, a general sense, it is
the internet itself. In a manifestation, it is an increas-
ingly popular
‘business plan’ generically to proﬁt
online from the otherwise restricted emanations of
others, variously taking cover under the CDA and
invoking the mantle of the First Amendment and ‘con-
sumer protection’.

Considering the ﬁrst general sense, why is the internet
like a ‘Doomsday Machine’? In the ﬁlm Dr Strangelove,
the Doomsday Machine was devised by the Soviet Union
to counter the US nuclear arsenal.8 The Doomsday
Machine’s operative principle was that the USA should
not think that by launching a ﬁrst strike on ‘command
and control’
the Soviet Union’s ability to
retaliate would be crippled so that the USA could ‘win’
a pre-emptive nuclear war. The Doomsday Machine,

remote foreign country, in a quotation by a blogger, or
the like), beyond control of the aggrieved individual; or
even of the original poster, who despite a change of
mind may be effectively powerless to implement a fully
effective retraction.

In a recent public speech, US President Barack
Obama warned about the enduring damaging effects
on privacy rights from internet postings on social sites
like Facebook:

Well, let me give you some very practical tips. (Laughter.)
First of all, I want everybody here to be careful about what
you post on Facebook – (laughter) – because in the
YouTube age, whatever you do, it will be pulled up again
later somewhere in your life. And when you’re young, you
make mistakes and you do some stupid stuff. And I’ve
been hearing a lot about young people who – you know,
they’re posting stuff on Facebook, and then suddenly they
go apply for a job and somebody has done a search and –
so that’s some practical political advice for you right there.
(Laughter.) That’s number one.11

The internet, like the Doomsday Machine, is an
automaton that for all intents and purposes
appears to be beyond individual human control

without human intervention and beyond human
control or even the power of cancellation, would auto-
matically retaliate against any such ﬁrst strike, destroy-
ing the USA (and indeed the entire world).9 The
internet, like the Doomsday machine, is an automaton
that for all intents and purposes appears to be beyond
individual human control. An operative principle
endorsed heartily by advocates of an unregulated inter-
net is that ‘the remedy for speech is more speech’.10 As
in the ﬁctional plot of Dr Strangelove, the ‘remedy’ for
a strike is a retaliatory strike. If someone posts inaccur-
ate information about a business,
for example, the
business is free to post a refutation in its own words;
but the original posting will (at minimum) remain
somewhere on the internet (on a mirror site in a

Machine into operation a few days before telling the USA about it;
leading to a sardonic plot premise unfolding inescapably into world
destruction at the hands of a few US ‘cowboys’ (in both good and bad
senses of that term: the oddball maverick and the resourceful ﬁghter-to-

The internet is like the Doomsday Machine because
both imply ﬁnality. Once posted on the internet, infor-
mation quickly circulates to all corners of the globe,
mirrored on multiple third-party servers for efﬁcient
distribution. Global search engines such as Google and
Yahoo!,
the
‘Wayback Machine’ (www.InternetArchive.org) ensure
that such ‘information’ (good or bad) can be accessed
by anyone in the world at any time, well
into the
indeﬁnite future. In this sense, the internet is unlike
an old-fashioned newspaper, which might have
remained available for a long time in a dusty library
archive; but could hardly have been found instantly
and effortlessly by anyone, anywhere in the world, at
any time. Hence, the potential for injury to privacy
interests, broadly understood in the sense used here
(the
circulation to authorized
persons), becomes effectively unbounded by limits of
time or space.12

removal’ policies in an effort to leverage the CDA and

there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to
avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is
more speech, not enforced silence. Only an emergency can justify
repression. Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with
freedom.’).

their jurisdictional motions to dismiss: the alleged offence did not take

the First Amendment to assure ﬁnality of their users’
critical postings. As explained on one such ‘consumer
protection’ website:

. . . we never remove reports even when they are claimed
to contain defamatory statements, and even if the original
author requests it.

The reasons for this policy are simple.

First, this site is only effective when all complaints are
maintained and preserved so that over time patterns of
truly bad business practices are exposed. If we removed
complaints this would give companies an incentive to
pressure authors (or us) to remove true and accurate
reports in exchange for money or simply to avoid a costly
lawsuit. For that reason, we will never agree to remove
reports, even if someone can show that a report is prob-
ably inaccurate. Under this policy, no reports are ever
removed, so there is no beneﬁt to companies who threaten
or pressure a customer hoping to get them to retract a
valid complaint. Even if this means that one or more ques-
tionable reports are left up, we think that removal of any
reports would ultimately make this site less credible and
thus less effective as a tool for educating consumers. That’s
why we have made this strict policy decision. http://www.
ripoffreport.com/wantToSueRipoffReport.asp

This approach might be characterized, in short, as the
‘Dog Run’ manifestation of the Internet Doomsday
Machine: you visit the website, leave your postings, and
no one ever cleans them up.

While the USA effectively holds sovereignty over a
chokepoint of the internet, since the master

While the USA effectively holds sovereignty over a cho-
kepoint of the internet, since the master domain name
servers are located in Virginia at
the premises of
Network Solutions, to date it has followed a laissez-
faire policy. Inaction promotes the notion of an all-
powerful, super-national internet that is impossible to
regulate. In the name of freedom under US sponsor-
ship, users come to accept a view of the internet as
today’s equivalent of the Roman Empire’s Coliseum,
where any kind of spectacle, no matter how debased,
violent, injurious, or unfair, is viewable without effec-
tive limit.

Warren and Brandeis were well ahead of their time
in envisioning the harm that could result from such
invasions of ‘privacy’ in its broadest sense (which was
precisely the sense in which they understood the
term):

Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have
invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life;
and numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good
the prediction that ‘what is whispered in the closet shall be
proclaimed from the house-tops.’ . . . Gossip is no longer
the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become
a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effron-
tery. To satisfy a prurient
taste the details of sexual
relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily
papers.

Importantly, Warren and Brandeis expressly derived
their argument for legal protection of the then newly
needed ‘privacy’ right, by logical extension from the
then already-established rights of protection against
intellectual property infringement; breach of contract
and implied trust; and slander and libel. They found
that all such legal rights stem from a common source
in the right ‘to be let alone’, ie the right to an ‘inviolate
personality’:

the enforcement of

. . . the legal doctrines relating to infractions of what is
ordinarily termed the common-law right to intellectual
and artistic property are, it is believed, but instances and
applications of a general right to privacy, which properly
understood afford a remedy for the evils under consider-
ation. . . . These considerations lead to the conclusion that
the protection afforded to thoughts, sentiments, and
emotions, expressed through the medium of writing or of
the arts, so far as it consists in preventing publication, is
merely an instance of
the more
general right of the individual to be let alone. It is like
the right not be assaulted or beaten, the right not be
imprisoned, the right not to be maliciously prosecuted,
the right not to be defamed. In each of these rights, as
indeed in all other rights recognized by the law, there
inheres the quality of being owned or possessed – and
(as that is the distinguishing attribute of property) there
may some propriety in speaking of those rights as prop-
erty. But, obviously, they bear little resemblance to what
is ordinarily comprehended under that term. The prin-
ciple which protects personal writings and all other per-
sonal productions, not
and physical
appropriation, but against publication in any form, is in
reality not the principle of private property, but that of
an inviolate personality.

rights such as copyright.13 But today it seems that even
those previously established rights need a legal boost,
suffering an online trampling in the rush to share
copyrighted music and videos on MySpace, YouTube,
and the like.14

For example, Google scans books

from public
libraries, posting them online at
its ‘Google Book
Project’ website without regard to copyright status.15
Yet some commentators ﬁnd this laudable:

Personally, I don’t have a huge amount of sympathy for
those who complain about the ‘unfairness’ to copyright
holders in Google’s plans [see Robert Kunstadt’s rather
intemperate remarks in the National Law Journal here].

‘Google took from the authors ﬁrst—and belatedly now
seeks to legitimize its misconduct by this settlement.
Instead, Google should be punished hard, to deter such
schemes. Otherwise, Google will succeed where Napster
failed. Respect for IP law—as well as the rule of law in
general—will decline. If an enterprising homeless person
pitches a tent in Google’s corporate parking lot for a
‘Thomas Jefferson Used Book & CD Flea Market,’ will
Google let it stay there (since it only occupies part of the
lot)? How about for a proﬁt percentage as sweetener to
induce ‘settlement’?

Google’s conduct ﬁts the deﬁnition of a public nui-
sance, and may be enjoined as such. It imposes a small
harm on a large number of authors. The harm, copying
only a portion of each work, is calculated so as not to
make it worthwhile for an author to incur the expense of
suing for injunctive relief. Google, despite its cute slogan
‘Don’t be evil,’ is like a large paper mill releasing noxious
gas over a wide area, sufﬁciently diluted that you smell it
but faintly. Like those banks that are now ‘too big to fail,’
is Google really ‘too big to infringe’?’

That is pernicious nonsense. The Google Books project
has the potential to become one of the great information-
gathering activities in human history—every book (just
about), at everyone’s ﬁngertips, searchable and instantly
accessible from any corner of the globe. And we want to
deter that?? Because that will decrease ‘respect for IP laws’?
Talk about putting the cart before the horse!! Because it

son stressed so long ago, is a ‘social right’ – given by
society because we feel it serves useful ends (incentivizing

13 The modern law of copyright, for example, is generally considered to

originate in the UK with the 1709 statute of Queen Anne, two centuries
before Warren and Brandeis ﬁrst advocated a privacy right.

14 M Peers, ‘Media Risk Walking The Plank’, The Wall Street Journal, March
6, 2009 (p. 10) (‘ . . . buccaneering sites like Parrot Bay offer a huge array
of television and movie content for free’); but see L Nordstrom,
Hollywood Scores Win Over Pirate Bay, 4 Convicted (Associated Press,
17 April 2009) (one-year prison sentences for the ‘Pirates’ of Pirate Bay).
But the problem still cannot be considered solved: Director Steven
Soderbergh testiﬁed before Congress that his movie ‘Che’ was ‘killed’ by
piracy in South America because it had opened earlier in Spain.

authors to produce new creative works). When it ceases to
serve those ends,
it should be eliminated. The Google
Books project is another example of how copyright inter-
ests, these days, do little more than obstruct useful inno-
vations. There are 7 million (or more) out of print books
that Google would like to place on-line where they can
actually be accessed and read. I’m sorry if that infringes
someone’s copyright, but really – in what way is society
better off, exactly, from recognizing the copyright holder’s
rights in this circumstance?16

As Warren and Brandeis’ logic implies, the privacy-
destroying effects of the internet (‘First-Amendment
Doomsday Machine’ that it is) apply to all forms of
their generalized ‘privacy’ right. This is precisely dedu-
cible from the postulates of Warren and Brandeis
quoted above: ‘privacy’ emanates from an underlying
generalized right, as a sibling in a family of other such
rights, all basing themselves on the inviolate right
of personality. By seizing upon personal emanations
of any kind, be they photos, writings, information or

facts, or literary, artistic or musical creations, and
ﬁnally and irreversibly disseminating them worldwide,
the Internet Doomsday Machine possesses the power to
harm the entire family of such rights.

That real property is somehow naturally superior or
logically prior to IP is a fallacy. Without legal interven-
tion to prevent trespass, there would be no property of
any kind—real, personal, or intellectual. If you could
not conceal it in your pocket, you would not invest in
it (and maybe not even then). For example, Native
American tribes provided no legal protection for real
property (land was open to all), but they enforced a
kind of trade mark/copyright to protect the familial
exclusivity of the designs painted on their teepees.17

ﬁed above, at the same time support strong internet

privacy rights. For example, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (‘EFF’) propounds on its website:

New technologies are radically advancing our freedoms,
but
they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of
privacy.

Your cell phone helps you keep in touch with friends
and families, but it also makes it easier for the feds to
track your location.18

Your Web searches about sensitive medical information
might seem secret, known only to you and search engines
like Google. But by logging your online activities, these
companies are creating a honeypot of personal
infor-
mation, potentially available to any party wielding a sub-
poena.

And the next time you try to board a plane, watch
out—you might be turned away after being mistakenly
placed on a government watch list based on erroneous
data.

Technology isn’t the real problem, though; rather, the
law has yet to catch up to our evolving expectations of and
need for privacy. In fact, new government initiatives and
laws have severely undermined our rights in recent years.

Privacy rights are enshrined in our Constitution for a
reason—a thriving democracy requires respect for individ-
uals’ autonomy as well as anonymous speech and associ-
ation. These rights must be balanced against legitimate
concerns like law enforcement, but checks must be put in
place to prevent abuse of government powers.

EFF ﬁghts in the courts and Congress to extend your
privacy rights into the digital world, and supports the
development of privacy-protecting
technologies. http
://www.eff.org/issues/privacy

By denigrating the enforcement of IP rights online,
EFF undercuts its own goal of protecting privacy rights
online. EFF does not seem to be aware that, until
Warren and Brandeis developed their argument for
privacy protection, no such right was considered to be
part of the Constitution. It does not seem to realize
that IP rights are part of the original justiﬁcation for
having recognized privacy rights in the ﬁrst place, not
to mention that any decline in respect for law will
undercut the force of all
laws—including the law of
privacy rights. It is as if EFF saws off the very limb on
which it builds its own treehouse.

Given the challenging environment presented by the
Internet Doomsday Machine,
is there hope for the
Warren-Brandeis concept of privacy protection in a
broad sense?

suggestions

for a resourceful
counter-attack against the Doomsday Machine, based
upon our practical experience in such cases. Since the
basis of immunity under the CDA is non-involvement
of the ISP in the production of the postings in issue,
the ISP should have no principled basis to object to
their modiﬁcation or even removal. For example,
while the poster is typing the posting, the ISP does
not object
the poster backspaces and deletes a
word, sentence or even a whole paragraph or page.
Hence, upon the same principle, subsequent removal
of all or part of a posting by its original author,
should be of no consequence to the ISP. As it is said,
‘easy come, easy go’.

From that proposition,

it is only a small step to
conclude that in cases where the author cannot be
found due to being anonymous, the courts may act in
the author’s place to make corrections that by right
should have been made in the ﬁrst place. Given the current

state of technology, such corrections can if necessary
be made without involvement of the ISP, by direct
court
intervention through the ofﬁces of qualiﬁed
experts in electronic forensics (ie ‘white hat’ hackers).
Despite any professed policy of non-removal of post-
ings pursuant to the ‘Dog Run’ plan, the ISP should
not even be deemed to have standing to intervene
and object, consistent with the statutory ISP-immu-
nity principle (based as it is, upon non-involvement
by the ISP).

Importantly, actions

that would constitute illegal
hacking, if performed as self-help by the offended plain-
tiff, are appropriate if performed pursuant to court order
and supervision.19 To denigrate this approach as no
more than a suggestion to ‘just’ remove the offending
posting, as per the NIKE slogan, is erroneously to over-
look the crucial factor of court supervision. For example,
the copyright statute expressly authorizes the courts to

user started a website ‘People Who Sit In The Disability Seats When I’m
Standing On My Crutches’, to display their photos online for public
shaming. J Moody, ‘The iPhone Vigilante’, NY Times, 5 April 2009 (p.
CY1). Some of those depicted, riposted that they have disabilities that are
not perceptible. Given this example, it is easy to imagine still worse

applications of this potent technological-device combination that would
have Warren and Brandeis spinning in their graves.

supporting a temporary restraining order or a prelimi-
nary injunction pending trial.21

Thus an ISP’s immunity claim under the CDA should
have no bearing upon a ﬁnal court order after trial
decreeing the removal by a forensic expert of a copy-
righted song or a trade marked logo from a webpage.
This result is no different in principle from the com-
monly publicized result of a steamroller crushing coun-
terfeit watches.22 Where the defendant cannot be found,
the infringement action and this remedy may be carried
out in rem against the offending postings themselves.23

Especially in the case of sound recordings,

this
in rem approach would have been preferable to the RIAA’s
former campaign to sue individual infringers for mon-
etary damages. Accused infringers found it all too easy
to claim that
the recordings were made by minor
children, or by someone else using the defendant’s
computer. The sums demanded by RIAA, while author-
ized by statute, seemed harsh when applied to teen-
agers,
Such
sympathetic defendants attracted support from self-
appointed public advocates who defended them zeal-
ously without charge. As a result, the recording indus-
try’s image suffered in the public eye.

and

Had the RIAA instead pursued a plan of court-
ordered automated removal of
infringing recordings
in rem, the practice would have been stopped in its
tracks, both as a technical matter and for sound practical
reasons. No one would have voluntarily come forward
to claim ‘ownership’ of such unauthorized recordings,
or been able to justify maintaining them online even if
they wished to admit ownership. This supposition is
consistent with and indeed supported by the defence
commonly asserted by the accused, that ‘they were not
the ones who did it’. The infringing recordings would
have simply disappeared into the Recycle Bin, erased by
the same modern computerized technology that per-
mitted them to be disseminated effectively in the ﬁrst
place, at
low cost, and without substantial human

25 For example, the authors obtained a preliminary and permanent

injunction and a US$10M ﬁnal judgment in St. Kitts in favour of a US
plaintiff, against a website owned by a defendant company organized
under St. Kitts law but operating in the US market.

26 Money damages can be substantial. Woody Allen recently sued for

US$10M due to unauthorized use of his photo (taken from a movie still)
on a billboard. The case settled just before trial for US$5M, paid by the
defendant’s insurer. Allen opined: ‘ . . . $5 million is enough to discourage

intervention, by the Doomsday Machine. After all, if an
infringing recording cannot be found by the court-
authorized monitor, it cannot be found by would-be
downloaders either.

When seeking a remedy against abusive online activities,
there might be leverage in pursuing the offending website’s
third-party providers, like the hosting ISP and the payment
processor (eg providers of online payment solutions,
which handle the ﬂow of money from the offending
website for remittance to the defendant’s bank accounts).
The wording of the injunction should be crafted to run
broadly against any persons acting in privity, concert, or
participation with the enjoined party. That would form the
basis for demanding that the ISP follow the injunction as a
person in privity, concert, or participation with the oper-
ator of the offending website. The same wording may be
useful to reach payment processors used by the offending
website, as a vehicle to ‘follow the money’ and secure satis-
faction of the future judgment, or freeze funds while in
transit before remittance to the website owner. Tracing the
money trail is crucial. A properly worded injunction would
support a subpoena of payment records to locate bank
accounts, even abroad.

In many cases, offending internet posters have non-
US contacts that can form basis for suit against them
in a non-US jurisdiction. This can be a distinct plus,
since foreign law is often more favourable to the plain-
tiff than US law.24 There likely will be no analogue to
the First Amendment or the CDA.25 Obtaining a ﬁnal
foreign monetary judgment,26 as distinguished from a
mere preliminary injunction, is a clear advantage for
US domestication of a foreign judgment.27

Complaints brought in foreign courts should adhere
to the most rigorous US standards in establishing
documentary proof of damages and a causation nexus
with the defendants’
tortious conduct. To facilitate
enforcement in the USA and regardless of whether it is
required in the foreign jurisdiction, plaintiff ’s counsel
should procure supporting afﬁdavits of competent

. . . anyone else from ever trying such a thing again’. ‘Weekly News –
Woody Takes $5M in Publicity Suit’, 19 May 2009, www.ManagingIP.com.
Time will tell if Woody is correct; it seems unlikely. The defendant may
be celebrating the free publicity obtained courtesy of its insurer (the best
money ever spent on insurance). Just paying Woody in the ﬁrst place
might not have been nearly as effective.

27 US precedent provides that a foreign money judgment is entitled to

recognition, based on its origination from reputable accredited
jurisdictions; eg the highest state court in New York held that ‘ . . .
considering that our own jurisprudence is based on England’s, a
defendant sued on an English judgment will rarely be in a position to
defeat it . . . . Any suggestion that England’s system of courts does not
provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the
requirements of due process borders on the risible’. CIBC Mellon Trust
Co. v Mora Hotel Corp N.V., 100 N.Y.2d 215, 222 (CANY 2003).

Another advantage experienced in some foreign juris-
diction is the local courts’ higher legal standards for
litigation conduct. For example, British courts and British-
trained judges may be rather less tolerant than some US
courts of contemptuous behaviour on the part of liti-
gants. A party in contempt of court for not removing an
offending online posting when ordered will be effectively
denied further access to the court’s justice.

No pleadings may be allowed on any ground and for
any kind of relief (including appeal) until the party has
purged itself of the contempt by complying verbatim
with the violated orders. Long before the test of
whether a foreign injunction against speech could be
enforced in the USA, the ISP would have to remove the
offensive posting to purge itself of contempt. That is
exactly the desired result.

An ISP might seek to avoid foreign jurisdiction by

means such as this online disclaimer:

NOTICE FOR USERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES:

The Ripoff Report website is intended solely for use
inside the United States. This site should not be used to
post information regarding foreign (non-US-based) com-
panies unless the report involves a transaction which took
place inside the United States. This site complies with all
applicable United States laws including, but not limited to,
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 USC. 512.
Different countries have very different
laws regarding,
among other things,
free speech
rights and what may or may not constitute defamation.
Because Rip-off Report cannot and does not investigate
the accuracy of statements on this site, use of the site to
publish and/or review reports is limited to only United
States residents regarding United States companies. Any
other use of the site is expressly prohibited. http://www.

intellectual property,

While this disclaimer may prudentially discourage post-
ings from outside the USA, it may be doubted that it
would be given exculpatory effect outside the USA, in a
case where a foreign plaintiff convinced its local courts
that it had a legitimate grievance against the website.
Indeed, this disclaimer may itself evidence the website
owner’s awareness of the risks attached to its activities

and of the need for it to police its site to prevent harm
to foreigners; and further provide a rationale for coerced
removal of an offending posting about a foreigner as
being against the website’s own published policy.

In case of non-compliance with a foreign judgment,
after obtaining foreign contempt orders it might be poss-
ible to petition for additional remedies, eg the appoint-
ment of a local trustee to take over and administer the
offending domain names and the website, disable them
to stop the violation, and/or sell them at auction to
satisfy the judgment. The plaintiff would probably have
the option to buy such properties at the auction, and
subsequently shut down the offending website’s oper-
ations and remove the offending postings permanently.
Also, post-judgment petitions to the court abroad could
include some of the remedies advocated above (court-
ordered appointment of a special master with the techno-
logical knowledge to legally ‘hack’ the website and disable
the infringing postings; court-ordered self-help, etc.),
achieving a practical result without even the need for
invoking US enforcement procedures.

A ‘Dog Run’ policy of non-removal (as discussed
earlier) effectively means that the poster could be con-
sidered a legal servant of the ISP. In effect, the ISP has
provided hosting space in return for the poster’s generat-
ing the content, and providing the ISP with a perpetual
non-exclusive copyright licence. This beneﬁts the ISP
commercially because it builds up the content of the
ISP’s website. This purportedly puts the content out of
the control of the poster, but at the same time it puts the
poster and the ISP into a contractual privity and thereby
logically implicates the ISP as the ultimate content provi-
der. Due to the underlying and controlling perpetual
licence transaction, the ISP has effectively become a ‘pur-
chaser’ of the content. The Associated Press may as well
try to disclaim responsibility for invasions of privacy
committed by its
freelance ‘stringer’ photographers
(whose photos it acquires by licence or assignment).

Businesses and individuals who are liable to
become victims of privacy invasions, broadly
understood, should take proactive measures to
increase their prospects for relief

Finally, businesses and individuals who are liable to
become victims of privacy invasions, broadly under-
stood, should take proactive measures to increase their
prospects for relief. There is no recording permitted at
most concerts, by contract. There is no ﬂash photogra-
phy permitted at most art museums, by contract.

Microsoft’s GENUINE ADVANTAGE

program
requires software users to ‘call home’ to Microsoft to
activate their programs before use, required by con-
tract. If the user does not, the software is crippled. It
would be a small step for Microsoft to require, as part
of the same transaction, that users pre-authorize the
remote deletion from the hard drive of software that
was not timely ‘activated’.

Similarly, pre-authorized removal of online postings
about Microsoft could be arranged by contract. Even if
that were considered objectionable in the case of
Microsoft, due to its market power in the ofﬁce soft-
ware and operating system market giving rise to an
unenforceable contract of adhesion,
that objection
would not apply in most other cases. A business having
substantial contacts with the public should consider to
take proactive steps to avert unfavourable customer
postings, by including a protective provision in con-
tracts with its customers:

Business X does not publicize its dealing with its custo-
mers without the customers’ prior written consent. Simi-
larly, the customer may not publish statements (favorable
or unfavorable) concerning Business X or its goods or ser-
vices, or utilizing the name or picture of Business X, its
premises, or its staff (including without limitation adver-
tising, publicity, and/or online postings) without the prior
written consent of Business X. Customer agrees to assign
and hereby does assign to Business X the copyright and
moral rights in such statements. Customer waives any
ﬁrst-amendment theory and stipulates that for protection
of Business X’s valuable goodwill established over many
years, and due to the likelihood of irreparable injury not
readily compensable in damages, any such unauthorized
publication shall be preliminarily enjoined on ex parte

motion of Business X without bond in any court having
jurisdiction (without prejudice to other remedies, includ-
ing without limitation damages, an accounting and perma-
nent injunctive relief).

This contractual provision frames the issue squarely.
Unless the courts are willing to write ‘freedom of con-
tract’ out of the legal lexicon, non-monopoly providers
of goods and services ought to be able to enforce their
privacy right to operate a digniﬁed business free of
‘tabloid-style’ publicity
‘ﬂame wars’
impugning their integrity. Any complaint can be ade-
quately addressed by the civil courts and applicable
professional and administrative licensing authorities.28

and online

Formidable challenge
The challenge posed by the internet in its manifestation
as the ‘First-Amendment Doomsday Machine’ is for-
midable. However, what we are experiencing today is
not substantially different from what Warren and Bran-
deis already foresaw in 1890. They spoke of ‘mechanical
devices’; we have the internet. But potential privacy
victims were not abandoned as beyond all hope of
relief then, and they need not be now. As Warren and
Brandeis predicted, the common law is resourceful.
Especially if suitable protective measures are employed
in advance, those seeking to utilize the internet to
violate privacy rights can be dealt setbacks substantial
enough to make their business plans impractical.
