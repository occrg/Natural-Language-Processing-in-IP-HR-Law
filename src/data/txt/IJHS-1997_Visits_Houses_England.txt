Including  an  estimate  of  a  further  100  million  annual  visits  to  other  fee-
charging  heritage  enterprises, historic houses  represent  one of the major  market
segments  of heritage  tourism. Alone, they  account  for about  20% of the current
domestic heritage visitor  market  with  the top nine properties regularly  attracting
over  half  a  million  visitors  each.9  It  has been  estimated  that  this  market  share
was  worth  approximately  f 100  million  in  the  1993 season,10 or  about  half of
one per cent of the total value of tourism to the UK economy.11

Although  presented  and  marketed  largely  as  an  homogeneous  product  the
historic  house  market  is  more  genuinely  characterised  by  a  high  degree  of
differentiation,  characterised by an heterogeneous set of products with an equally
heterogeneous set of meanings.12 While the profile of the market is dominated by
the  well  known  larger  attractions,  and  by  the  large  operators  such  as  the
National  Trust  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  English  Heritage,  the  typical  visitor
enterprise  is  a  small,  often  owner-operated,  business.13  Indeed,  over  three-
quarters of historic properties attract  less than  50,000 visitors per annum, giving
them incomes insufficient  to warrant  full-time  professional  management.14

Pure  commercialism  is not, however,  the principal  driving  force  behind  most
of  these  businesses  as  many  of  them  have  been  opened  to  the  public  as  a
condition of exemption  from  Inheritance Tax, while others have been  adapted as
visitor  enterprises  through  a lack of alternative  uses.15 Furthermore  the  majority
of properties  are not owned by the private sector, but by a multiplicity of public,
voluntary  and charitable.agencies,16 each  with  their  own source of finance  and
consequent  approach to profitability.

This  dual  plurality  of  both  provision  and  motivation  has  led,  suggests
Robinson,  to  an  industrial  structure  in  which  commercial  success  remains
compromised by a history of non-commercial  provision.

The fundamental  characteristics of visitor attractions as a whole show why
commercial success can be difficult  to achieve. Assets are often not properly
valued in the accounts of the business. Many are subsidised by local authorities,
sponsorship or organisations such as English Heritage and the National Trust
where visitor income meets no more than a fraction  of total operating cost. It is
easy to see why fully  commercial investment cannot easily attain adequate levels
of return in an industry where these conditions are the norm. 17

The position is further  complicated by the composite nature of the product being
purchased  in  a  visit  to  an  historic  property.  The product  itself  amounts  to an
experience  in  which  the  consumer  is an  integral  part  of the production  process.
Accordingly, the experience cannot be tested or sampled in advance, so competition
is  inevitably  broad,  while  success  is  related  directly  to  the  perceived  ability of
individual attractions to provide value-for-money  recreational experiences.18

Furthermore the recreation experience itself is not unitary, but has five related
elements.19  These  are: planning  and  anticipation;  travel  to  the  attraction:  the
attraction  itself; the return  journey;  and recollection  of the visit.  There  is some
debate  over  the  relative  weight  of  these  elements  in  visitors'  perceptions  of
different  attractions. Not only do attraction  operators not control all the elements
of  the  experience,  but  many  visits  occur  as  part  of  a  wider  experience,  rather
than  as  the  principal  focus  of  the  day.20  As such,  external  factors  such  as a

96

pleasant  journey  or  traffic  congestion,  or  the  anticipation  thereof,  can  have  an
undue  influence  on  the  commercial  viability  of  individual  sites.

While  all  visitor  attractions  exhibit  some  level  of  market  differentiation,
theoretically  allowing  them  a  degree  of  market  power,21  the  reality  is  that  there
are  relatively  few 
'price  setters'  and  a  large  majority  of  'price  takers'.  As
Seabrooke  & Miles22  suggest,  the  price  setters  are  those  attractions  perceived  to
be  at  the  top  of  the  market  -  almost  all  being  in  the  private  sector  of  the
economy.  The  remainder, 
including  National  Trust  and  English  Heritage
properties,  are  generally  forced  to  take  the  prevailing  price  structure  and  set  their
prices  accordingly.

This  structure  does  not,  therefore,  allow  many  attractions  the  absolute
freedom  to  determine  their  individual  prices,  irrespective  of  the  market.  Yet,  as
Bovaird  et  al.  have  explained,  with  respect  to  properties  owned  by  the  National
to  English
Trust  and  the  Department  of  the  Environment  (now  transferred 
Heritage),23 
the  structure  of  the  market  does  allow  attractions 
to  exploit
customers  who  are  relatively  unaffected  by  increases  in  admission  charges.  This
is  due,  according  to  Johnson  & Thomas,24 to  the  incomes  of  visitors  being  more
significant  than  entry  price  in  determining  visitor  numbers,  leading  Prentice  to
comment  that  'heritage  tourism  is socially  selective'.25

A  low  price  elasticity  of  demand  is  usually  associated  with  the  purchase  of
essential  goods,  where  the  option  to  cease,  or  substantially  reduce,  consumption
following  a  price  increase  does  not  arise.  It  has,  however,  been  found  to  operate
with  respect  to  the  demand  for  visits  to  heritage  properties,  at  least  in  part
because  the  individual  cost  of admission  is low  compared  to  the  income  or  wealth
of  those  wishing  to  consume.  Following  Throsby  & Withers,26  it  has  also  been
argued  by  Johnson  & Thomas27  that  the  inelasticity  is  attributable  to  heritage
visits  being  an  acquired  skill not  easily  discarded  in  the  face  of price  rises.

Few  have  been  in  a  position  to  exploit  this  dimension  of  the  market,  which
should  provide  operators,  certainly  in  the  short  term,  with  the  ability  to  raise
income  through  increasing  admission  prices. Much  of this  failure  can  be  attributed
to  a  poor  appreciation  of  marketing  and  promotion.  If  heritage  sites  are  to  be
marketed  effectively,  an  understanding  of their  role  is  crucial.  A  widely  propagated
myth,  which  has  been  fuelled  by visitor  surveys, is that  people visit heritage  sites  to
learn,  yet  studies  also  show  that  visitors  do  not  appear  to  learn  very  much.28
Consequently  there  is little  real  understanding  of motivations  to  visit heritage  sites.
It  has  been  suggested  but  not  proven,  that  visits  to  galleries  and  museums  are
the  acquisition  of  new  knowledge.29
more  akin 
Similarly,  family  days  out  to  historic  houses  may  represent  a  quest  for  enjoyment
or  a  new  experience  rather  than  a  knowledge-gathering,  educational  exercise per
se. While  the  motivations  for  heritage  visiting  can  be  debated  at  length,  it  is  clear
that  this  particular  aspect  of  consumer  behaviour  is  poorly  understood,  with  a
considerable  gap  between  the  way  in  which  heritage  professionals  view  their
product  and  the  way  in  which  consumers  evaluate  it.  Schouten  states:

to  window-shopping 

than 

In most  cases the  assessment  by the public of the  heritage  attraction  is not  based
upon  the  scientific  correctness  of the core product  but  on  how  effective  the  site or
the exhibition  is in raising  curiosity,  appealing  to  fantasy,  and  in providing  a
challenge.30

Furthermore,  the marketing  of heritage has largely revolved  around  providing
information,  giving details  of site opening times, entrance  charges  and  such like.
It  has  been  less  effective  in  preparing  the  individual  for  the  actual  type  of
experience  they  can  expect.  So marketing  tends  to  convey  information  or  trivia
rather  than  knowledge. To some extent  this is the result  of complacency,  in  that
it is widely assumed that  people will continue to wish to visit heritage sites -  the
notion of the acquired skill -  thus leading to a lack of appreciation  of the need to
promote the  product.31

Much  of  the  responsibility  for  this  lack  of  appreciation  is  attributed  to  a
general failure  on  the  part  of operators  to develop strategic  planning  approaches
for  the  design  and  development  of  heritage  attractions.32  In  contrast  to  other
areas  of  the  leisure  industry  where  the  development  and  implementation  of
standards  and  good  practice  is becoming  routine,33  the  situation  with  respect  to
historic houses is quite  different:

For the practitioner, access to relevant quality information  about market trends,
management techniques and comparative operational data is fraught  with
difficulties.34

Rather  than  information  specific  to  historic  houses,  therefore,  operators
have  tended  to  rely  on  either  more  general  advice  and  guidance,  such  as
that  produced  by  the  Tourism  and  Environment  Task  Force  on  good
practice,35  or  on  individually  commissioned  (mostly  time-  and  location-
specific)  work,  such  as  that  produced  by  Anian  Leisure  for  the  Cornish
Association  of  Tourist  Attractions.36 
these
shortcomings  this  paper  presents  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  broad
workings  and  consequent  structure  of  the  supply  and  consumption  of  visits
to  historic  properties  in  England.

In 

Based  on  a  longitudinal  survey  of  a  sample  of  private  houses  open  to  the
public,  covering  the  seasons  from  1989  to  1996,37  the  paper  seeks  to  consider
both  the  magnitude  of,  and  trends  in,  the  managerial  benchmarks  discussed  by
Stevens  above.  In  so  doing,  the  paper  addresses  the  nature  of  the  market,
operators' response to the changes taking place in the market and,  consequently,
the emergent structure  of,  and trends in, the market.

Research Methodology
The  population from which  the  sample  was  originally  selected  was  defined  as  all
privately owned historic houses open to the public for more than two days 'per week
for a season lasting at least twelve weeks. Using records from  previous research the
population in  1989  was determined  to be just in excess of  1,000  properties. Given
that  no previous  statistical  analysis had  been undertaken,  no prior stratification  of
the population  was undertaken,  with  a five per cent sample of properties  (totalling
50) drawn from those previously expressing an interest in the work. To this extent
the sample was not random, but was structured to ensure co-operation  in the long
term, with those selected asked to continue to supply data annually as required.

This  method  of  sample  selection  has  proved  successful  for  this  project,  with
only  ten  of  the  original  sample  having  dropped  out,  after  seven  years  of  data
collection.  Notwithstanding  this  degree  of  consistency,  however,  it  remains  that

The  results  of  the  time  series,  therefore,  offer  an  insight  into  a  number  of
facets  of  the  historic  house  market  in  England.  In  particular,  they  offer  an
indication of how wider trends in UK domestic tourism have been reflected  in the
historic houses market, and what key variables characterise this market segment.
In  addition,  the  time  series  has  allowed  some  estimates  to  be  made  of  the
economic  dimensions  of  the  market,  particularly  in  terms  of  the  relationship
between  pricing  policies and  attendance  figures. These estimates  can, in turn, be
contrasted  with  the earlier work described above,39 so building a stronger  picture
of the nature  and wider attributes of the market for visits to historic houses.

The  key  indicators  used  in  the  survey  comprise:  attendance figures, divided
between  house,  grounds  and  associated  attractions  where  appropriate;  pricing
structure,  including  concessions,  season  tickets  and  other  promotions;  net
revenue 
(including
concessionaire  rentals  and  payments,  and  brochure  sales). No attempt  has  been
made to assess  or  aggregate  net  or  gross revenues  for  either  individual  ventures
or  for  the  market  as  a  whole.  Nor  has  any  attempt  been  made  to  infer  any
conclusions  about  the  profitability  of  either  the  individual  enterprises  or  the
industry as a whole.

Attendance
As Figure  1 indicates, the  general  trend  in visitor numbers since  1989  has been
an  upward  one,  with  predictions  for  1997  suggesting  that  this .is  going  to
continue.  However,  the  trend  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  1996  and  1997
figures,  with  the  previous  seven  years  indicating  more  of  a  bell-shaped
distribution,  peaking  in  1993.  Indeed,  prior  to  1995,  most  operators  were
expecting little change in the near  future,  with  attempts to avoid further  declines
in  visitor  numbers  being  the  most  common  strategy.40  The  more  optimistic
expectations  for  1997  must  therefore  be  seen  as  much  as  a  reaction  to  the
previous trends  as a reasoned  estimate of what  is likely to occur.

The Changing Market for Heritage Tourism

99

In  seeking  to determine  the key factors  underlying  the trends  in  admission
figures, those  for  houses  can be separated  from  gardens  for  a  number  of the
properties.  This  is shown  in Figure  2  where,  in the period  between  1989 and
1995, increases in grounds admissions apparently cushioned the decline in house
admissions. This trend was reversed in 1996

For the 1996 season there was a mean 9% increase in house admissions but a
mean  decrease of 4% in visitors to gardens, suggesting that the previous  growth

in  gardens visits may have reached  a plateau. While several properties  achieved
increases of over 25% in house admissions, only one recorded  a similar increase
in  gardens  admissions.  In  total  over  three-quarters  of the properties  surveyed
experienced  a  rise  in  house  visitors  while  over  half  experienced  a  decrease in
admissions to the gardens.

While the overall  trend  appears  relatively  uniform  and progressive,  however,
the  upswing  has been  geographically  variable,  with  properties  in  some  areas
experiencing a continuing decline in visitor numbers. This is very much the case
in  south-east  England,  where visitor  admissions  have  declined  consistently  since
1989.  This  decline  may well  be  linked  to  the  greater  alternative  day visitor
choices available in this area. However, it may also be part of a wider and more
structural shift in domestic tourism, in which the South East's share has declined
by  25% since  1979.41  In contrast,  properties in the Heart  of England,  the East
Midlands  and  the  West  Country  have  experienced  a  particular  growth  in
admissions  which  is generally  consistent  with  the structural  shifts  in  domestic
tourism noted in the British National Travel Survey.42

Admission  Prices
In  the  period  1989-1991,  at  the  time  of low economic  growth,  admission
prices  remained  fairly  static  in  real  terms,  following  a  similar  pattern  in the
Retail Prices Index (RPI). Similar overall increases in mean  admissions  charges
for  both  inclusive  and  grounds-only  adult  entry  were  experienced  between
1989  and 1996, with  rises of 76% (to £4.57) and 73% (to £2.94)  respectively,
but,  whereas  the  inclusive  adult  entry  price  has  increased  steadily,  the
grounds-only  entry  price  showed  a  decline  in  1991 (Table  1) followed  by a
sharp  recovery  in  1992  and  a  steady  increase  since  then.  Since  1992,
however,  admission  chargefor  both  categories  have  outpaced  inflation,  with
RPI  increasing  between  1989 and  1996 by  only  32%. The expectation  for

1997  is  that  both  categories  will  exhibit  further  rises  above  the  rate  of
inflation,  of around  7%.

Figure  3  indicates  that  admission  prices  for  grounds,  where  they  are  separate
from  house  admissions, have  risen  every year  since  1991. Despite the  decrease  in
visitor  numbers  last  season  admission  prices  currently  show  no  sign  of levelling,
and  are  continuing  to rise on  an  annual  basis  (11% in  1996).

Following  an  initial  surge  in  1993,  children's  entry  prices  have  increased
•steadily  every  year  since  they  were first recorded  in  1992  (Table  2),  rising  at  a
greater  rate  than  the  RPI. They  have increased  from  £2.01  in  1992  to a  current
level  of  £2.56,  showing  a  3%  rise  in  1996,  which  brings  them  into  line  with
rises  in  adult  prices  over  the  same  period  and  maintains  the  child's  price  at
approximately  56% of the  adult  entry  fee.

Senior  Citizen  concessionary  tickets  have  only  been  recorded  since  1994,  but
exhibit  some  similarities  in  their  emerging  price  structure  (Figure  4).  This  is
particularly  with  respect to maintaining  a  differential  between  this price  and  that
of  the  full  adult  entry  price,  at  approximately  10  per  cent.  In  two  years  they
have shown  a  15% increase,  from  £3.55  in  1994  to £4.10  in  1996.

Data  on the prices  of family  day tickets  and adult  and family  season  tickets
remain  sparse,  indicating  that  many  house  operators  have  not yet introduced
these concessions into their pricing schedules. Where figures  have been  given for
day  tickets  (by approximately  half  of the properties  surveyed)  they  range'from
twice  to three  times the adult  price,  with  a mean  price  for a  family  of four  at
£12.19, being approximately two-and-a-half  times that of the full  adult rate. This
represents  an overall  rise of just  3% since  they  were  first  recorded  in 1992. In
contrast family season tickets, with a mean of £32.90. have exhibited an increase
of  approximately  6% in the last  two years  and are now approximately  seven
times the adult  entry fee for the 1996 season.

The Relationship  Between  Admission  Numbers and Price
As the introduction  suggested,  the orthodox  view has been  that  the demand for
visits  to historic  houses  is not proportionally  affected  by increases  in  admission
price, even in conditions  such as the recent recession in the UK. Calculating the
elasticities  for  the  sample  of  houses  in  the  survey  does  not  contradict  this
orthodoxy,  although  the  trends  are  not  as  strong  as  those  found  in  other
research.43  As Table  3  indicates,  in  none  of the years  was an  elastic  demand
(values  less than  -1) experienced.  In contrast,  the demand  was inelastic  (values

between  0  and  -1)  in  the  years  1990,  1992,  1994  and  1995  indicating,  in  each
case,  that  rises  in  entry  charges  were  not  accompanied  by  proportional  falls  in
admissions  numbers.

While  these  findings  suggest  that  the  orthodoxy  of  price  elasticities  continues
to  hold,  some  caution  must  be  exercised  when  considering  these  data,  since  the
values  greater  than  zero  (0)  experienced  in  the  other  years  indicate  that  factors
other  than  price  also  contributed  to  changes  in  admission  numbers.  Although  the
study  did not  consider  income  elasticities,  it could  be that  these  are  at  least  partly
responsible  for  the  positive  values,  given  the  improving  fortunes  of  the  tourist
industry,  certainly  in  1996.44

Equally,  the  prices  set  for  house  admissions  for  the  1997  season  tend  to  suggest
that  operators  are  becoming  increasingly  cautious  about  their  continuing  ability  to
raise  admission  prices  without  reducing  net  revenue.  Thus  few  ventures  have
sought  substantial  increases  over  the  1996  figures,  despite  the  improving  fortunes
forecast  for  the  industry.45  The  extent  to  which  this  actually  represents  a  rational
strategy is, however,  questioned  by the  contmuingly  large price increases  associated
with  grounds  admissions,  indicating  that  the  overriding  philosophy  behind  these
pricing  strategies  appears  to  be  a  largely  subjective  assessment  of what  the  market
will  bear.46  There  is  very  little  evidence  of  any  systematic  market  testing,  with  the
differential  approach  to  house  and  gardens  undermining  any  apparent  recognition
of increasing  price  elasticities. This has  led Rogers  to  comment  that

Overall the  evidence seems to  suggest  that  the  sector is cautious  and  conservative
in  its approach  to pricing decisions although  there  is a  recognition  of the
importance  of price as a  facet  of the marketing  mix.47

Spend per head  on shops, catering  and  brochures
Other than  admission  charges, the most significant  commercial measures  are visitors'
spend  in  the  gift  shop,  on  brochures,  and  in  tea  rooms  and  other  retail  outlets.  In
historic terms, mean  total spend  per  head  has been rising consistently  since the  start
of  the  survey  period,  although  not  generally  at  the  rate  of  inflation  (represented  by
the  RPI in Figure  5). Indeed,  the mean  total spend per head  in  1996,  representing  a
non-inflation-adjusted  increase  of  11% over  1995,  was  the  first  occasion  in  which
the  overall spend  per head  had  risen  above  the  rate  of inflation  since  1989.

In  breaking  down  the  relative  financial  performance  of  shops,  brochure  sales
and  catering  (Table  4),  the  mean  spend  per  head  in  shops  currently  amounts  to

£1.12,  having  fallen  from  a  high  of  £1.21  in  1992.  This  represents  an  increase,
in  historic  terms,  of just  12p  in  the  period  1989-1996  which,  when  adjusted  for
inflation,  amounts  to  a  decline  of  some  20%  over  this  period.  Likewise,  the  per-
caplta income  from  brochure  sales  has  also  fallen  in  real  terms  between  1989  and
1996.  although  by  only  5%, to  a  current  mean  of  28p  per  head.

With  a  current  spend  of £1.51  per  head,  the  only  area  of net  financial  increase
has  been  in  catering  sales,  which  have  risen  12%  in  real  terms  since  1989.
However,  the  majority  of this increase  has  occurred  since  1994,  prior  to  which  the
mean  spend  per  head  had  fallen  some  14% behind  its  1989  figure  in  real,  inflation
adjusted,  terms.  In  overall  terms,  therefore,  the  mean  spend  per  head  in  1996,  of
just  under  £3,  does  not  represent  a  real  increase  over  the  1989  figure  of  £2.20,
once  inflation  is  taken  into  account,  although  predictions  for  the  outcome  of  the
1997  season  suggest  an  increase  of  5% or  twice  the  current  rate  of  inflation.

In  terms  of  benchmarks  for  commercial  performance  in  this  area  it  is  widely
accepted  that  all  enterprises  should  be  attempting  to  double  their  adult  admission
price  through  revenue  from  sales,  catering  and  brochures.48  Over  the  period  of  the
survey  this has  only been  achieved by one or  two of the  properties, and  not  in  every
year.  For  1996,  for  example,  revenue  per  head  amounted  to  approximately  60% of
adult  admission  prices,  with  just  one  property  achieving  a  100% increase,  and  only
half  achieving  more  than  50%. The lowest return  was  less than  10% of entry  price.

Market Research
While,  according  to  the  English Heritage  Monitor,*9 visits  to  historic  properties  have
risen  by  20% since  1975  and  by  28% since  1982,  there  is evidence  that  the  actual
number  of visitors has remained  about  the same.50 It can  be inferred  that  established
visitors are visiting more frequently,  but  that  new  audiences are not being  reached.51
In  the  face  of increasing  competition,  therefore,  those  who  prosper in  the  future  will
be  those  whose  management  is  most  able  to  adapt  to  the  changing  circumstances.
Apart  from  attention  to  financial  budgeting  and  control,  the  most  crucial  aspects of
the  business  to consider  are marketing  and  pricing. As Robinson  suggests:

At present,  marketing  expenditure  for  most  attractions  is still at  an  embryonic
level, relying  principally  on  the production  and  distribution  of colour  leaflets  and  a
relatively small  amount  of advertising in  local tourist guides and  publications.52

note  13, p.D-36.
53.  ibid.

In  place  of  this  minimalist  approach,  many  ventures  will  have  to  embark  on
detailed  market  research  and  analysis  to  ensure  the  effective  expenditure  of  an
increasingly  substantial  marketing  budget.  A  significant  element  of  this  revised
approach  will  involve  historic  house  operators  concentrating  more  fully  on
adapting  their  pricing  policies  to  their  chosen  target  markets.  Quite  apart  from
questioning  the  conventional  wisdom  of  most  ventures  being  price  takers,  it  is
clear  that  pricing  policy  itself  has  become  more  sophisticated  over  time.  There  is
growing  evidence  that  the  former  practice  automatically  discounting  entry  prices
for  some  groups  (such  as  children  and  older  people)  is  being  progressively
replaced  with  variable  pricing  by  time  of  day,  day  of week  or  by  season.  Equally,
the  sale  of  season  tickets,  'passports'  and  other  forms  of  membership  have
produced  significant  increases  of both  visitors  and  revenue  at  many  ventures.

Yet market  research  can be more of a  hindrance  than  a  help in that  surveys  tend
to  focus  on  quantitative rather  than  qualitative  data,  with  the  result  that  knowledge
of  the  reasons  for  visiting  historic  properties  remains  scant.  Also,  while  many
heritage  sites  charge  an  entry  fee,  there  are  a  vast  number  including  museums,
memorials,  landscapes  and  cathedrals,  which  are  free  of  entry  charge.  The  reasons
for  non-charging  are  varied  but  include  enhancing  access  for  educational  purposes
(such  sites  refer  to  themselves  as  'knowledge-based  institutions').  In  this  sense  the
need  to  understand  the  visitor  is  less  relevant  since  the  perceived  target  market  is
non-segmented  and  since competition  is less of an  issue.

It  is  becoming  apparent  that  many  heritage  sites  have  multiple  markets.  In
the  place  of  the  general  day-visitor  market  for  historic  houses,  a  more
differentiated  and  specialised  series  of  sub-markets 
is  emerging,  catering
increasingly  to  smaller  numbers  of  knowledgeable  enthusiasts.53  This  emphasis
on  special  interests  is  already  evident  at  some  properties  in  the  survey,  where
significant  declines  in  day  visitors  have  been  off-set  by  a  reorientation  towards
conferences,  filming,  concerts,  wedding  ceremonies  and  receptions,  fireworks
displays,  publicity  launches  and  other  non-day-visitor  enterprises.  Consequently
there  is  a  need,  when  engaging  in  marketing  activity,  to  differentiate  between
markets  for  events  and  markets  for  heritage  products.

It  has  also been  suggested  that  many  curators  and  enterprise  operators  are  too
insular,  with  the  result  that  they  are  unable  to  adopt  a  broader  perspective  or

appreciate  the bigger  picture  to  enable  effective  and pro-active  marketing  to
occur.54  As a  consequence,  communication  with  the visitor  at  many  heritage
attractions  can be limited.  This  occurs  in two ways: the experience  is usually
highly structured  and controlled,  with the result  that  the visitor invariably  plays
a  passive role; and communication  has traditionally  been  biased  towards words,
which  are a predominantly  flat  and limiting  medium.  As visitors  become  more
accustomed  to a  wide  variety  of media,  particularly  in  electronic  format,  it is
arguable  that  heritage  attractions  will lose out further  unless they  also embrace
new technology.

The role of information  technology in  presentation
Information  technology  (IT) is having  a  major  impact  in the presentation of
attractions.  Multi-media  (the  combination  of  sound,  text,  still  images  and
moving  pictures) is enabling  information  to be conveyed  both  aesthetically and
effectively.  Arguably  this  is of particular  relevance  to heritage  attractions  since
they  are,  by  nature,  unique.  They  thus  require  more  information  for
demonstration  and interpretive  purposes,  while also being  particularly  suited to
pictorial and audio, instead of wholly text-based, information.55  Examples of this
include  the  Holocaust  Memorial  Museum  in  Washington,  DC,  which  has
adopted  the Wexner  Learning  System  containing  video  clips  of scenes  in the
Second  World  War. Visitors  activate  the system  using  touch  screens  and can
listen  to newsreel  commentaries  with  the aid of stereo  headphones. In addition
to  35 hours  of video  footage,  the system  has 5500  photographs,  10 hours of
music,  760 maps  and 1500 text  articles. While the technology  in this  instance
must  enlarge the impact of the visitor experience, questions of an ethical  nature
are  undoubtedly  raised  about  the enhancement  and. indeed,  the existence of
such a memorial.

A second example is the Micro Gallery in the Sainsbury Wing of the National
Gallery,  London,  which  provides  visitors  with  an interactive  database  of images
and  text,  containing  2,200  paintings  and  1,000  illustrations,  as  well  as
animations.  It  enables  visitors  to study  a  variety  of art  approaches  by subject
matter,  period  and geography.  In  addition  the system  enables  users  to  select
paintings for their  personal tour which  can then be printed out in the form of a
floor plan to show the location of the paintings. Another example is the MOSAIC
project  (Museum of Scotland  Advanced  Interactive  Computer  System) which has
been developed by the National Museum of Scotland to present Scotland's history
and  culture  using  interactive  multi-media.  Visitors  will be introduced  to this in
the new Museum of Scotland building when it is opened in  1998.

All of these  examples  share  one thing in common:  they  are all adopting, or
have already adopted, technology which is interactive. This technology  transforms
the visitor experience from  a largely passive to an active role as well as providing
considerable flexibility in the manner in which information  is both  conveyed and
accessed. Consequently visitors are free to determine which information  is of more
interest to them and to access it accordingly. In this way heritage attractions have
the ability to adapt their product to consumers as individuals.

Furthermore,  changes  in  the  presentation  of  information  provide  an
opportunity  for marketers  to convey  information  about the visitor  experience in
advance of the visit, so instead of simply communicating  basic information  about
opening  times  and directions,  the focus  can shift  to information  which  is both

access technology, such as the Internet,  occur.

Conclusions
At one level, this study of heritage tourism in England has concerned a relatively
stable,  mature  market,  comprising  a  significant  proportion  of overseas  visitors
and  providing  a  strong  context  for  the  wider  imaging  of  the  UK as  an
international  tourist  destination.  Yet,  at  another  IeVel,  there  are  certainly
indications  that  the stability  may have  a time  limit,  while  maturity  may be no
defence to decline.

In part, this caution reflects  growing concerns  about the possible saturation of
the visitor  attraction  market in the UK.5f> Of wider, more international  relevance,
however,  is  the  extent  to  which  it  also  reflects  the  degree  to  which  the
presentation  and interpretation  of heritage  has failed  to adjust  to new demands
and  expectations. To this extent, it is redolent of similar  issues elsewhere, with a
divergence  becoming  increasingly  evident  between  the  supply  of  packaged
heritage and the increasing flexibility and interactivity  demanded  by day-visitors
and  tourists  alike.  Notwithstanding  the  increase  in  visitor  numbers  in 1996
which,  when  allied to increasing  prices and spend, led to a better  financial  year
for  many  historic  houses  in  England,  the  future  thus  remains  difficult  and
increasingly insecure.

In  addition  to these  issues,  there  is also  evidence  that  the long-standing
socio-economic  and age profile of visitors is beginning to change. While  there
are  few data  yet in the public  domain,  the trend  certainly  appears  to be that
the  age profile  is rising,  reflecting  not just  the general  aging  of society, but
also  the relative  decline in attendance  of younger  people. There  is also  some
evidence  that  the socio-economic  profile  of visitors  is rising,  reflecting  both
that  many  of the older  visitors  are relatively  well-off,  and that  many  of the
less  well-off,  from  the  lower  socio-economic  groups,  are  now visiting  less
than  previously.  In both  cases  this  restricts  the size  of the available  market
for  day visits.

However,  rather  than  the most  severe  competition  coming  from  within the
tourism  industry,  it  will  probably  emerge  from  the  technological  revolution
currently  taking place in home-based  entertainment.  Quite apart from  the virtual
reality  increasingly  available  in home  computer  games,  the expanding  range of
home-based  digital  information  and buying  services  will  encourage  people to
spend more time at home. This trend will be further  exacerbated if the findings of
the  recent  Royal  Commission  on the Environment  lead  to large increases  in the
cost of private  transport.

This  situation  has certainly  not been  improved  by the publication  of the

recent  government  report:  Tourism:  competing  with the best. With  its  outcome
being  a  redistribution  of funds  from  the English  Tourist  Board  to the British
Tourist  Authority,  the overriding  inference  of the report  is that  UK domestic
tourism,  other  than  for short  breaks, is in an inevitable  decline. While  agreeing
with  the  assertion  that  day-visits  may be  declining,  Middleton  suggests  that
operators  should be seeking new domestic markets,  particularly  those  associated
with  extra holidays:

The Changing Market for Heritage Tourism 

107

'The leaky bucket
syndrome: is there a
need to reassess policy
priorities?' Insights,  vol.
7,  1995, p.A-6.

... the  same people are  taking more  holidays in  any  year. This is the  source of
much  of the  growth  in  the  domestic market.  Far from  being  a  static pool in  which
holidays  are  taken  either in  the UK or  abroad,  this is a  growing  pool reflecting  the
increased  frequency  of holiday-taking,  based in  turn  on increased  disposable
income  and  attitude  shifts  57

In  overall  terms,  therefore,  the  future  for  historic  houses  and  heritage  tourism
more  generally,  is  mixed.  While  good  management,  creative  interpretation  and  a
concentration  on  relatively  exclusive  niche  markets  will  enable  many  operations
to  continue  to  prosper,  the  prospect  for  others  is  less  certain.  For  while  the
industry  itself  may  be  becoming  better  organised  and  managed,  external  factors
threaten  to  undermine  it.

As  a  result,  there  is  a  need  for  heritage  attractions  (and  historic  houses  in
particular)  to  become  more  marketing-orientated  than  they  have  been  in  the
past.  Information  technology  is  one  means  by  which  heritage  marketing  can
become  more  dynamic  from  the  perspectives  of  management,  presentation  and
distribution.  Yet  the  technology  itself  poses  potential  problems,  not  least  the
tendency  to  become  innovation  -  or  product-led,  instead  of consumer  driven.  The
question  whether  the  consumer  wants  IT as  part  of the  heritage  experience  needs
not  only  to  be  asked  but  answered.  Further,  IT  creates  the  opportunity  to
broaden  consumer  access  to  heritage  but  again  how  successful  this  proves  to  be
depends  on  the  consumer.  Ultimately  for  IT  to  benefit  heritage  marketing  in  a
positive  sense  it  must  serve  some  basic  functions  more  effectively 
than  is
currently  the  case,  which  in  turn  means  that  it  must  be  consumer  orientated.

In  conclusion,  the  forthcoming  period  does  not  look  to  be  an  easy  one  for  the
historic  house  market.  Day  trips  will  remain  a  significant  sector  in  the  UK
economy,  however,  and  the  challenge  for  house  owners  and  operators  will  be  to
ensure  that  they  continue  to  supply  quality  recreation  experiences  at  value-for-
money  prices  for  preselected  and  targeted  visitor  markets.
