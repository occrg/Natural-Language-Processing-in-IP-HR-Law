Indigenous Peoples: 
Issues of Deﬁnition

douglas e. sanders*

The progress that has been made by (cid:210)indigenous peoples(cid:211) in international forums has been aided by
the political perception that this category of claimants is limited and in some respects unique, and that
such claims can properly and safely be treated as a special case. Although the imprecision of the cate-
gory and the expanding array of groups involved in the (cid:210)indigenous peoples movement(cid:211) could even-
tually threaten this perception and provoke more sustained demands for precision, such a transfor-
mation has not yet occurred.1

1 introduction

For the last thirty years (cid:210)indigenous peoples(cid:211) have become more and more a focus
of international attention. This attention began with a focus on the Americas,
where the indigenous status of the Indian, Inuit, and Aleut peoples could not be
doubted.2 But Western commentators, nongovernmental organizations, and inter-
governmental bodies have applied the terminology far beyond the Americas. In re-
action, certain states, most notably China and India, have sought a de(cid:222)nition that
would make it clear that the populations they refer to as (cid:210)tribals(cid:211) or (cid:210)minority na-
tionalities(cid:211) are not (cid:210)indigenous peoples.(cid:211)

The category has been accepted by states outside the Americas. There was
never any question that Australia and New Zealand had indigenous minorities.
The governments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland came to accept that the Saami
were indigenous. This constituted recognition by an indigenous majority of the
indigenous status of a minority within the state, a somewhat different situation
than in the Americas. The Soviet Union denied it had (cid:210)indigenous peoples(cid:211) but
began to move from that position in the years before its collapse. The Russian Fed-
eration now recognises the (cid:210)small nations of the north(cid:211) as indigenous peoples. In
Asia the governments of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan refer to
certain peoples as indigenous.

The United Nations has consistently treated indigenous peoples as a special

case, separate from other cultural or racial minorities. Possibly the tribals and mi-
nority nationalities should be seen as cultural minorities, not indigenous peoples.
A distinction between indigenous peoples and cultural minorities is drawn by all
states in the Americas and Australasia. The traditions with uniform approaches to
indigenous peoples and other cultural minorities are the nationalities policies of
the former Soviet Union and China. The Russian Federation has moved away from
this linkage. China has not.

2 the issue over time

International Labor Organisation activity on indigenous peoples began with the
coordination of the Andean Indian Programme in the 1950s.3 ILO Convention 107
of 1957 spoke of both (cid:210)indigenous(cid:211) and (cid:210)tribal(cid:211) people. One part of the 1957 con-
vention referred to individuals who are  (cid:210)regarded as indigenous on account of
their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographi-
cal region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation.(cid:211)4
The convention was revised in 1989 as Convention 169. The new text has an inde-
pendent de(cid:222)nition of indigenous peoples: (cid:210)peoples in independent countries who
are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which
inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at
the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state bound-
aries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own so-
cial, economic, cultural and political institutions.(cid:211)5

The ILO has regularly suggested to the United Nations that it refer to both
(cid:210)indigenous(cid:211) and (cid:210)tribal(cid:211) peoples in its work, following the usage of the ILO. The
United Nations has continued to use (cid:210)indigenous(cid:211) alone. The state parties to the
ILO conventions are not limited to the Americas. Three Asian states, Bangladesh,
India, and Pakistan, are parties to Convention 107.6

International concern developed in the 1960s over the situation of Indians in
the Amazonian and forest interior of South America. The concern led to the for-
mation  of two  leading  nongovernmental  organizations:  Survival  International,
based in London, and the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, based
in Copenhagen. International indigenous organizations began in the mid-1970s,
with the formation of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Interna-
tional Indian Treaty Council, initiated by indigenous peoples in Canada and the
United States.7 The international support organizations and the international in-
digenous organizations did not con(cid:222)ne their concerns to the Americas and Aus-
tralasia. All saw the tribal or minority national peoples in Africa, Asia, and north-
ern Europe as entitled to consideration as indigenous.8

The Study on the Problem of Discrimination Against Indigenous Popula-

6 douglas e. sanders

tions, by Special Rapporteur Jos(cid:142) R. Mart(cid:146)nez Cobo, authorized in 1972 and re-
porting to the U.N. Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Pro-
tection of Minorities in 1983, developed an important (cid:210)working de(cid:222)nition(cid:211) of the
category:

379. Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a
historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that
developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other
sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them.
They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined
to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral
territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence
as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions
and legal systems.
380. This historical continuity may consist of the continuation, for an
extended period reaching into the present, of one or more of the following
factors:

(a) Occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them;
(b) Common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands;
(c) Culture in general, or in speci(cid:222)c manifestations (such as religion,

living under a tribal system, membership of an indigenous community,
dress, means of livelihood, life-style, etc.);

(d) Language (whether used as the only language, as mother-tongue, as

the habitual means of communication at home or in the family, or as the
main, preferred, habitual general or normal language);

(e) Residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of

the world;

(f ) Other relevant factors.

381. On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to
these indigenous populations through self-identi(cid:222)cation as indigenous
(group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations
as one of its members (acceptance by the group).9

The report also stresses the  (cid:210)right of indigenous peoples themselves to de(cid:222)ne
what and who is indigenous.(cid:211)10

The Working Group on Indigenous Populations, under the sub-commission,
began meeting in 1982. It allowed participation by any indigenous person or rep-
resentative of an indigenous community or organization. No accreditation process
was established that assessed indigenousness. Self-identi(cid:222)cation as indigenous was
accepted in practice. (cid:210)Indigenous(cid:211) representatives began attending from a num-
ber of states, including states that did not acknowledge the existence of any in-
digenous grouping within their population, notably Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,

indigenous peoples: issues of definition 7

and  Japan.  By  1982  Finland,  Norway,  and  Sweden  had  acknowledged  that  the
Saami living in their countries were an indigenous people. This established a prece-
dent for the recognition of a group as indigenous even where the majority popu-
lation in the state as a whole was indigenous or very old.

A Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples was established by General Assem-
bly Resolution 40/131 of 1985 to facilitate the attendance of indigenous delega-
tions. The fund has assisted participation by individuals from India, Bangladesh,
and other parts of Asia and Africa. One current member of the board of the fund
is a Maasi, suggesting that Maasi in Kenya are considered an indigenous people.
In 1982 the World Bank developed a policy statement on (cid:210)Tribal People in
Bank-Financed Projects,(cid:211) a response to problems in the (cid:222)eld.11 In 1991 the World
Bank revised its concerns in this area and issued Operational Directive 4.20 on (cid:210)In-
digenous Peoples.(cid:211) It contains a de(cid:222)nition: (cid:210)The terms (cid:212)indigenous peoples,(cid:213) (cid:212)in-
digenous ethnic minorities,(cid:213) (cid:212)tribal groups,(cid:213) and (cid:212)scheduled tribes(cid:213) describe social
groups with a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that
makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process. For the
purposes of this directive, (cid:212)indigenous peoples(cid:213) is the term that will be used to refer
to these groups.(cid:211) This is not so much a de(cid:222)nition as a description of a group of
categories brought together by reason of shared patterns of vulnerability. Clearly,
it is not in fact required by this formulation that a (cid:210)tribal group(cid:211) in World Bank
usage actually be (cid:210)indigenous.(cid:211)The directive goes on:

Because of the varied and changing contexts in which indigenous peoples are
found, no single de(cid:222)nition can capture their diversity. Indigenous people are
commonly among the poorest segments of a population. They engage in
economic activities that range from shifting agriculture in or near forests to
wage labor or even small-scale market-oriented activities. Indigenous peoples
can be identi(cid:222)ed in particular geographical areas by the presence in varying
degrees of the following characteristics:

(a) a close attachment to ancestral territories and to the natural

resources in these areas;

(b) self-identi(cid:222)cation and identi(cid:222)cation by others as members of a

distinct cultural group;

(c) an indigenous language, often different from the national language;
(d) presence of customary social and political institutions; and 
(e) primarily subsistence-oriented production.

Task managers (TMs) must exercise judgment in determining the pop-
ulations to which this directive applies and should make use of specialized
anthropological and sociological experts throughout the project cycle.

The directive also allowed special Indigenous Peoples Development Plans.

But some countries did not like the World Bank(cid:213)s use of the phrase (cid:210)indige-

8 douglas e. sanders

nous peoples.(cid:211) A discussion paper on reform of policy, issued in 1998, deals with
this issue:

One of the dif(cid:222)culties encountered in implementing OD 4.20 has been the
identi(cid:222)cation and de(cid:222)nition of (cid:210)indigenous peoples.(cid:211) In some of the Bank(cid:213)s
regions (e.g., Africa and large parts of Asia), there is a reluctance among
Borrower countries to the use of the term (cid:210)indigenous peoples(cid:211) because of
the general belief that all members of the respective national populations are
(cid:210)indigenous.(cid:211)Where vulnerable indigenous or tribal groups exist, there are
also numerous terms used to describe such groups (e.g., (cid:210)indigenous ethnic
minorities,(cid:211) (cid:210)national minorities,(cid:211) (cid:210)scheduled tribes,(cid:211) (cid:210)aboriginal groups,(cid:211)
(cid:210)remote area dwellers,(cid:211) (cid:210)hill tribes,(cid:211) etc.). These different regional and
national contexts and the varying usage of the terms make it dif(cid:222)cult to
obtain agreement on a common term or de(cid:222)nition to identify all of the
indigenous or tribal groups covered by the Bank(cid:213)s policy. However, because
the terminology is so varied, the term indigenous peoples has come to subsume
these different categories and usages, and its use is consistent with current
United Nations and academic discussions of the topic.12

The discussion paper essentially proposes the continuation of the World Bank(cid:213)s
quite open-ended approach.

The Working Group on Indigenous Populations completed the text of a De-
claration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 1993. The text avoids any de(cid:222)ni-
tion of (cid:210)indigenous.(cid:211)

Pressure continued from some states for a de(cid:222)nition. India was anxious to
gain support for its position that it had no (cid:210)indigenous(cid:211) people.13 An additional
de(cid:222)nitional concern developed in 1993 and 1994 when white groups from Namibia
and South Africa came to the working group claiming indigenous status, leading
to a protest letter signed by many indigenous delegates. Responding to these con-
cerns, Erica-Irene Daes, the chair of the working group, prepared a note on de(cid:222)ni-
tion  for  the  1995  meetings  of the  working  group.  Daes  concluded  that  the
Mart(cid:146)nez Cobo de(cid:222)nition had suf(cid:222)cient criteria to determine whether a person or
a community was indigenous. In the (cid:222)nal paragraph of the note, she recognized
that the de(cid:222)nition of the category (cid:210)is developing continually as more people from
different regions seek to participate in the Working Group and other international
activities.(cid:211)14

In the context of 1993, the International Year of the World(cid:213)s Indigenous Peo-
ple, and the current Decade of the World(cid:213)s Indigenous People, the United Nations
published material and hosted events that have suggested a broad interpretation of
indigenous status. Groupings from Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, and Kenya
have been featured in U.N. events or literature as indigenous. It has become com-
mon to say there are some 300 million indigenous people worldwide, belonging to

indigenous peoples: issues of definition 9

5,000 or so groups in more than 70 countries. In these statements, Asia is identi(cid:222)ed
as the region with the largest indigenous population.15

3 current approaches to definition

The author attempted a de(cid:222)nition in 1995. He proposed the following: (cid:210)An in-
digenous people is a collectivity which has descent from the earliest surviving pop-
ulation in the part of the State where the people traditionally lived (whether still
living in that area or, as a result of involuntary relocation, in another part of the
State) and which has a distinct identity associated with its history.(cid:211)16 Indigenous
minorities could be recognized in states with indigenous majorities. The de(cid:222)nition
also dealt with the problem of forced relocation, a common problem for tribes in
the United States.

The most signi(cid:222)cant attempt to date to exclude parts of the south from
United Nations work on indigenous issues has come in the (cid:222)nal report of the
Cuban Special Rapporteur, Miguel Alfonso Martinez, in the Study on Treaties,
Agreements, and Other Constructive Arrangements between States and Indige-
nous Populations. While western nongovernmental organizations and academic
commentators have supported extending the use of the term (cid:210)indigenous,(cid:211) Al-
fonso  Martinez  was  sympathetic  to  the  concerns  of states  in  the  south  who
wanted the term con(cid:222)ned to the West and Latin America. Alfonso Martinez
wrote that he would con(cid:222)ne his study to (cid:210)situations in which the indigenous peo-
ples(cid:213) category is already established beyond any doubt from a historical and mod-
ern day point of view,(cid:211) suggesting that the distinction he draws may not prove
durable.17

Alfonso Martinez argued that the category of indigenous people should be
con(cid:222)ned to populations in states with national populations established by colonial
migration, whether the new national population retains foreign racial and cultural
characteristics or is mestizo. This con(cid:222)nes the term to states where there was (cid:210)the
organised colonialisation, by European powers, of peoples inhabiting since time
immemorial, territories on other continents.(cid:211) Quite different, in his view, are cases
of the (cid:210)territorial expansion by Indigenous nations into adjacent areas.(cid:211)18 In the
latter cases, one (cid:222)nds (cid:210)state-oppressed peoples(cid:211) and (cid:210)minorities.(cid:211)19

It is important, he argues, to have a (cid:210)clear-cut distinction between Indigenous
peoples and national and ethnic minorities.(cid:211)20 Minorities, under existing interna-
tional instruments and standards, are entitled to individual rights. Indigenous peo-
ples (cid:210)justly attach considerable importance(cid:211) to their collective rights.21 (cid:210)It should
be recalled that many representatives of what they describe as State-oppressed
groups/minorities/peoples in Africa and Asia have brought their case before the
Working Group on Indigenous Populations for lack of other venues to which to

10 douglas e. sanders

submit their grievances. This situation is now being remedied with the establish-
ment of the Working Group on Minorities.(cid:211)22

For most of its life, the Working Group on Indigenous Populations was the
only forum in the United Nations dealing with cultural minorities. In 1992 the
General Assembly approved the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging
to National, Ethnic, Religious, and Linguistic Minorities. In 1995 a working group
of the subcommission was established to monitor compliance with the declara-
tion. The primary force behind the establishment of the working group and its
(cid:222)rst chair is Asbjorn Eide, of Norway, who was the (cid:222)rst chair of the Working
Group on Indigenous Populations. The new working group, however, has been es-
tablished out of concern with the negative consequences of ethnonationalism in
the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union. It seems unlikely that the new
working group will become the same user-friendly forum that the Working Group
on Indigenous Populations did. Groups such as tribal peoples in India are still
more likely to come to (cid:210)indigenous(cid:211) forums at the United Nations than the new
(cid:210)minority(cid:211) working group.

Alfonso Martinez(cid:213)s study is on treaties, and he suggests that treaties (cid:210)tended
not to be(cid:211) characteristic of the Asian and African situations he is excluding from
consideration. 

85. It must be underlined, however, that the Special Rapporteur has not
been in a position to assess all possible overlaps and contradictions of every
treaty-related issue and the overall Indigenous problematique in the African
and Asian contexts.
86. Moreover in this connection, it can be validly argued that the legacy of
(cid:210)protected(cid:211) tribal areas in Africa and Asia (especially in regions formerly 
included in the British colonial empire, for example in India and southern
Africa) has raised a number of speci(cid:222)c problems(cid:209)particularly when
re(cid:223)ected in the work of some international organisations, such as the ILO
and the Organisation of American States(cid:209)that has contributed to the 
confusion on the issue of the well-established, clear-cut minorities/
indigenous dichotomy.

Indeed, the distinction Alfonso Martinez makes between situations of indigenous
expansion and those of colonialization from overseas raises quite a number of
questions. By his analysis, there are no indigenous peoples in the Nordic states, the
Russian Federation, Taiwan, or Malaysia (contrary to the views of the state gov-
ernments in each of these cases). Questions are also raised about Japan, where
some limited recognition of the Ainu as indigenous has occurred.

In 1998 Benedict Kingsbury published his article (cid:210)Indigenous Peoples(cid:211) in In-
ternational Law: A Constructivist Approach to the Asian Controversy.23 It reviewed the history
of attempts to de(cid:222)ne (cid:210)indigenous peoples(cid:211) and described current patterns of state
practice  in  Asia.  In  line  with  the  general  positions  of Western  scholars,  non-

indigenous peoples: issues of definition 11

governmental organizations, and intergovernmental bodies, Kingsbury was sym-
pathetic to the extension of the category outside the Americas and Australasia. To
respond to arguments from India that it was problematic to try to assess which
populations were the earliest in the subcontinent, Kingsbury did not want the
strict historical test to be key in a de(cid:222)nition. He suggested a (cid:210)(cid:223)exible(cid:211) (cid:210)construc-
tivist(cid:211) approach, with the following suggested elements:

Essential Requirements
(cid:209)self-identi(cid:222)cation as a distinct ethnic group
(cid:209)historical experience of, or contingent vulnerability to, severe disruption,
dislocation or exploitation
(cid:209)long connection with the region
(cid:209)the wish to retain a distinct identity
Relevant Indicia
(1) Strong Indicia

(cid:209)nondominance in the national (or regional) society (ordinarily
required)
(cid:209)close cultural af(cid:222)nity with a particular area of land or territories 
(ordinarily required)
(cid:209)historical continuity (especially by descent) with prior occupants of
land in the region

(2) Other Relevant Indicia

(cid:209)socioeconomic and sociocultural differences from the ambient 
population
(cid:209)distinct objective characteristics such as language, race, and material
or spiritual culture
(cid:209)regarded as indigenous by the ambient population or treated as such
in legal and administrative arrangements.

The problems of formulating a de(cid:222)nition are clear when one considers that the
Quebecois arguably meet all the required criteria, only clearly failing on nonessen-
tial indicia.

As these attempted de(cid:222)nitions indicate, there continue to be differing ap-
proaches(cid:209)from the open-ended language of the World Bank to de(cid:222)nitions that
focus on attachment to land plus vulnerability(cid:209)to formulations where historical
descent from the earliest population is required. As well, of course, there is the ap-
proach that avoids a de(cid:222)nition on the basis that there is a core group of peoples
who are included, and future applications of the category can evolve with changes
in state practice and international understandings. The lack of a consensus on a
de(cid:222)nition, or even on the need for a de(cid:222)nition, should not obscure the fact that a
range of nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations have institution-
alized a concern with (cid:210)indigenous peoples,(cid:211) bringing the category within contem-
porary international human rights discourse and practice. Peoples in various parts

12 douglas e. sanders

of the south now claim indigenous status. The debate is not theoretical. It poses
real and basic questions about human diversity and cultural survival.

2. Almost everywhere the indigenous peoples are easily identi(cid:222)able as distinct from settler or
mestizo populations. The M(cid:142)tis in Canada are recognized by the constitution as a separate
(cid:210)aboriginal(cid:211) people, a designation that might not be accepted internationally. Some indigenous
groups have absorbed a relatively large number of nonindigenous people. Such racial mixture,
on its own, is not seen as ending the indigenous status of the collectivity.
3. The ILO published a book, Indigenous Peoples: Living and Working Conditions of Aboriginal Popula-
tions in Independent Countries (Geneva 1953), that commented on the de(cid:222)nitional problems. Not-

it was (cid:210)increasingly dif(cid:222)cult to (cid:222)nd a reliable and generally applicable test to distinguish be-
tween the aborigines and the rest of the population.(cid:211)This was written in the context of work
that promoted assimilation.

at that time felt that the term (cid:210)indigenous(cid:211) had application to the tribal peoples in India, a
view from which India has departed.
