In Australia, the authorised heritage discourse contributes to shaping the stereotypically
Australian. It actively engages in creating a contemporary national story which glosses over
the  more  shameful  or  distasteful  episodes  and  themes  in  Australian  colonial  and  post-
colonial history which is presented as being by-and-large progressive and benign. While the
process  of  forging  national  history  has  become  more  complex  and  increasingly  fraught,
given globalisation and the emergence of new histories, nation and nationalism remain
culturally persistent. The turn to multiculturalism from the 1970s as the principal way of
defining Australianness and the nation lead some conservatives in politics and the heritage
industry to appropriate the new social history, using it to present diversity as an indicator
of a fair and open society. In this process, both history—an evolving academic discipline—
and  the  past—lived  experience  which  has  meanings  and  uses  in  the  present—were
transformed into heritage.

In  recent  years,  a  number  of  scholars  have  advanced  the  notion  that  there  is  an
authorised heritage discourse, evident in countries such as Australia, England, Canada
and the USA, that is propagated by officially endorsed heritage agencies, both public
and private.1 ‘There is, really’, as Laurajane Smith has observed, ‘no such thing as heri-
tage … there is rather a hegemonic discourse about heritage, which acts to constitute

the  way  we  think,  talk  and  write  about  heritage’.2  This  discourse  legitimises  and
reproduces national narratives and social orders. As Smith and others acknowledge,
however,  this  process  is  complex.  This  is  particularly  evident  in  cultural  practices
that are  not  often  directly  linked  to  the  heritage  industry—commemoration  and
memorialisation.

The rise of ‘retrospective commemoration’ and ‘participatory memorialisation’ have
had impacts, to various degrees and in a range of places and at different times, on the
authorised heritage discourse.3 Retrospective commemoration refers to the effort of
State authorities at all levels to express a more inclusive narrative of the nation as a
result of, among other things, multicultural policy, by retrospectively commemorating
a  wider  number  of  communities  and  people  who  have  been  officially  identified  as
having contributed to Australia’s ‘national development’. New histories, or the emer-
gence of previously hidden histories, also drive retrospective memorialisation. Partici-
patory memorialisation concerns a range of vernacular memorials initiated by groups
or individuals which have been later taken up or taken over by government authorities,
or which have been sustained over short or long periods of time in conflict with them.
These can range from the ephemeral to more formal, permanent memorials.

Responses  to  these  public  forms  of  memorialisation  and  commemoration  have
highlighted  the  resilience  of  the  authorised  heritage  discourse  which  by  and  large
incrementally and gradually accommodates social and historiographical change in a
conservative revisionist paradigm. In Australia, this is driven in large part by a nation-
alism  based  on  multiculturalism.  Participatory  memorialisation  and  retrospective
commemoration  can  also  ultimately  stem  from  a  desire  to  ‘fit  in’  with  dominant
national narratives.

Memorials, however, remain amongst the most contested and enduring forms of
public history. And they are both central to cementing shared cultural meanings about
the past and at times blunt statements difficult to disregard. As material culture embed-
ded in the landscape, their meanings inevitably change over time between generations
and social groups.4 They serve as a lasting visual referent or ‘anchor points’ for former
mentalities  or  previous  acts  of  remembrance.5  As  cultural  heritage,  memorials  can
engage or disappear in progressive nationalist narratives.

As Paula Hamilton and Linda Shopes have observed, cultural heritage in this context
can be thought of as a ‘socially sanctioned, institutionally supported process of produc-
ing memories that make certain versions of the past public and render other versions
invisible’.6  But  as  Katharine  Hodgkin  and  Susannah  Radstone  among  others  note,
memory studies have been ‘located most firmly in disciplines most accustomed to a
concern  with  representation:  literature,  film  studies,  cultural  studies’.7  Academic
historians  have  tended  to  leave  discussions  around  memory  to  the  ‘applied’  field—
some would say sub-field—of public history.8 Likewise, as Smith has commented, in
archaeology,  ‘work  on  “archaeological  data”  that  may  also  be  perceived  as
someone else’s  “heritage”  is  relegated  to  “public  archaeology”  or  “cultural  resource
management”’.9

Memory studies deals with memory across generations in a range of social practices
including commemoration and memorialisation. And it focuses on the production,

circulation, reception and reproduction of cultural or collective memory.10 Some have
questioned  the  limits  of  this  approach  in  terms,  for  example,  of  striking  a  balance
between individual and group memory.11 Here, however, the emphasis is on the role
of  institutionally  supported  memories  in  forging  broader  cultural  memory  through
heritage via a new settlement ideology, multiculturalism, which replaced assimilation
in the 1970s.

The creation and re-creation of cultural memory has become increasingly complex
and  fraught  in  Australia,  as  elsewhere,  from  the  closing  decades  of  the  twentieth
century. At Federation in 1901, when Australia’s six separate and squabbling colonies
came together as a Commonwealth, the new nation’s heritage was relatively uncompli-
cated. Leaving aside sectarianism, over 96% of the population were Christians and of
its 3.7 million people, around 78% were Australian born, and all but 3% of the rest were
from  Britain.  The  bible  of  White  Australia—the  Federal  census—precluded  Indige-
nous people being counted among the Commonwealth’s population. This continued
until a Federal referendum in 1967 altered the constitution allowing Indigenous people
‘to be counted in reckoning the population’.12

Towards the end of the twentieth century, stories of stolen generations of Aboriginal
people—brought about by the official policy of removing mixed race children from
their families up to the 1970s—of migrants who had faced racial discrimination and
exploitation and of segregation and exclusion were circulating uncomfortably in the
culture.  These  fed  Australia’s  history  wars.13  Australians,  David  Carter  has  written,
were ‘not used to thinking about our history as contentious, morally compromised or
volatile, as dangerous as, say Japanese or South African history, the American Civil War
history, or recent Russian history’.14

This  article  is  based  on  a  case  study  of  the  Snowy  Mountain  Hydro-Electricity
Scheme which has been cast and recast, principally by public institutions, as both a
crucible  and  symbol  of  Australian  national  identity  in  an  evolving  consensual,
positivist  history.  It  also  draws  on  an  investigation  of  four  substantial  State  and
Federal heritage  database  memorial  listings  and  a  national  survey  of  post-1960
Australian non-war memorials.15

The Snowy Mountains Scheme

Commenced in October 1949 and completed in 1974, the Snowy Mountains Scheme
supplies  electricity  to  the  south-eastern  grid  and  a  buttress  against  drought  for
Australia’s  arid  inland.  Located  in  the  Southern  Alps—largely  in  the  Kosciuszko
National Park—it comprises 16 substantial dams—the biggest of which has a volume
13  times  that  of  Sydney  Harbour—aqueduct  pipelines  stretching  80  kilometres,
13 major tunnels in excess of 140 kilometres, three service towns, around 120 work
camps, seven power stations and eight switching stations. With the workforce peaking
at 7300 in 1959, over 100,000 people from over 30 countries—more than 60,000 of
whom  were  post-war  migrants  and  displaced  persons  that  the  Snowy  Mountains
Authority recruited in Europe—were employed on what became the largest engineer-
ing project undertaken in Australia.16 Only about 2% of the Snowy Mountains scheme

is visible above the ground. But this vast complex has taken on different meanings over
time.

During the opening of the third Festival of the Snows and the unveiling of the music
shell and model of the Snowy Mountains area on 17 October 1959 in Centennial Park,
Cooma, Nelson Lennon, Commonwealth Minister for Works and Housing, was given
the additional task of unveiling a 1.5 metre rock bearing a small brass plaque which
included a final paragraph: 

MANY MEN WHO BUILT THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS SCHEME CAME FROM
OTHER  COUNTRIES.  ON  THIS  DATE  THE  TENTH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE
COMMENCEMENT  OF  THE  SCHEME,  FLAGS  OF  THEIR  NATIONS  WERE
UNFURLED IN REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR BIRTHPLACES, THEIR CULTURE
AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA.17

These men’s ethnicity, however, was to fade out of the image of the Snowy. Instead,
they  were  incorporated  into  a  larger  account  of  progress  and  national  efficiency.
National  efficiency,  a  term  widely  used  in  the  first  three  decades  of  the  twentieth
century but still pervasive in official policy in Australia after World War II, called for
‘the most efficient adaptation of means to produce the highest welfare and civilisation
of a people and to ensure its survival against internal diseases and the attacks of other
nations’.18 Social and national efficiency depended upon three essential ingredients:
industrial  competency,  social  harmony  and  the  organisation  of  society  to  facilitate
social progress. In the post-World War II period, the Snowy Scheme was an icon for
the project of forging a modern, homogeneous Australia. This had led Labor Prime
Minister Ben Chifely to declare the scheme ‘one of the greatest milestones on the march
of Australia to full national development’.19

Assimilation,  the  dominant  settlement  ideology  from  the  1930s  into  the  1960s,
sought to make the entire population of the continent live like ‘white Australians’. It
also worked to make difference either ‘disappear’ or be suspected and feared. Grahame
Griffin, who has written about the Snowy Mountains Authority’s publicity machine,
notes that it sought to tie the scheme into the broader national assimilationist project
while also promoting the rugged natural landscape—incorporating the snow-covered
alps—as  symbolic  of  Australian  identity.  This,  it  was  hoped,  would  replace  the
traditional Australian ‘outback’ as the iconic image of national identity. Griffin recalls
his and others’ experience of the Authority’s visitor programme: 

… the most common recollections of childhood visits to the scheme encompass the
‘rugged grandeur’ of the Southern Alps, the excitement of seeing snow for the first
time, and the various stop-off points where one took in the panoramic views of the
massive construction sites and the distant, ant-like workers. This may well have been
as close as many visitors came to the people who built the Snowy Mountains scheme.
As a young visitor I knew that many of these workers were New Australians, or, more
commonly,  foreigners  (as  my  parents  described  them)  and  therefore  different—a
difference underlined by the strict segregation of workers from visitors. ‘Staff’ and
waged labourers also had separate messing and accommodation.20

These ‘New Australians’, or Australians in-the-making—indistinguishable from their
Australian co-workers when viewed from scenic vantage points or in the Authority’s

copious photographic images which Griffin discusses—were, like the nation’s pioneers
in the ‘outback’, facing hardship and the vicissitudes of nature that would help forge
their new character.

It was not until the late 1970s that the migrants who worked on the Snowy scheme
were publicly acknowledged. Laura Neal’s heroic Snowy Mountains Story was published
by  Cooma  Municipal  Council  in  1979.21  And  in  1981,  on  the  Monaro  Highway  at
Cooma North, a memorial was erected by the Council and the Authority to the 121
people ‘of over thirty nationalities’ who were killed during the Scheme’s construction.
The names of all of the dead appear in raised letters on bronze plaques. A central bronze
plaque at the monument’s base in bas relief depicts a dam and tunnels being built.22
Inspired in part by developments in labour and immigration history,23 cultural tourism
and a nascent heritage industry, this memoralisation was framed in the context of the
new settlement ideology—multiculturalism—that emerged in Australia in the 1970s.
Canadian in origin, the term multiculturalism was first used in Australia in 1973 by
the Federal Minister for Immigration, Al Grasby. It was based on notions of ‘justice,
equality  and  esteem’  and  was  principally  concerned  with  acknowledging  ethnic
diversity.  Replacing  assimilation,  multiculturalism  encompassed 
‘government
measures  designed  to  respond  to  that  diversity’.  Playing  no  role  in  the  selection  of
migrants,  it  was  and  remains  ‘a  policy  for  managing  the  consequences  of  cultural
diversity in the interests of the individual and society as a whole’.24

In mono-cultural Australia, migrants were expected to ‘fit in’; in the new multicul-
tural regime their difference was tolerated. Conservative critics of the policy warned of
challenges  to  national  cohesion  and  potential  social  dislocation.  Professor  Geoffrey
Blainey claimed that: 

Multicultural policy has, at times, tended to emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities
at the expense of the majority of Australians, thus unnecessarily encouraging divisions
and weakening social cohesion. It has tended to be anti-British and yet the people
from  the  United  Kingdom  and  Ireland  form  the  dominant  class  of  pre-war
immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.25

As Castles and others have observed, however, multiculturalism had become a ‘neces-
sary ideology’.26 It was and remains a product of major cultural and social shifts. And
far from undermining national identity and cohesion, it quickly became the new way
of defining Australianness and the nation, leaving unquestioned the construct of the
‘nation’, nationalism and continued inequalities in Australian society.

Public attention was to be sharply re-focused on the Snowy Mountains scheme in
1999 during the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of its construction.27 A Federal
inquiry into Snowy River water, developments in the national electricity market and
plans  for  further  corporatisation  of  the  Scheme  led  the  Authority,  in  a  period  of
uncertainty,  to  mount  over  three  years  a  public  relations  campaign  to  secure  its
future.28 The campaign was so successful that the Scheme’s anniversary attracted front
page  attention  nationally  as  well  as  radio  and  television  coverage.29  In  Sydney,  the
Powerhouse Museum mounted an exhibition entitled ‘Snow! Power of a nation’.30

While  the  massive  engineering  feat  and  the  Scheme’s  place  in  building  modern
Australia were lauded, a key theme in the campaign was the Scheme’s contribution to

386 P. Ashton

making a multicultural Australia. As one national newspaper noted at the beginning of
1999: 

This  year  Australia  consciously  and  actively  celebrates  the  50th  anniversary  of  the
Snowy  Mountains  Hydro-Electricity  Scheme  which  brought  upwards  of  100,000
migrants into the country. Most of these stayed and contributed most positively to the
expansion of the economy in the 1950s and 1960s.31

Heritage agencies took a fresh look at the scheme. Noting that, like ‘many other 20th
century places, the heritage significance of the Snowy Mountains Scheme is only just
being recognised’, the New South Wales Heritage Office (abolished by the State Labor
Government  in  2008)  observed,  among  other  things,  that  ‘The  scheme  brought
together a workforce of more than 30 nationalities and has been seen as a monument
to  multicultural  Australia’.32  Given  its  national  importance,  the  Scheme  was  subse-
quently placed on the Register of the National Estate which was administered by the
Australian Heritage Commission.33 Reflecting the New South Wales Heritage Office’s
assessment, the scheme’s statement of cultural significance began: 

The  Snowy  Mountains  Scheme  (SMS),  constructed  1949–1974,  is  the  largest  engi-
neering scheme ever undertaken in Australia, and is nationally and internationally
important for its engineering success and as a symbol of Australian achievement. The
scheme  employed  over  100,000  people,  from  thirty  different  nationalities,  and  is
significant in the history of Australia’s post-World War II migration. It can be consid-
ered a major basis of Australian multi-cultural society.34

This statement is repeated in the Federal Australian Heritage Places Inventory and in
other sites such as the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Water, Heritage
and the Arts Culture and Recreation Portal.35 During the fiftieth anniversary celebra-
tions, it was also circulated via official speeches and media releases. At the celebrations
at  Jindabyne  on  17  October  1999,  for  example,  Prime  Minister  John  Howard  paid
tribute to a scheme that helped to: 

Build  the  modern  Australia.  But  …  even  more  importantly  than  that  the  Snowy
Mountains Scheme was an amazing Australian achievement bringing people together
and binding them into one mighty Australian workforce … as I moved through the
crowd  today,  it’s  a  reminder  to  me  of  the  incredible  range  of  nationalities,  of
ethnicities, of people of different cultures, of different language, many of whom may
have had the odd argument with each other before they came to Australia, but once
they came to Australia they all found in this new welcoming tolerant country a new
homeland.36

Likewise, the Governor-General of Australia, Sir William Deane, said a few months
earlier on the occasion of the launch of the book A Vision for Australia: The Snowy
Mountains Scheme 1949–1999, that the ‘Snowy … project can … truly “lay claim to
being the birthplace of Australian multiculturalism”’.37

The Heritage Industry

The incorporation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme into the nation’s officially recog-
nised  heritage  demonstrates  at  one  level  the  influence  of  ideology  and  government

policy on heritage discourse. Here, heritage is enlisted by the State to accommodate
social and cultural change—the relatively rapid transition of Australia from a mono-
to a multicultural society—and minimise social conflict. The Snowy is not primarily
remembered as a site of racial tension and partial segregation, as a place of hard, dirty
and  dangerous  labour  undertaken  by  foreigners  recruited  specifically  to  undertake
work  most  Australians  did  not  want  to  do,  or  one  of  binge  drinking,  fighting  and
prostitution,  all  of  which  it  was.  At  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  Snowy
became a symbol of national unity in diversity and the crucible from which emerged
Australian  multiculturalism,  which  it  was  not.  Minorities,  however,  can  choose  to
collaborate with such officially endorsed, revised versions of the past. Collaboration

388 P. Ashton

leads  to  consensual,  utilitarian  pasts  that  incorporate  marginal  groups  into  main-
stream narratives.38

Listing also inevitably draws places and their meanings into heritage systems and
formal  practices  and  into  the  worlds  of  the  bureaucrat  and  the  heritage  specialist.
Technical mechanisms, such as heritage lists, are not value free. Their conceptualisa-
tion  and  construction  overtly  and  covertly  shape  official  stocks  of  heritage  and
perceptions of what constitutes heritage.

Table 1 reports the findings of the searches of the four selected Australian heritage
databases: the Federal Australian Heritage Database; the Victorian Heritage Register
and  Heritage  Inventory;  the  New  South  Wales  Heritage  Office  Local  and  State
Government Agencies Listings; and the Heritage Council of Western Australia’s Places
Database.39  Each  of  the  database  search  outcomes  was  examined  thematically.  An
initial  reading  of  the  results,  however,  indicated  a  dominance  of  war  memorials,
churches and church buildings and cemeteries. In the final count, of the 1524 listed
items examined, 562 (or 36.9%) were war memorials. While these comprised almost a
quarter of Federal listings (175 out of 721) almost half of New South Wales’ listings
were  war  memorials  (167  out  of  341)  and  they  accounted  for  55.6%  of  Western
Australia’s memorials (194 out of 349).

After  war  memorials,  churches  were  the  next  highest  category  on  the  listings
(174 items  or  11.4%).  This  was  followed  by  the  role  that  individuals  played  in  the
community (112 or 7.3%), cemeteries (60 or 4%), memorials to collective community
roles  (36  or  2.3%)  and  personal  memorials  (30  or  2%).  Thus  48.3%  of  all  listings
related to war and churches. It might be contended that this is not surprising given the
relatively broad time span—dating back to initial colonisation—covered by the listed
heritage items. But the lists themselves were all created during the last three decades. In
1979,  four  years  after  the  establishment  of  the  Australian  Heritage  Commission,
Professor Ray Whitmore, Chair of the Commission, bluntly noted that: 

An interplanetary traveller landing in Queensland today and turning to the listings of
the  National  Trust  of  Queensland  or  the  Register  of  the  National  Estate  for  an
appreciation of the life and achievements of her citizens since settlement would be
presented with a strange picture. He would conclude that her forefathers lived in fine
colonial homes, made banks and churches their principal monuments, invested in
practically no public utilities, and hardly ever went to work.40

The Queensland Heritage Act, which established that State’s heritage register, was not
passed  until  1992.  Western  Australia’s  Heritage  Act  came  into  being  during  the
previous year. Victoria’s Historic Buildings (Amendment) Act was assented to in 1989.
The current Victorian Heritage Register, however, was legislatively established in 1995.
New South Wales’s Heritage Act was assented to at the end of 1977, though its current
State heritage inventory was not set up until the early 1990s.

It  was  not  any  shortage  of  non-war  or  non-religious  memorials  that  drive  these
listings. A survey of non-war memorials in Australia identified an abundant diversity
of  these  across  the  country  (see  Table  2).  Only  30,  however,  of  the  378  memorials
identified—or  8%—had  formal  heritage  listings.41  Clearly,  it  is  not  possible  to  list
everything.  But  there  are  obvious  limitations—evident  in  Table  1  which  reflects  an

antiquated but officially dominant historical narrative—to heritage registers and lists
that attempt to both frame the national and serve national agendas. Imagine a history
of Australia which drew primarily on the memorials in the Federal and State heritage
databases. It would certainly be an ‘official’ history—a history endorsed by its subject,
the nation state—positive in tone with an underlying theme of progress. There would
be few civil or natural disasters of any kind in such an account of the nation unless they
highlighted unity in diversity and the indomitable Australian spirit. Migrant commu-
nities would be largely silent and Indigenous communities relegated to a brief mention
and a footnote (much Aboriginal heritage is registered on separate lists such as the one
for New South Wales formerly managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service,
which is dominated by pre-contact heritage and excludes places such as fringe camps
and lockups).42 The role of individuals in community formation would form a theme,
but  most  of  these  people  would  be  explorers,  pioneers,  politicians  or  people  with
property. Overall, this would be a history of the forging of a modern nation through
sacrifice and the emergence of a masculine Australian identity.

Notes: [1] Memorials to natural and civil disasters, sudden death—including road fatalities—migrant and 
Indigenous communities, animals and disease—such as AIDS —as well as personal memorials are self 
explanatory. Individual community rolepertains to individuals who are remembered by communities for 
their various contributions, community role relates to the memorialisation of collective roles that com-
munities have played. These include memorials to emergency service workers, timber getters who 
opened up areas of Australia and started up an industry and organizations such as the Country Women’s 
Association. Violation concerns memorials to those who have been murdered, raped or abused. The 
memorial to child sexual abuse in Hobart, Tasmania, is an example of the latter. Lost places (time) con-
cerns memorials to places that have disappeared with the passage of time; lost places (state) to places 
that have been removed by ofﬁcial dictate.

The Tadeusz Kosciuszko Memorial

State classificatory taxonomies and heritage listings have traditionally shaped what is
considered  significant  and  worthy  of  remembrance.43  But  there  is  an  interaction
between official paradigms and popular forms of memoralisation out of which emerge
shifts in understandings of the past and changes to rituals and meanings in relation to
memorials and commemorations.

While  formal  heritage  listings  clearly  privilege  certain  kinds  of  memorials  over
others, official versions of the past as expressed through memorials come under contin-
uous  pressures,  subtle  and  otherwise,  to  adapt  to  cultural  and  social  change,  new
knowledge or rediscovered pasts. Adaptations are more profound after periods of rapid
change when the gap between official pasts and realities become untenable or when
different groups become more powerful and are able to insert themselves into official
histories. The latter process is about ‘fitting in’.

On  the  Snowy  Mountains  Highway  at  Cooma  in  New  South  Wales  there  is  a  six
metre high memorial to Tadeusz Kosciuszko (see Figure 1). Stainless steel with a bust,
its plaque in part reads:

Tadeusz Kosciuszko
1746–1817
The Polish patriot and hero, spent most of his life
fighting for the freedom of his country.
A champion of the underprivileged and oppressed in Poland, he went to America to
become one of George Washington’s generals, gaining much honour in the war of
independence. In Thomas Jefferson’s words, he was ‘as pure a son of liberty as I have
ever known’.

Polish  explorer  Count  Paul  Edmund  Strzelecki  named  Mt  Kociuszko  in  1840.  The
plaque indicates that he also ‘discovered’ the mountain, thus ignoring its Aboriginal
past.  The  monument  was  raised  by  the  Federal  Council  of  Polish  Associations  in
Australia  ‘as  a  gift  to  the  people  of  Australia  in  the  Bicentennial  year  1988’.  While
commemorating  the  mountain’s  ‘discovery’  and  naming,  it  is  equally  if  not  more
concerned  with  remembering,  as  noted  on  the  plaque,  ‘the  contribution  of  Polish
settlers to the Snowy Mountain Scheme’. Thus the monument links Polish Australians
during  the  country’s  largest  national  celebration  into  the  major  founding  myth  of
nation—‘discovery’—and  into  the  post-World  War  II  project  of  building  modern
Australia.  It  also  demonstrates  the  power  of  that  dominant  though  largely  silent
ideology in Australian history and society—respectability—with its promise of esteem
and  social  acceptability.  Principal  contributors,  as  listed  on  the  plaque,  were  the
Government  of  New  South  Wales,  the  Polish  Association  of  New  South  Wales,  the
Major Stanslaw and Dr Maria Luk-Kozika Foundation, Maria and Henry Syriatowicz,
Contal Co. Pty Ltd, the Polish Associations in Newcastle and Hobart, the Polish Ex-
Servicemen’s  Association  (sub-branch  3,  Melbourne)  and  B.  and  K.  Singler.  As  K.
Anthony Appiah reminds us: 

Hobbs  spoke  of  the  desire  for  glory  as  one  of  the  dominating  impulses  of  human
beings, one that was bound to make trouble for social life. But glory can consist in
fitting and being seen to fit into a collection history, and so, in the name of glory, one
can end up doing the most social of all things.44

National unity, as Stratton and Ang contend, can only be represented ‘by suppression
and repression, symbolic or otherwise, of difference’ or by incorporation.45

The  Kosciuszko  memorial  might  be  considered  a  form  of  ‘positive’  revisionism.
Polish people are here incorporated into a story of democratic nation building, not
without  struggle  and  suffering,  but  with  progress  for  all  as  its  ultimate  outcome.
Memorials such as this, which is now part of a heritage trail, tend to be untouched by
vandals and do not receive calls for their removal. Far less able to be incorporated into
official pasts, however, are shameful or forbidden histories. But when they are officially
recognised, to whatever degree, these acts of ‘negative’ revisionism can be confronting
and  highly  disturbing.  They  destabilise  the  historical  foundations  upon  which  a
supposedly comfortable, tolerant and multicultural society rests. And they can confront
individuals  over  their  own  pasts.  Australian  examples  include  memorials  to  the
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Stolen Generations—Indigenous people who as
children were forcibly removed from their families under the policy of assimilation—
which are springing up around the country.46

392 P. Ashton

One  such  memorial  was  unveiled  in  Darwin’s  Botanic  Gardens  in  the  Northern
Territory  on  30  July  2005  (see  Figure  2).47  Highly  visible,  well  maintained  and
frequently visited, this memorial materially inscribes the burden of needing to make
this history publicly known. Its four large plaques provide a map indicating where the
stolen children were taken in the Northern Territory; a detailed list of the legislation
which bestowed powers to control and remove Indigenous people; a message to future
generations; an extract from a speech by Prime Minister Paul Keating acknowledging
dispossession, discrimination, exclusion and the removal of children; and a four stanza
poem which begins: 

Mothers left with empty arms
Hearts broken, minds with no calm.
Children without an identity
Taken from their country. 48

This  memorial  almost  wails  a  history  that  had  been  suppressed  or  ignored  for  two
generations; its abundance of text—both official and personal—says: ‘This happened;
you cannot ignore it’. But it took a significant report commissioned by the New South
Wales Labor Government and produced in 1982 by historian Peter Read—who coined

the term ‘stolen generations’—and a $1.5 million Federal Labor Government inquiry
published in 1997 as Bringing Them Home—involving testimonies from hundreds of
Indigenous people—to have this history fully recognised.49

Memorials  to  victims  of  the  Acquired  Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS)
epidemic  are  also  growing  in  number.  AIDS  was  first  diagnosed  in  Australia  in
November  1982  at  St  Vincent’s  hospital  in  Sydney.  Public  anxiety  and  ignorance
about the disease, fuelled by media reports, led to acts of persecution and discrimina-
tion against gay people. Some politicians exacerbated this situation. Ian Sinclair, the
leader of the Federal National Party, blamed AIDS-related deaths on the Federal Labor
Government’s policy of ‘promotion of homosexuality as a norm’ given its decision to
develop  major  educational  programmes  to  fight  against  AIDS.50  The  virus  had  a
devastating impact on the gay community. But by the late 1980s it had also galvanised
that  community  politically  and  driven  the  establishment  of  an  annual  national
conference on AIDs, the formation of State-based People Living With Aids associa-
tions—which supported people in ‘coming out’ and advocated on the community’s
behalf—and the creation of State AIDS Councils. These groups became involved with
or initiated memorials to AIDS victims.

One  of  the  earliest  of  these  was  the  Fairfield  Aids  Memorial  Garden  which  was
established  in  the  grounds  of  Melbourne’s  Fairfield  Hospital  near  the  Yarra  River.
Work on the garden commenced in 1987 and it was opened by Ian Harris, who had
AIDS, on 9 April 1988.51 Another memorial garden was opened at Newcastle’s John
Hunter Hospital on World AIDS Day on 1 December 1994. Other memorials include
the Sydney Park AIDS Memorial Grove, plantings at which commenced in May 1994,
and the AIDS Memorial Bell which was installed in a peal of bells in St James’ Anglican
church  in  King  Street,  Sydney,  in  July  2003.  Memorials  to  AIDS  have  become  a
powerful part of the representation of a deeply sad but unifying part of this commu-
nity’s history. But in underscoring difference these memorials also provide a strong,
unambiguous  corrective  to  the  notion  of  a  quintessential  Australian  identity  or  a
homogeneous Australian community.52

Conclusion

Memorials  and  commemorations  allow  us  to  chart  the  complex  interactions  and
negotiations  between  officially  endorsed  historical  narratives,  public  and  privately
sponsored  memorials  and  commemorations  in  public  spaces  and  new  histories.  As
Ludmilla Jordanova reminds us, ‘the state … lies at the heart of public history’.53 And
this is evident in the public process of commemoration and memorialisation. At one
level, the State endorses certain narratives within which communities and organisa-
tions need to operate if they are to be officially part of the national story and its regional
and local variants. Ultimate endorsement for memorials includes listings on heritage
registers.  The  State,  however,  is  not  monolithic.  Permissible  pasts  evolve  over  time
given shifts in power and social and cultural change.

In Australia, the authorised heritage discourse contributes to shaping the stereotyp-
ically Australian. It actively engages in creating a contemporary national story which

394 P. Ashton

glosses  over  the  more  shameful  or  distasteful  episodes  and  themes  in  Australian
colonial and post-colonial history which is presented as being by-and-large progres-
sive  and  benign.  While  the  process  of  forging  national  history  has  become  more
complex  and  increasingly  fraught,  given  globalisation  and  the  emergence  of  new
histories,  as  Ien  Ang  and  others  have  noted,54  nation  and  nationalism  remain
culturally persistent.

The  turn  to  multiculturalism  from  the  1970s  as  the  principal  way  of  defining
Australianness  and  the  nation  lead  some  conservatives  in  politics  and  the  heritage
industry  to  appropriate  the  new  social  history,  using  it  to  present  diversity  as  an
indicator  of  a  fair  and  open  society.55  In  this  process,  both  history—an  evolving
academic discipline—and the past—lived experience which has meanings and uses in
the  present56—were  transformed  into  heritage  which,  as  David  Lowenthal  has
argued,  stands  ‘accused  of  undermining  historical  truth  [which  he  acknowledges  is
slippery] with twisted myth’.57 Migrant groups can contest authorised histories, thus
rejecting colonial and post-colonial relations of power,58 or collaborate with official
retrospective acknowledgements of their part in the national saga to gain a place in
the sun.
