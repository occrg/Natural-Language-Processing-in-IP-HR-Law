This article proposes a new index that seeks to measure the national strength of the
pharmaceutical intellectual property environment of a given country. This Pharmaceutical
IP Index focuses on four countries: the US, the UK, Singapore and Israel.

Keywords index; pharmaceuticals; IPRs; Patents

Introduction

This article proposes a model that seeks to measure the national strength of the
pharmaceutical intellectual property (IP) environment of a given country (herein-
after the ‘‘Pharmaceutical IP Index’’). The Pharmaceutical IP Index focuses on four
countries: the US, the UK, Singapore and Israel.

Much controversy surrounds the issue of pharmaceutical intellectual property
rights (IPRs). It is not a secret that debates concerning pharmaceutical IPRs have
become as emotional as they are rational, encompassing economic, legal and health
issues, and even questions of business ethics and morality.

The strength of IPRs in a given country is central to these debates. Indeed, the
question surrounding the implications of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and TRIP-plus standards—inter alia
whether such agreements establish IP standards that are too low or too high—is
at the core of these debates.

Yet, one of the most fundamental problems in the current public discussion on
the strength of pharmaceutical IPRs is the lack of sufﬁcient information about the
speciﬁc composition and weight of the total factors comprising a ‘‘national
pharmaceutical IP environment’’.

This article, therefore, proposes a model—and more speciﬁcally an index—that
may possibly measure the strength of national pharmaceutical IP environments
across different countries. As will be argued and elaborated below, statistical
measurements of the strength of IPRs at the national level have been in existence
(and used) since the late 1980s. Nevertheless, these measurements tend to describe
the overall strength of a given country’s IP regime. In contrast, the index proposed
in this article is sector-speciﬁc, insofar that it focuses on the speciﬁc IP character-
istics of the pharmaceutical industry. Arguably, a sector-speciﬁc index can be

applied to other industries (though not with the same components), such as in the
information technology (IT) sectors, the music and ﬁlm industries, etc.1

Two elements are essential for this exercise.
First, there is a need to construct a coherent and transparent method of
measuring pharmaceutical IP environments in the national context. This method
should strive to be as scientiﬁc and objective as possible in order to allow for an
accurate measurement of these environments. In doing so, it would be possible to
compare different pharmaceutical IP policy environments, as well as to establish the
relative strength or weakness of pharmaceutical IPRs in a given country.

Secondly, there is a need to create a broad template that would essentially allow
one to measure national pharmaceutical IP policy environments across the board.
In other words, while this analysis focuses on the national context, it should not be
conﬁned to a speciﬁc country, thereby allowing one to expand this analysis to other
countries, both developed and developing.

In order to pursue the above in a manner that is both academically viable and
operationally achievable, it is recommended that a new scaled index (or what is
usually referred to as ‘‘composite measurement’’),2 which measures IP protection
for pharmaceuticals, is constructed. The term index in its simplest form is deﬁned as
a ‘‘variable that is a summed composite of other variables that are assumed to
reﬂect some underlying construct’’.3 Scale construction is deﬁned as ‘‘the creation of
new variables from multiple items’’.4 It will be shown later that the proposed new
Pharmaceutical IP Index is a hybrid of these two statistical forms.

Finally, one important qualiﬁcation should be emphasized: that while the
Pharmaceutical IP Index may tell us which countries have stronger or weaker
pharmaceutical IP environments compared with other countries, it does not intend
to conclude that such regimes are good or bad. It is not in the capacity of this
article, nor is it the interest of this author, to link the resultant Pharmaceutical IP
Index to any kind of moral judgement. Clearly, each reader can draw his or her own
conclusions on the basis of his or her sets of beliefs and knowledge about the link
between pharmaceuticals and IPRs. In this context, it should also be noted that the
strength of the index is based on right-holders’ perspective, i.e. on what pharma-
ceutical companies perceive as a strong IP regime, thereby emphasizing further the
above qualiﬁcation.

Before focusing on the speciﬁcs of the new Pharmaceutical IP Index and its
methodology, it is important to provide a brief overview of existing measurements
and indexes in the ﬁeld of IPRs. That is the purpose of the following section.

1. An overview of existing measurements and indices in the ﬁeld of IPRs

Over the years, there have been numerous studies aimed at assessing or even
measuring the strength of national IP regimes, using quantitative and qualitative
methods of analysis.

Besides elaborating on these studies, it is also important to try to place them in
a wider context, which will also allow us to identify the sources of the strengths and

374

r  r Measuring the Strength of National Pharmaceutical IP Regimes

weaknesses of each study, as well as the index proposed for this project. This should
be done by focusing on three factors:

1. The scope of measurement—which element or elements of IP were explored in

the studies.

2. Sources of data—which type or types of data are used in order to assess and
measure IP strength (surveys, laws, signatories to international treaties, IP
statistics, such as patent applications, etc.).

3. Methodology—the methodological

framework and statistical

techniques

adopted by these studies.

It was not until the late 1980s that the attempts to measure the strength of

national IP regimes across the board became more systematic and serious.

The authors Gadbaw and Richards initiated the ﬁrst study of this type. They
surveyed the national IP environments of seven developing countries (Argentina,
Brazil, India, Mexico, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan) between 1984 and
1998, examining the protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks, semi-conduc-
tors, chip design and trade secrets.5

In addition to analysing the legislative and enforcement activities of the above
countries, the study also examined a wide set of policy factors, such as the approach
of governments to IP protection, external pressures from major trading partners,
political pressures from lobbying groups and the scale of infringement.6

Furthermore, the ﬁrst cross-national comparison of IP protection was provided
by constructing a matrix, in which the x-axis includes the above IP components and
the y-axis includes the seven developing countries.7 The authors ranked the strength
of each country’s protection of the various IP components, using an ascending
ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 5: ‘‘0’’ representing ‘‘serious piratical activities and
no law prohibiting piracy’’ and ‘‘5’’ representing ‘‘protection and enforcement fully
consistent with minimum standards’’.8

The authors found that, between 1984 and 1988, the level of IP protection in the
above developing countries was lower than the minimum IP standards provided by
developed countries.9 More importantly, the seven developing countries vary
signiﬁcantly in their level of IP protection. For example, they found that Taiwan,
South Korea and especially Singapore had a level of IP protection that is nearly
consistent with minimum IP standards proposed by US industry groups (scoring the
values of 3.5, 3.5 and 4.5 on patents, respectively). On the other hand, Argentina,
Brazil and India had a very weak system of IP protection, notably in the ﬁeld of
patents (and pharmaceutical patents in particular)10 in which these countries scored
0 or 1.11 Interestingly, the protection of trade secrets was either very weak or absent
in all of the above countries.12

Notwithstanding the above, the Gadbaw and Richards study is predominantly
descriptive in nature. As it is wide in scope and rich in content (even by today’s
standards), it does not use the above matrix as the key tool for assessing the IP

regimes of developing countries, nor does it attach particular importance to its
methodological construction. Rather, it uses the matrix as a numerical aid for
describing the IP differences between these countries.

In 1990, Rapp and Rozek (RR) constructed the ﬁrst statistic ally-based
cross-country analysis of IP regimes, on the basis of patent laws of 157 countries.13
The perceived strength of national patent protection was based on the recommen-
dations of the US Chamber of Commerce Intellectual Property Task Force dealing
with the minimum standards of patent protection, which include coverage of
inventions, examination procedures, term of protection, transferability of rights,
compulsory licensing and effective enforcement against infringement.14

In terms of its statistical methodology, the RR index is based on a scale of 0–5,

in which the following values are assigned to each country:15

0 5 no patent protection;
1 5 inadequate protection laws; no laws prohibiting piracy;
2 5 seriously ﬂawed laws;
3 5 ﬂaws in laws; some enforcement laws;
4 5 generally good laws;
5 5 protection and enforcement laws fully consistent with the minimum stan-
dards proposed by the US Chamber of Commerce.

Generally speaking, the RR assigns a value of ‘‘5’’ when national laws conform
with the proposed standards of the US Chamber of Commerce and a value of ‘‘0’’
when there are no national laws to protect IPRs.

For example, according to the RR index, countries that score the value of 5
include the US, the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. Countries that
receive a low score, either 1 or 0, include China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Peru,
Turkey and Oman.16 Israel and Singapore scored values of 5 and 4, respectively.
Although considered the ﬁrst statistical measure of IPRs, the primary objective
of the RR study was more ambitious than that. Its aim was to establish a correlation
between IP strength and the level of economic development of a given country.
Hence, the RR index actually focuses on ‘‘predicting’’ the level of IP strength of a
given country on the basis of its state of economic development as measured by the
following variables: per capita gross domestic product (GDP), percentage of
households with electricity, percentage of households with water, presence of social
security system,
infant mortality rate, percentage of workforce in agriculture,
proportion of physicians to total population and being a former British colony.17
The authors found that there is a positive correlation between the state of
economic development and the level of patent protection,
i.e. that developed
countries tend, as a general rule, to have strong patent protection and that under-
developed countries have a very weak system of patent protection. The authors
therefore concluded ‘‘that it is signiﬁcant that the theoretical linkage between efﬁcient
intellectual property protection and economic development is born out of fact’’.18

Despite its innovative approach, the RR index suffers from three major

problems.

First, the RR index is too narrow in scope, as it focuses solely on patents and

essentially equates patent protection with IP protection as a whole.19

Secondly, because by deﬁnition the ordinal measures of the index tend to be
subjective, it is difﬁcult to comprehend accurately the actual differences in the level of
patent protection between, for example, countries with ‘‘inadequate protection laws’’
(the value of 1) and ‘‘seriously ﬂawed laws’’. This is far from straightforward and clear.
Thirdly, the RR index does not take into account de facto enforcement and
implementation of IPRs. In other words, the index measures the strength of IPRs by
focusing on the level of legislation de jure, without attempting to capture the day-to-
day reality of IP protection across nations.

The Ginarte and Park (GP) index of 1997 is probably the most widely used and

the most acceptable standard for measuring cross-national strength of IPRs.20

Building on the approach of Rapp and Rozek, but making it more comprehen-
sive and statistically sophisticated, the GP index focuses solely on the measurement
of IPRs.

The index originally measured the cross-national strength of patent rights in
110 countries for the period 1960–1990, but has since been extended. The index was
coded on the basis of ﬁve categories of patent law:

extent of coverage;

(1)
(2) membership in international patent agreements;
(3) provisions for loss of protection;
(4)
enforcement provisions;
(5) duration of protection.

Although the GP index also ranges from 0 (weakest level of patent protection)
its statistical construction is more

to 5 (highest level of patent protection),
sophisticated than the RR index.

Given the relevancy of the GP index to the proposed new Pharmaceutical IP

Index, it is important to describe brieﬂy the way it is constructed.

Each of the main categories of the GP patent index consists of sub-categories
that describe conditions that either exist or are absent in countries’ patent regimes.21
Each sub-category is therefore treated as a dummy variable, i.e. it is assigned either
the value of 0 or a positive value. It could be 0, 1/3 or 1/7 but not 1. The sub-
categories sum up to 1. All sub-categories are equally weighted.

For example, the category of ‘‘Enforcement’’ has three sub-categories: (1) preli-
minary injunctions; (2) contributory infringement and (3) burden of proof reversal.
Each category is assigned the value of 1—if it exists in the patent regime of a given

country—or the value of 0—if it is absent in the patent regime of a given country.

As all sub-categories have an equal weight,

it follows that the numeric
translation of the above is either 1/3 or 0. This, in turn, means that the category
of ‘‘Enforcement’’ can receive the values 0, 1/3, 2/3 or 1.22

r  r 377

Meir Perez Pugatch

Measuring the Strength of National Pharmaceutical IP Regimes

As to the category of ‘‘Patent Duration’’, the authors have used the term of 20
years as their base line. Countries that provide 20 years or more of protection
receive the value of ‘‘1’’. Countries that provide shorter terms of protection receive
a value that is equal to the term of protection divided by 20.23 The authors also
make a distinction between an application-based system and grant-based system; in
the case of the latter, the term of protection used as a base line is 17 years.

Apart from the fact that the GP index is based on an interval scale, thereby
allowing more accurate comparisons of the differences in the level of patent
protection across countries, the GP index also enables one to track changes in
countries’ patent regimes across time. As originally published, the GP index
measured patent regimes in seven different time lines: 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975,
1980, 1985 and 1990.

For example, according to the GP index, both Singapore and Israel improved
their patent system between1960 and 1990. Singapore increased its score from 2.37
in 1960 and 1970 to 2.57 in 1980 and thereafter. Israel increased its score from 3.05
in 1960 to 3.57 in 1975 and thereafter. The GP index reports that the US increased
its level of patent protection from 3.86 in the 1960s and 1970s to 4.52 in the 1980s
and 1990s.24

Ginarte and Park have also addressed the issue of the index’s sensitivity to
weighting. As mentioned above, the GP index attaches the same weight to all
categories and to all sub-categories. They have therefore conducted sensitivity tests
(Spearman Rand correlations) to observe the extent to which results would change
if different weights are attached to different categories. They found that the levels of
patent protection are not sensitive to the application of equal weighting of
categories (maximum Spearman correlation 40.85) or, in other words, there would
be no signiﬁcant difference in the index should categories be weighted differently.25
In many respects, the GP index has became the common standard in studies
that focus on or relate to the measurement of IPRs. Numerous studies have also
used the GP index to analyse patent changes in the post-TRIP era. For example,
two separate studies by Mahaevanvijaya, and by Park and Wagh have updated the
GP index to cover the years 1995 and 2000.26 According to these studies, the level of
IP patent protection in Singapore increased to 3.91 in 1995 and to 4.05 in 2000.27
The studies found that Israel also increased its level of patent protection, obtaining
the same score of 4.05 in 2000.28

Nevertheless, the GP index is exposed to three primary weaknesses. First, it
focuses only on patents. Secondly, as the GP index is designed to measure the
overall strength of national patent regimes, it does not take into account compo-
nents that are extremely relevant to the pharmaceutical industry, thereby making
the index much less reliable for this industry. This will be discussed in the second
section of this article, Finally, like the RR index, the GP index is ultimately a ‘‘text-
book’’ index, of the existing legal and institutional arrangements, meaning that it
does not attempt to measure the level of effective patent protection as applied in
practice on a daily basis.

Meir Perez Pugatch

All the measurements and indices discussed above are based on a ‘‘textbook’’
approach, i.e. they essentially measure the strength of IP protection by analysing the
legislative level. As mentioned before, this approach lacks the ability to measure the
level of IP protection de facto.29

A second approach for measuring the cross-national strength of IP protection
can be based on surveys. It assumes that a survey-based index would provide a more
accurate and ‘‘on-the ground’’ description of the linkage between the actual level of
IP protection and its effect on companies’ investment and technology transfer
decisions. It is also likely that a survey-based approach would capture aspects of IP
protection that are not recorded ‘‘on the books’’,30 i.e., for example, the difference
between the de jure and de facto protection of IP protection.

The most notable study of this type was developed by Mansﬁeld and Jeong-
Yeon Lee in 1996.31 On the basis of an earlier study by Mansﬁeld (1991), the
authors surveyed 100 US-based companies in six manufacturing industries: chemi-
cals, transportation equipment, electrical equipment, food, metals and machinery.
The companies surveyed by the authors were asked to report on the perceived
level of IP protection in 14 developing countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Hong
Kong, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and Morocco).

Speciﬁcally, the companies were asked to comment on the extent to which the

IP environment in these countries was too weak to allow the following:


transfer the company’s new or most effective technology to a wholly owned
subsidiary in these countries;
to enter into joint ventures that involve the transfer of advanced technologies to
local partners;

 permit the licensing of advanced technologies to local companies.32



The study suggests that companies attach varying importance to the impact of
IP protection in different sectors on their decision to invest in a given country. For
example, investment decisions in the chemical ﬁeld were found to be the most
sensitive to the level of IP protection. More than 60% of the respondents argued
that they would not allow them to transfer their new technologies to wholly owned
subsidiaries in countries with a weak level of IP protection (notably India, Brazil,
Indonesia, Nigeria and Thailand). Similar responses were received with regard to
the other forms of technology transfer.

One of the major strengths of the studies by Jeong-Yeon Lee and Mansﬁeld,
and of Mansﬁeld (1991) is that it provides a realistic description of the impact of IP
protection on the investment decisions of multinational companies. Yet its major
weakness is that it is subjective, in terms of the perceived level of IP protection. It is
also unclear as to which IP components are surveyed in the study.

A 1997 study by Sherwood33 combined the survey-based method with the
author’s consultancy experience on the subject. Sherwood’s index is based on scores
of protection, descending from a maximum of 100 (or 103 given added points) to 0.

r  r 379

Meir Perez Pugatch

Measuring the Strength of National Pharmaceutical IP Regimes

Mostly on the basis of his professional assessment, Sherwood assigned
weights to different protection categories (enforcement 5 25; administration 5 10;
substantive law: copyrights 5 12, patent 5 17, trademarks 5 9, trade secrets 5 15,
patents on life forms 5 6; treaties 5 6; public commitment 5 3). Each category, such
as enforcement, was then further divided into sub-categories.

The model was based on the subtraction of points from each category for any
IP weakness in that category. Overall, Sherwood surveyed 18 developing countries.
Although Sherwood’s model is probably the most insightful and comprehensive in
terms of the actual measurement of cross-national IP regimes, it is still subjective
and based only on the author’s views. This also means that the model cannot be
consistently expanded to other countries, as we lack the author’s knowledge and
criteria for applying the model.

2. Pharmaceutical IP index—proposed methodology

Categories
The proposed model is based on the methodology of the GP index (discussed above)
with one distinct difference. Unlike the GP index, which is based only on patents,
the Pharmaceutical IP Index consists of various forms of pharmaceutical IPRs.
Naturally, the index includes patent protection, but it also considers other protec-
tion elements. For example, the index takes into account IP factors that are
associated with data exclusivity and other sui generis protection, such as orphan
drugs and paediatric drugs.

Statistically, the index measures ﬁve major categories:

term of exclusivity;
scope of exclusivity;
strength of exclusivity;




 barriers to full IP exploitation;


enforcement.

Each category is further divided into sub-categories, according to the following list:
Term of exclusivity:

 basic term of patent protection;
 patent extension term;
 data exclusivity for new drugs;
 data exclusivity for new indications;
 orphan drugs exclusivity;
 paediatric drug exclusivity.

Scope of exclusivity:




380

coverage of pharmaceutical patents (products and processes);
coverage of biotechnology patents;

r  r Measuring the Strength of National Pharmaceutical IP Regimes

Meir Perez Pugatch

 non-disclosure of proprietary test data;
 non-reliance on proprietary test data.

Strength of exclusivity:

restrictions on the use of compulsory licensing;


 prohibiting parallel imports of patented medicines;
 prohibiting commercial testing during the patent term (‘‘Bolar’’).

Barriers to full IP exploitation:

competitive pricing—free pricing without regulatory restrictions of price con-
trols or reference pricing. This category is further developed into three sub-
categories, on the basis of analysis of Kanavos (February 2001):34

–

–
–

absence of requirement of price negotiations as a pre-condition of product
approval,
absence of reference pricing system,
absence of controls on proﬁts;

effective process of patenting—the existence of a post-grant opposition (as
opposed to pre-grant opposition);

 direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs—(DTCA);


free use of brands in packaging (trademarks).





Enforcement:



civil and procedural remedies (injunctions, damages for injuries, destruction of
infringed and counterfeited goods);
criminal procedures, including imprisonment;


 policing actions against piracy and counterfeiting.

Overall, the above index consists of 22 indicators.

Scores
Each category can score values between 0 and 1 and the cumulative score of the
index ranges between 0 and 5.

Similarly to the GP index, each category includes sub-categories of a binary
nature, i.e. each category is assigned either the value of ‘‘0’’—if the particular IP
component does not exist in a given country—or ‘‘1’’—if the particular IP
component does exist in a given country.

The category ‘‘term of exclusivity’’ is calculated numerically. This is done by
dividing the actual term of exclusivity of each sub-category by a standard baseline. For
example, the standard base line of the basic patent term is 20 years. Thus, the numerical
formula for this sub-category is ‘‘n years of basic patent term/20’’. If a country has a
patent term of 20 years the value it scores in this sub-category category equals 1. If it
has less then 20 years of basic patent term, then the value is smaller then 1.

Baseline values are based on the maximum values that can be found in

Weights
Ginarte and Park have demonstrated in their paper that the GP index is not
sensitive to equal weighting (or unweighting) of categories.35 It is therefore assumed
that the categories of this index should have an equal weighting. This assumption is
also logical from an intuitive perspective, given that each category of the proposed
index is essential to the existence of a robust pharmaceutical IP regime.

However, while the principle of equal weighting (or non-weighting) may apply
to principle categories, there is a need to apply weights to the different sub-
categories. This is because some sub-categories are more important than others in
terms of substantial pharmaceutical IP protection. For example, the basic term of
patent protection (20 years) is more important than the patent extension term
(5 years) or the paediatric exclusivity term (0.5 years).

The obvious methodological problem of applying unequal weighting to differ-
ent categories is the risk of making the index more arbitrary. Nevertheless, given the
choice between applying different weights—that are based on arbitrary yet logical
assumptions on the relative importance of different IP components and the
application of equal weights—that are not arbitrary yet illogical—the former
alternative (different weights) is preferable.

It should also be noted that, for the purpose of consistency and coherent
application of weighting to the different subcategories, three weights are applied
according to the following criteria:
 Core component—a component that is fundamental to the existence of a

pharmaceutical IP regime in a given country—weight equals 40% or more.

 Signiﬁcant component—a component that greatly contributes to the level of

pharmaceutical IP regime in a given country—weight equals 20%.

 Added-value component—a component that provides a distinct contribution to
level of pharmaceutical IP regime in a given country—weights range between
5% and 10%.

An application of the proposed index is provided in Annex I. The Pharmaceu-
tical IP Index was used to test the IP strength of four countries for the year 2005: the
US, UK, Singapore and Israel. As previously explained the index ranges between
0 and 5.

r  r 383

Measuring the Strength of National Pharmaceutical IP Regimes

The US pharmaceutical IP environment scores the highest value (4.8), fol-
lowed by the UK (4.59) and Singapore (4.4). Israel’s score (2.9) is substantially lower.
The score of the US is negatively inﬂuenced by the category terms of
exclusivity—in which relatively shorter periods of exclusivity are granted to test
data of new pharmaceutical products and orphan drugs. The US score is also
inﬂuenced by a weakness in the category of strength of exclusivity, which permits
commercial testing during the patent term (so-called Bolar provisions).

The pharmaceutical IP score of the UK is affected mainly in the category of
barriers to full IP exploitation, including barriers to competitive pricing in the form
of controls over proﬁts (pharmaceutical prices regulations scheme—PPRs) and
the absence of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs (DTCA).
A weakness in the category of strength of exclusivity, in which parallel imports
are permitted across the EU, also negatively affects the UK score.

The pharmaceutical IP score of Singapore is affected mainly by the category
of barriers to full IP exploitation—the absence of DTCA—and in the category of
strength of exclusivity—the existence of Bolar provisions.

Compared with that of the above three countries, Israel’s pharmaceutical IP
regime is substantially weaker and reﬂects a weakness in almost all the categories,
with the exception of enforcement.

Interestingly, when comparing the Pharmaceutical IP Index with the most
recent scores of the GP Index, one can ﬁnd some immediate differences, as outlined
in Table 2. One of the explanations for these differences is the fact that the GP index
focuses on the strength of patent protection (but without reference to the speciﬁc
factors relating to pharmaceutical patents such as extension terms), while the
pharmaceutical IP index focuses on pharmaceutical IP elements that extend beyond
patent protection (Table 2).

3. Advantages and weakness of the proposed Pharmaceutical IP Index and
its relation to research projects

First, and most importantly, the new Pharmaceutical IP Index, perhaps for the ﬁrst
time, provides a more sector-speciﬁc tool for the measuring of national pharma-
ceutical IP environments.

Existing IP indices, as surveyed above, tend to focus on the national protection
of IPRs as a whole, without making a distinction between different ﬁelds of

technology. This means that there may be cases in which a weakness in the level of
pharmaceutical IP protection (and, at times, several IP deﬁciencies) is overlooked in
terms of measurement.

The proposed Pharmaceutical IP Index can provide, at least in theory, a more
accurate measuring tool of the level of pharmaceutical IP protection in a given
country.

Secondly, the new Pharmaceutical IP Index expands beyond the measurement
of patents. This is important because, traditionally, pharmaceutical IP protection is
usually associated with patents. However, today, the increasing complexity of the
process of pharmaceutical research and development as well as the challenges facing
the commercialization of pharmaceutical products in different markets, require a
much wider set of IP factors. So far, these factors have not been taken into
consideration in terms of measurements. Therefore, it is important both to identify
these factors and to measure their contribution to the overall level of pharmaceu-
tical IP protection in a given country.

Thirdly, the new Pharmaceutical IP Index may enable both policy makers and
corporate ofﬁcials to compare and evaluate the level of pharmaceutical IP protec-
tion in different countries. Moreover, as the proposed index is numeric by nature (as
it is based on the GP index) it will be best utilized when sampling as many countries
as possible. The ability to compare a large sample of countries is further strength-
ened by the ability to measure the strength of national pharmaceutical IP regimes
over different points of time (this feature is also based on the GP index), thereby
identifying national protection trends.

Fourthly, at a later stage, the proposed index could be adjusted to measure
IP protection in other ﬁelds of technology, such as software, music and ﬁlms,
electronics, etc.

The proposed Pharmaceutical IP Index also has weaknesses.
As noted earlier in the article, the issue of discretionary weighting (although
conﬁned to three groups, as explained above) makes the index more arbitrary,
compared with other indices such as the GP index. As previously explained, the
choice here is between applying an equal weight to each sub-category (which
reduces the risk of discretion but makes the index quite illogical, as some sub-
categories are clearly more important than others) and applying weights that are
based on subjective estimates. Between these two alternatives, the latter seems more
appropriate, yet the risk of discretion remains, in the sense that opinions can vary
about the relative weight of each sub-category.

Also, given that the proposed index breaks new ground with regard to the
protection of pharmaceutical IPRs, it is possible that the 22 indicators above do not
fully represent the entire pharmaceutical IP spectrum. For example, it is clear that
the issue of pricing is far more complex than the three sub-categories that appear in
the index. There are variations as well as combinations of both price controls and
reference pricing. Biotechnology patents can also be divided into sub-categories, as
can the issue of different elements of data exclusivity, the process of patent grant,

etc. It is also possible that there may be other relevant factors that do not appear in
the index.

Nevertheless,

it is also likely that the above indicators provide a fairly
comprehensive picture of the status of pharmaceutical IP protection in a given
country. Naturally, the index can be, and should be, improved in the future.
