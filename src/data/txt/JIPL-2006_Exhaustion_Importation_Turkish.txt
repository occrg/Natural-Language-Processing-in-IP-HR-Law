Exhaustion and parallel importation of
copyright goods under Turkish law
Burcak Yildiz*

In accordance with Annex 8 of Decision 1/95 of the
EC-Turkey Association Council,1 Turkey undertook
to align its domestic intellectual property legislation
with that of the European Communities. Towards
this goal, the Turkish Copyright Act (Fikir ve Sanat
Eserleri Kanunu, FSEK) of 1951 was amended in
1995 and 20012 in conformity with the Council
Directive 92/100 of 19 November 1992 on rental right
and lending right and on certain rights related to
copyright in the Ô¨Åeld of intellectual property.3

The territorial exhaustion rule has been accepted
under Turkish intellectual property law.4 Under
Article 23 of FSEK, by the Ô¨Årst sale or other transfer
of ownership of copies of a work, within the borders
of Turkey, the distribution right of the copyright
owner is exhausted in these copies.5 Hence, on exer-
cising his exclusive right to market copies for the
Ô¨Årst time, the copyright owner cannot restrain the
further sale and distribution of them.

Article 23 also codiÔ¨Åes parallel

importation of
the
copyright goods, granting copyright owners
exclusive right to prevent parallel
importation of
copies of their works which were manufactured and
marketed abroad with their consent.

Key issues
 On account of its geographical location, grow-
ing economy and commercial orientation,
Turkey is an important jurisdiction for intel-
irrespective of
lectual property enforcement
whether
that country enters
the European
Union or remains outside it.

 The introduction of legal rules relating to the
exhaustion of
intellectual property rights in
Turkey, as in other countries, has facilitated
trade in lawfully manufactured products at the
cost of making it more difficult for intellectual
property rights owners to police their rights.

 This article displays

the enforcement of copyright,

the manner in which
current Turkish law on exhaustion of rights
thus
affects
explaining the options available
to rights
owners when seeking to control the sale and
distribution of works in that jurisdiction.

1. Conditions for exhaustion of
the distribution right
Under Turkish intellectual property law, the distribu-
tion right of a copyright owner is exhausted by the
Ô¨Årst ‚Äòsale‚Äô of the copies. In addition, other ways of
transferring ownership of copies (eg donation) also
cause exhaustion. However, acquiring copies from
the copyright owner by rental, lease, loan, or other-
wise does not cause exhaustion, since the ownership
is not transferred.6

According to the minority opinion of Pinar, owing to the provisions of
Ankara Agreement, Additional Protocol and Decision 1/95, Turkey must
be considered within the borders of the European Economic Area and
subject to the regional exhaustion rule applied in this area.

In order to invoke the exhaustion rule, the Ô¨Årst
sale must have occurred ‚Äòwithin national borders‚Äô.7
Another condition is that the Ô¨Årst sale or other transfer
of ownership of copies is to be made by ‚Äòauthorized
persons‚Äô. Beside the copyright owner, those to whom
the copyright owner has transferred the right of distri-
bution or has given consent are within this scope.8

Under Turkish intellectual property law,

the
exhaustion rule only applies to legitimate copies.
Therefore, following the Ô¨Årst sale of unlawfully manu-
factured, pirated, or counterfeit copies, the copyright
owner may halt the distribution of such copies and
take measures, claiming that his exclusive rights
have halt the distribution of such copies and been
infringed (FSEK Article 66 et seq.).9

2. Scope of exhaustion
Once the distribution right over particular copies is
exhausted, the copyright owner may neither halt the
distribution nor impose conditions upon future sales
of those copies. Thus new owners can then freely
trade the copies without interference from the copy-
right owner.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Even where the distribution right
is exhausted, the moral rights remain
with the copyright owner
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Under Turkish intellectual property law, by the Ô¨Årst
sale or other transfer of ownership of the particular
copies within the domestic market, solely ‚Äòthe resale
right‚Äô of the copyright owner is exhausted. Neverthe-
less, the Ô¨Årst sale has no exhaustive effect on other
Ô¨Ånancial rights granted under copyright protection.
The copyright owner reserves the commercial rights
other than the resale right, such as renting, lending,
performance, and reproduction rights, even after the

Ô¨Årst sale.10 Accordingly the copyright owner can
prevent the new owner‚Äôs use of those other commer-
cial rights and also demand additional compensation
from the new owner of the copy who has usurped his
rights.11

Even where the distribution right is exhausted, the
moral rights remain with the copyright owner. In
this way, throughout the distribution process, the
copyright owner can prevent infringements of moral
rights, despite exhaustion.

After the Ô¨Årst sale of ‚Äòparticular copies‚Äô, their resale
does not violate the distribution right.12 After the Ô¨Årst
sale, only the distribution right over the particular
copies involved in that sale is exhausted. In other
words, even after the Ô¨Årst sale of particular copies,
the distribution right of the copyright owner contin-
ues to govern copies that have not yet been manufac-
tured or released into the market.

3. Geographic area to which
the rule of exhaustion applies
The rule of territorial exhaustion13 results in the
distribution right of
the copyright owner being
exhausted solely within the territory of Turkey
following Ô¨Årst sale in the domestic market. The sale
of copies in another country does not however affect
the exclusivity of the distribution right of the copy-
right owner within Turkey. As a result, the copyright
owner can prevent parallel importation of the copies
that were Ô¨Årst sold abroad and restrain their further
sale and distribution.14

Decision 1/95 states that it ‚Äòdoes not imply exhaus-
tion of intellectual property rights applied in trade
relations‚Äô between the parties.15 Thus the rule of
regional exhaustion accepted in the EC is not applic-
able to the importation and exportation of copyright
goods between Turkey and the EC. Accordingly,

Circuit of the Turkish Court of Cassation, 18 March 1999, case 1998/
10225, Decision 1999/2320, 2 Batider 193 et seq. (1999).

9
10 FSEK art 23(2) third sentence clearly states that the rights of renting and
lending are exempt from the scope of exhaustion. This regulation is in
conformity with the art 4 of Council Directive 92/100.

11 Tekinalp, Fikri Mulkiyet Hukuku, 174. The Turkish Court of Cassation held
that, in spite of the first sale, the financial rights of copyright owner other
than the distribution right do not exhaust. In this context, the exhaustion
of the distribution right does not shield infringement of the right to
reproduce the work by the new owner. See the decision of the 11th

on the assumption that the copies of a work which is
protected under FSEK are Ô¨Årst
sold within the
borders of the EC, the distribution right over these
copies exhausts copyright in all its Member States
under the rule of regional exhaustion. In such a
case, since the Ô¨Årst sale did not take place in Turkey,
the distribution right continues to apply for the
domestic market (Turkey).16 Because of this,
the
copyright owner within the borders of Turkey, where
the distribution right is still protected, may prevent
the parallel importation of copies from the EC to
Turkey.

In contrast, once the Ô¨Årst sale of copies occurs in
Turkey,
the distribution right over these copies is
exhausted within Turkey in accordance with the
territorial exhaustion rule, but continues to apply for
the Member States.17 Hence, in such a case, their paral-
lel importation from Turkey to the EC can be prevented
by the copyright owner within the borders of the EC.

4. Parallel importation of copies
Under Turkish intellectual property law the right
to import copies manufactured abroad into Turkey
and then distribute them there is granted only to
the copyright owner.18 Thus importation into the
domestic (Turkish) market, without the consent of the
copyright owner, of copies which were manufactured
and acquired outside Turkey is an infringement of
the exclusive right of distribution.19 In such a case,
the copyright owner is able to prevent the parallel
importation of copies manufactured and marketed
in another country by him or with his consent, claim-
ing that his distribution right has been infringed.

The copyright owner‚Äôs entitlement

to prevent
parallel importation only applies to legitimate copies
manufactured with the copyright owner‚Äôs permission.
In other words, pirate and illegal copies fall outside
the scope of parallel importation and the copyright
owner cannot prevent their importation.20 In such a
case, the importation can only be prohibited by the
provisions dealing with copyright infringement.21

Under the FSEK, the subject matter of parallel
‚Äòmanufactured

importation is codiÔ¨Åed as copies

the rule of

abroad‚Äô.22 However, this limitation contradicts the
fundamental principle of
territorial
exhaustion, which provides that the parallel importa-
tion of copies over which the copyright owner
has distribution right can be prevented. Marketing
that were manufactured in
abroad those copies
Turkey does not exhaust
the distribution right
according to Turkish legislation, since the Ô¨Årst sale
did not take place in Turkey. However, in such a
the copyright owner within Turkey cannot
case,
prevent
importation to the domestic
market, of these copies, over which his distribution
right is still protected, since the copies were not
manufactured abroad.

the parallel

The basic criterion of the rule of territorial exhaus-
tion is thus the location of the copies‚Äô Ô¨Årst sale, not
the location of the imported copies‚Äô manufacture.
Moreover, there is no evidence from the Preamble
of the FSEK that the legislature consciously intended
to limit the scope of parallel importation through
use of the term ‚Äòcopies manufactured abroad‚Äô in place
of
‚Äòcopies, Ô¨Årst sales of which were carried out
abroad‚Äô.

Consequently, taking Turkey‚Äôs territorial exhaus-
tion rule into account, the criterion of the location
of the copies‚Äô Ô¨Årst sale should also be considered
while interpreting this regulation. In other words,
it should be understood23 that the right to prevent
parallel
copies
manufactured abroad and such copies as were
manufactured in Turkey but the Ô¨Årst sales of which
were carried out abroad.
