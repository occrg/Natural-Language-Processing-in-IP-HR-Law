INTRODUCTION 
IPRS AND  GROWTH 

Over the past  fifteen years, substantial changes have occurred in the legal regimes 
in  many developing countries with  respect to intellectual property rights.  Moreover, 
beginning on 1 January 1995, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights, ahnistered by the World Trade Organization, became the standard 
for protecting IPRS in those nations seeking to engage in international trade and enhance 
their  prospects  for  economic  growth.  Countries  that  heretofore  ignored  IPRS 
subsequently adopted laws that at least  provide the basic protection  for innovators as 
outlined  in  TRIPS. This  respect  for  IPRS represents  a  change  in  focus  for  many 
developing countries including Brazil, China, Jordan, Korea, Mexico and Russia. The 
change in basic approach is based, in part, on economic research demonstrating that the 
perceived costs associated with designing, implementing and enforcing a mechanism for 
protecting  IPRS are  low  in  light  of  the  substantial  long-term  benefits  for  certain 
developing countries in terms of increased trade, investment and economic growth.* 

In spite of the positive global developments and experience with protecting IPRS, 
some government officials have either failed to support stronger IPRS or attempted to 
weaken certain TRIPS standards with practices such as  widespread use  of compulsory 
licensing.2 These government officials have been bombarded by misinformation, public 
health  defenders  concerned  that  IPRS inhibit  access  to  health  care,3  and  local 
businessmen reacting to the short-run costs of adapting to a new legal regime. 

Under a compulsory licensing scheme, a government can require an innovator to 
provide third parties with  a licence to use  its technology, often at non-market-based,

Allowing parallel trade is another way of weakening or destroying the benefits of laws protecting IPRS. It is 
sunlcient to note in the present  article that parallel trade is  a major problem for some industries. Parallel trade in 
Pharmaceutical products represents a substantial cost for the research-based  pharmaceutical industry. For the U.K. 
research-based firms, it is currently estimated at approximately US$ 1.2 bdhon annually: SCRIP (2000).

pre-determined  royalty  rates.  By  forcing  innovators  to  license  their  patented 
technologies, the innovators rarely, if ever, realize the market value of the technology. 
The TRIPS Agreement endorses neither broad-based compulsory licensing as an adjunct 
to protecting IPRS nor lscriminatory treatment. As a matter of fact, there are potentially 
harmfd  consequences of imposing compulsory licensing that  are  detrimental to  the 
ability  of a  country  to  develop, and  its  citizens to  access,  health  care.  Compulsory 
licensing is a policy that should be used rarely, if at all. 

B.  ACCESS TO PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS 

Many countries and industries benefit from protecting IPRS. However, the impact 
of stronger IPRS, especially for patents, is  most readily apparent in the pharmaceutical 
industry given the high up-front costs of developing pharmaceutical products, and the 
ease  with  which  commercial  quantities  of products  can  be  produced.  Stuhes  have 
shown that IPRS are particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry. According to 
Mansfield,  strong  patent  protection  is  substantially more  important  to  encouraging 
innovation in the pharmaceutical industry than in the other eleven industries he studied. 
Specifically,  a  majority  of the  innovations in  the pharmaceutical industry would  not 
have been available to consumers in a world without patent protection4 (see Table 1). 
By  encouraging compulsory licensing, a  country perhaps unintentionally reduces the 
incentives for pharmaceutical firms to  conduct  research and development directed at 
creating new,  improved medcines,  and  to  introduce  their  existing products in  that 
country. Compulsory licensing may also create some problems for local governments in 
terms of regulating the quality of licensed products, gathering data on adverse events, 
enforcing product recalls, disseminating information about proper use of products, and 

Mansfield (1986).

ensuring that licensed products are actually available to patients. Contrary to the views 
of the opponents of protecting IPRS, compulsory licensing impedes access to health care 
by reducing the incentives of innovators to invest in developing and disseminating new 
medcines. 

The TRIPS Agreement provides a framework for countries to follow in designing, 
implementing and enforcing mechanisms to protect IPRS. Innovators, consumers and 
governments will  realize  the  benefits  from  implementing the  TRIPS Agreement  if 
countries adopt the TRIPS standards without imposing the additional constraints on the 
innovative pharmaceutical firms of compulsory licensing. There  is  no  demonstrated 
need  to  modifj. or  delay implementing the  TRIPS standards or  treat pharmaceutical 
innovators in a discriminatory manner. If competitive problems arise, targeted remedies 
for the problems consistent with the TRIPS standards should be developed. The local 
pharmaceutical firms in the countries that heretofore have not protected IPRS should 
view TRIPS as  providmg a challenge to explore new strategies and, possibly, expand 
beyond  their national boundaries. If  they  accept the  challenge, they will ultimately 
benefit from the efforts to protect IPRs. 
c.  VALUES  AND MARKETS 

Opposing broad-based  use of compulsory licensing for pharmaceuticals should 
not be viewed as opposing voluntary licensing. Licensing can be an efficient means 
to  transfer  technologes  within  a  legal  system  that  protects  IPRS.  Any  licence 
agreement, however, should be the result of negotiation between a willing licensor 
and a willing licensee. Absent a well-defined competitive problem, no party should 
be  forced  by  a  government  to  enter  a  licence  agreement.  Each  party  should 
participate voluntarily in bargaining over the price of the technology transfer. In the 
pharmaceutical  industry,  there  is  generally  a  competitive  market-place  for 
technology. Innovators have access to multiple candidates for potential licensees who 
can  provide  clinical,  regulatory  and  marketing  expertise  to  commercialize  a 
pharmaceutical  technology.  Licensees,  on  the  other  hand,  can  choose  among 
innovators  offering  alternative  technologies.  They  can  negotiate  to  acquire  the 
technology that has the greatest potential to enhance their competitive positions. A 
pharmaceutical  firm  with  requisite  expertise  can  consider  candidates  across 
therapeutic  categories. Market forces, not regulatory fiat, should determine if, and 
on what terms, an agreement is possible. The role of government is to provide the 
legal framework to negotiate and enforce the resulting contracts, includmg adequate 
antitrust and consumer protection laws. 

Compulsory licensing undermines IPRS for pharmaceutical technologies. There are 
already programmes in place whereby pharmaceutical firms make innovative products 
available to selected developing countries. Thus, there is no need for such constraints,

whch  create  addtional  problems,  especially  with  regard  to  maintaining  quality 
standards for the products produced by licensees. 

This article focuses on assessing the  effects of imposing compulsory licensing on 

pharmaceutical patents. It is organized as follows:

Section 11  explores the facts and fallacies regarding IPRS; 
Section  III  addresses  the  need  for  compulsory licensing  of  pharmaceutical 
patents as a public policy; and 
Section IV summarizes the results. 

11.  FACTS AND  FALLACIES 

Opponents of IPRS express concern that the associated costs of protecting IPRS are 

high. Specifically, they fear four potential adverse consequences of protecting IPRS: 

- 

- 

- 
- 

prices of pharmaceutical products d rise; 
the local pharmaceutical industry will decline; 
patients’ access to health care will be inhibited; and 
investment in the country d not increase.5 

None  of these concerns is  supported by available empirical evidence. We dscuss 

each of these fallacies in detail below and provide the actual facts. 

A. 

IMPACT  O N  PRICES 

A  common  concern  among  countries  considering  protecting 

IPRS  for 
pharmaceutical  technologies  is  that  higher  pharmaceutical  prices  wdl  result.  The 
reasoning is based on the misconception that patent protection provides innovators with 
monopoly  power  that  is  manifested  by  innovators  charging  hgher  prices  for  the 
associated  essential medications.  In  fact,  patent  protection  provides  innovators  with 
exclusivity-not 
a monopoly. That is, the patent grants the innovator the exclusive right 
to make, use, or sell products embodying a well-defined technology for a limited period 
of  time.6 Therapeutic  competition  often  exists  among  patented  and  non-patented 
pharmaceutical products. For  example, there  are  over forty pharmaceutical products 
available  to  treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in the United  States. Even if the 
innovator of a new antihypertensive drug receives patent protection, competition exists 
among  the  alternative  treatments.  The  patent  merely  grants  the  innovator  of  the 

See, for example, ‘t Hoen (2000). 

6  Patent laws in most developed  countries provide patent holders with exclusivity for twenty years from the 

date of filing. 

THE EFFECTS  OF COMPULSORY  LICENSING

hypertensive  product  toehold  entry  into  a  competitive market-place.  Therapeutic 
competition among treatments for hypertension exerts pressure on prices.'  In general, 
sellers ofpatented drugs do not necessarily enjoy monopoly power or the power to raise 
prices. 

Rozek  and  Berkowitz  studed  prices  at  the  manufacturer  level  and  price 
movements  of  the  pharmaceutical products  in  six  therapeutic  categories  for  nine 
countries (four that protected IPRS and five that had not protected IPRS prior to 1996).* 
They found that protecting IPRS does not result in an increase of real or nominal prices 
of existing products.9 Those opposed to protecting IPRS cite drugs that are introduced 
after enacting the law as a concern. Rozek and Berkowitz also found that strengthening 
IPRS had  no  significant  impact  on  prices  of  any  drugs,  includmg  those  products 
introduced  after  IPRS had  been  strengthened  in  countries  with  price  regulation. 
Therapeutic  competition,  the  provision  of  the  actual  laws  protecting  IPRS,  and 
government buying practices, are factors that contribute to the prices of pharmaceutical 
products.  Market  forces  bring  about  an  efficient  outcome.  The  positive  role  of 
government is  to  approve products for marketing in  a  timely  manner to  encourage 
competition  fiom  new,  improved  therapies,  and  to  maintain  competitive markets 
through enforcing the antitrust and consumer protection laws.  In some cases, the laws 
for protecting IPRS will not take effect for several years. Existing products, or products 
about to be launched, in a country may  not be protected by the law. Any  transition 
period  for  a  new  law  to  protect  IPRS should  have  a  well-defined  time-line  for 
implementing the  law. The extent to  which technologies in  the  R&D pipeline  are 
subject to the new law should be determined in a non-discriminatory manner at an early 
stage in the legdative process. 

The extent to which therapeutic competition, regulation, procurement policies, 
and the timing for implementing provisions of the laws for IPRS differ gwes rise to price 
differentials across  counties.10  Charging hfferent  prices  based  on  hfferent  market 
environments across  countries is  an efficient means for pharmaceutical companies to 
recover  the  sunk  costs  of  R&D.11  Using  compulsory licensing as  a  price-control 
mechanism does not necessarily increase welfare in the country. The government will 
have to incur some level of costs for regulatory review of applications for licences and 
quality of products produced by licensees. 

7  Based on a sample of products initially introduced between  1968 and 1995, the length of time for a new, 

patented entrant to compete with the originator has been falling: see Wikerson Group (1995). 

8  Rozek and Berkowitz (1998). Two categories (ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists) contain treatments 

for hypertension.

In a study of the pharmaceutical industry in Italy, Korenko found that pharmaceutical prices increased at a 
slower rate than prices generally after Italy enacted a patent law for pharmaceuhcal products in 1978: see Korenko 
(1 999).

prices of other therapeutic products, costs of production and distribution, taxes and tariffs.

THE  

B.  GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT 

Another concern raised by opponents of IPRs is that protecting IPRS in developing 
countries is likely to cause a decline in the number of local pharmaceutical firms and a 
correspondmg decrease  in  the  overall viability  of  the  local  industry.  Under  a  law 
protecting IPRS, the local pharmaceutical firms will allegedly not be able to survive if 
they have to wait until the patent expires to copy a product afforded protection under 
the law. The real issue is that local firms will have to adjust to the new rules. The patent 
law d stimulate the multinational and local firms to devote more resources to R&D. 
New products d likely emerge from these efforts, providing new opportunities for 
local firms. For example, the United  States has a long hstory of respecting IPRS. The 
generic industry in the United States is  a viable, growing industry consisting of more 
than two hundred producers of generic products. Additionally, the local generic firms 
now have an incentive themselves to devote more resources to R&D as generic firms 
such as Mylan and Duramed have done in the United States, and expand beyond their 
national  boundaries.  The  laws  regarding patent  protection  usually  allow  for  public 
dlsclosure of information when a patent is filed. Thus, the incentive to devote resources 
to  R&D created by  protecting  IPRS  will provide  a  supply  of products for  the  local 
generic industry to imitate once the patents expire. In fact, protecting IPRs may result 
in stronger, innovative local pharmaceutical firms, and ultimately increase employment. 
The local industry may actually be better off as a result of protecting IPRs. 

Following the passage of the patent law covering pharmaceutical products in Italy, 
in  1978, employment  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  grew  faster than  employment 
nationally. In addtion, R&D spending by Italian pharmaceutical firms grew over 300 
percent from 1978 to 1993 in real terms, whereas it had been virtually unchanged in the 
six  years  prior  to  enacting  the  patent  law.12  By  1988,  the  number  of  Itahan 
pharmaceutical firms ranking in the top one hundred pharmaceutical firms world-wide 
increased from zero to seven.’3 Between 1990 and 1996, Brazil and Mexico, countries 
protecting IPRS,  experienced increases in R&D spendmg, while Argentina,14 a laggard 
in protecting IPRS, experienced a  35 percent  decrease, which  was  the  largest  decline 
among countries in Latin America.15 Maskus estimated that in the long run, improving 
IPRS in countries such as  Brazil, China and India wdl produce a  “growth bonus” of as 
much as 0.5 percent per year due to enhanced trade inflows, foreign direct investment 
(FDI) and licensing.16 

Countries that encourage local innovative efforts through protecting IPRS are likely 
to attract more research-oriented jobs and job applicants. Foreign scientists educated in

the United States will return to their home countries where IPRS are protected. In 1980, 
48.9 percent of the South Korean students who received Ph.D. degrees in Science and 
Engmeering at U.S. universities planned to remain in the United States after graduation. 
South Korea improved its protection for IPRS in 1987. By  1990, only 31.6 percent of 
the  South  Korean  Ph.D.  recipients intented  to  stay  in  the  United  States.”  As  the 
National  Science Foundation  acknowledged,  the  trend  in  South  Korea  is  due  to 
improved employment opportunities.’* Similar trends  exist for Taiwan, Mexico and 
Brazil. In contrast, 44 percent of the students fiom Argentina earning Ph.D. degrees in 
Science and Engineering at U.S. universities planned to  stay in the United  States in 
1980, but  64.2  percent of the Argentine students completing their degrees in  1996 
planned to stay in the United States19 (see Table 2). Once scientists begin locating in a 
geographic area,  they  form  a  core  of  intellectual human  capital that  attracts  other 
scientists and investment capital. Growth of the biotechnology industry in the United 
States exhibited t h s  pattern.20 

Canada  experienced  a  269  percent  increase  in  medical  R&D  employment 
following the passage of Bdl C-91, which repealed the earlier legislation providing for 
compulsory  licensing  of  pharmaceutical  patents.  Overall  employment  within  the 
pharmaceutical industry increased 35 percent. In 1998, the pharmaceutical industry in 
Canada provided employment for approximately 20,000 people.21 Brazil upgraded its 
level  of  IPRS  for  pharmaceuticals  in  1996.22 By  1998,  pharmaceutical  companies 
operated  approximately 300  plants  that  generated  50,000  direct jobs  and  250,000

22  On 6 October 1999, the Brazilian M i n i s t r y  of Health issued an Ahnistrative Decree on patents that would 
allow for  compulsory licensing  of products  across  all  sectors in case  of national  emergency or public interest. 
However, this Decree has never been implemented.

THE  

indirect jobs, and generated exports of US$200 million.23 Glaxo and Pfizer are building 
or expandmg production  facilities in Brazil,24  and Pfizer is  shutting down facilities  in 
Argentina, which has not yet implemented a patent law for pharmaceutical products. 
Merck conducted clinical trials for Crixivanm’, a protease inhibitor, in Brazil rather than 
the United  States. A major reason for Merck’s decision to transfer the technology to 
Brazil was its new environment for protecting IPRS. 

Attracting qualified employees to manage a pharmaceutical firm’s growth beyond 
its national boundaries is difficult if the local workers and politicians do not have respect 
for IPRS. One example is  Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical company. In&a has  not 
historically protected IPRS for pharmaceutical products. Ranbaxy had to overcome this 
negative environment in I d a ,  which &scourages investment in pharmaceutical R&D. 
Ranbaxy had  to  seek opportunities to  earn profits  outside of India. It  had  to  sell  its 
products in U.S. and European markets. Ranbaxy established a profitable international 
business that generated over one-half of its revenues of US$250 million in 1996. It was 
able  to consistently invest 4 to 6 percent of its revenues in R&D. Ranbaxy’s road to 
success  took  twenty-five  years.  It  likely would  have  developed faster if  the  Indian 
government protected IPRs.25 Had the environment in India encouraged firms to invest 
in  R&D,  Ranbaxy  could have  developed a  sales base  at home  from which  to  fund 
R&D. It could have found scientists and managers in Inma rather than hire people from 
other  parts  of  the  world.  The  case  study  of  Ranbaxy  illustrates  that  India  has  the 
innovative  resources  to  participate  in  the  international  pharmaceutical  markets. 
However, the environment in India with respect to IPRS does not facihtate developing 
the innovative potential of its local firms. Ranbaxy  grew  more  slowly because  of its 
home country’s policies toward IPRS. 

C.  ACCESS TO MEDICINES 
1.  Access to Essential Drugs 

Access to health care is a major concern for people throughout the world. Even in 
some developed countries, there exist patient populations that may  not have access to 
health  care.  The  problems  of  access  are  often  more  severe  among  the  developing 
countries. The AIDS epidemic is a major factor contributing to the world-wide problem. 
However: “It is incorrect to suggest that access to health care is a problem that should 
be examined solely in terms of pharmaceuticals, especially as is related to the impact of 
the  [TRIPS Agreement] .”26  There  are  other  barriers  primarily  responsible  for  access 
problems. These barriers include: 

-  certain military, social and political conditions;

897 

-  financial hurdles; 
-  physical factors; 
-  damaging economic policies; 
-  information asymmetries; and 
- 

costs and prices of health care goods and services.27 

With  respect  to  pharmaceuticals, representatives of  developing countries and  a 
number  of non-governmental organizations express concern that protecting IPRS  will 
inhibit access to essential pharmaceutical products such as those on the World Health 
Organization’s (WHO’S) Model List  of Essential Drugs. However, only  15 of the 306 
products on the  List,  or less  than  5 percent,  are protected by  patents.28  Compulsory 
licensing  does  not  improve  access  to  these  essential medicines.  Rather,  it  provides 
opportunities for firms pursuing their own economic interests to obtain access to the 
most  profitable  products.  Even  when  essential medicines  are  avadable to  people  in 
developing countries, “the prescribing and consumer use of medcines  [in developing 
countries] is often ineffective, wasteful, or even harmful. Poor quality drugs, includmg 
counterfeit medicines, constitute a continuing health hazard.”29 To illustrate the quality 
problems that  may  exist under  compulsory licences, consider the  following example 
from  another  therapeutic  category,  antibiotics.  Clarithromycin  is  a  broad-spectrum 
antibiotic that is proven to be an  effective treatment for a variety of upper and lower 
respiratory tract  infections. The brand  product  is  sold by  Abbott Laboratories under 
several  brand  names  includmg  KlacidB.  In  a  recent  study  of  forty  versions  of 
clarithromycin fiom Latin America and Asia,  “few generic products met the combined 
criteria of acceptable clarithromycin content, adequate dissolution, and low levels  of 
impurities  that  are  applied  to  the  innovator  product.”30  Thus,  the  copies  of 
clarithromycin stuhes were not equivalent to the brand product. 

There must be a mechanism in place to improve information available to patients 
and to guarantee that high-quality products are sold in a country. Both of these goals are 
achieved by protecting IPRS. The innovator has the incentive to dlstribute information 
to patients, physicians, pharmacists and payers about proper use of its products. If there 
is  protection  for  IPRS,  it  will  encourage  all  firms  to  safeguard their  reputations by 
adhering to good manufacturing practices. The innovator cannot be responsible for the 
quality of the copying firms. Lack of protection of IPRS means other firms can free-ride 
on the investments made by innovators in information and quahty control.

that maintaining quality control for the licensees’ products presents a problem.

THE  

2.  RGD into Local Health Problems 

The TRIPS Agreement does not require that a country’s new product patent laws 
apply  to  products  already being  sold  in  that  country.  TRIPS is  a  fonvard-looking 
approach to IPRS focused on stimulating R&D to create new, improved pharmaceutical 
products. Existing products will s t i l l  be available for firms to copy. However, even the 
firms that survive by  copying products focus on those products that  have  sales levels 
sufficient to justifjr the manufacturing and selling efforts. Developing countries could 
expect  to  receive  more  R&D  on  diseases  specific  to  their  regions  and  more  new 
products generally if they protect IPRS. Lanjouw and Cockburn found evidence that: 
“. . . research related to the treatment  of malaria increased markedly beginning in the mid- 
1980s. Since malaria is a disease specific to countries introducing stronger patent protection, 
and there is no indication that the science somehow became ‘easier’ in this period, it is hard 
to avoid the  conclusion that  the  historical  absence  of  IPRS  played  an  important  role  in 
retarding the development of new treatments for this very important disease.”3l 

There are numerous other dlseases affecting people in developing countries, such as Rtfi 
Valley fever, dracunculiasis, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Afiican trypanosomiasis, Chagas 
disease  (American trypanosomiasis), and AIDS type  C. Protecting  IPRS in  developing 
countries  will  provide  incentives  for  pharmaceutical  firms  to  devote  resources  to 
searching for vaccines to prevent  these dlseases,  or treatments to cure the  diseases  or 
reduce the severity of the symptoms. 

Vaccines  present  a  particularly  troublesome  area  for  research.  Glennerster  and 

Kremer recently pointed out that: 

“After a vaccine has been developed, however,  governments have an incentive to bargain- 
down the price to a level which does not fully cover the R&D costs. Governments are able 
to bargain-down  prices because  they  are  arbiters of intellectual property  rights, vaccine 
regulators, and often the  sole purchasers. Most vaccines sold in developing countries are 
provided for pennies per dose; the newer vaccines, priced at a dollar or two per dose, do 
not reach many of the poorest countries. So potential developers are reluctant to make the 
expensive and risky R&D investments needed to develop new vaccines. Any commitment 
to purchase vaccines, therefore, needs to be sufficiently credible to assure developers that 
governments will not renege once a vaccine has been developed.”32 

This  example  of  vaccines  reflects  the  distortions  created  by  single  buyers  of 
pharmaceutical products.  Such monopsony  buyers  depress the  price  of the  product 
below competitive levels, thus reducing the innovator’s incentives to sell products in a 
country. 

3.  Delays  in Supplying Products 

Innovative  pharmaceutical  firms  d be  reluctant  to  introduce  products  in

THE EFFECTS  OF COMPULSORY LICENSING 

899 

countries with compulsory licensing laws. Such countries will receive new medications 
later  than  countries without  compulsory licensing since innovators do  not  want  to 
create addtional sources of supply of products in a given country that potentially could 
be exported to other countries. Compulsory licensing as a response to differential prices 
is, thus, inefficient and h a d 1  to consumers. Moreover, IPRs are not the sources of 
access  problems  for  health  care  in  developing  countries.  Political,  informational, 
financial, physical, social, or ethnic problems unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry 
inhibit access. For example, providing safe dnnlung water and proper sanitation have a 
greater  impact  on  increasing  life  expectancy  than  spending  on  pharmaceutical 
products.33 

In fact, not protecting IPRS is a likely cause of reduced access to health care because 
of the reluctance of pharmaceutical firms to introduce products in some countries. To 
determine  whether  protecting  IPRS  has  an effect  on  when  a  country  receives  a 
pharmaceutical product, consider the first reported sales of six drugs (Prozac@, Losec@, 
Norvasc@, Unasyn@, Inhibase@ and  Axid@) in  nine  countries.  Prior  to  1996, four 
countries (Korea, Mexico, Taiwan and Hungary) protected IPRS, while the five other 
countries (Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey) did not protect I P R s . ~ ~  Each of 
the six products was initially sold in at least one of the nine countries after June 1985. 
Korea, the first country in the sample to protect IPRS,  received four of the six drugs 
studied either first or second among the nine countries. More dramatic, two products, 
Axid@ and Unasyn@, were not even introduced in three of the five countries that did 
not protect IPRs for pharmaceuticals. These products were initially launched in Korea 
in March 1990 and June  1988, respectively. This analysis shows that it is not protecting 
IPRS that  limits access  to  medcines.  Lack  of respect  for  IPRS actually creates access 
problems (see Table 3). 

D.  CHANGES IN INVESTMENT 

Opponents of protecting IPRs  claim that  domestic investment will not increase. 
They claim that multinational firms will merely transfer the additional profits earned as 
a result of the improved environment for IPRs to their home countries, depriving local 
governments of tax revenues and local communities of investment spending. In fact, 
protecting IPRS  is  a  prerequisite for  foreign direct investment  (FDI). As  Dalton  and 
Serapio state: 

“Protection  of  intellectual  property  remains  the  major  concern  for  most  companies 
contemplating the location of their R&D facilities in emerging markets such as China and 
Russia. Other concerns include a weak research infrastructure,  economic turbulence, and 
political instability in some of the emerging rnarkets.’’35 

33  Rozek and T d y  (1999). 
34  These are the same countries analysed by Rozek and Berkowitz (1998). Brazil eventually protected IPFU 
35  Dalton and Serapio (1999). p. 44.

THE EFFECTS  OF COMPULSORY LICENSING 

901 

Protecting IPRS  appears to be a necessary, but not the only, condition for FDI in a 

country. Mansfield concluded that: 

“The strength or weakness of a country’s system of intellectual property protection seems to 
have  a  substantial  effect,  particularly  in  high-technology  industries,  on  the  kinds  of 
technology transferred by many U.S. firms to that country.”36 
Countries with weak protection for IPRS get older technologies. Moreover, there 
is  a  statistically significant negative  relationship  between  U.S.  direct  investment  in 
countries between 1989-1992 and the perceived weakness of their intellectual property 
laws.  Mansfield  found  a  ten-point  increase  in  perceived  weakness  of  intellectual 
property laws is associated with a US$ 200 million a year decrease in U.S. investment 
in manufacturing.37 More recently, Xu and Chiang found a statistically significant result 
“that weak patent protection  may be one major impediment in LDCS fjess-developed 
countries] to international technology diffusion.”3* Compulsory licensing is  associated 
with a weakening of protection of IPRs. 

The recent experience of Brazil is evidence of the importance of IPRs. After Brazil 
protected IPRS for pharmaceuticals in 1996, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism 
predicted that investment in the pharmaceutical and chemicals sector would grow to 
US$600 million by  1999.39 In fact, foreign pharmaceutical companies announced over 
US$  1.2 billion  in  new  investments,  including  research  facihties  by  April  1997.40 
Neighbouring  countries  such  as  Argentina,  which  have  lagged  behind  Brazil  in 
protecting IPRS are losing investments. Increased political stabihty and anticipation of 
the  new  patent  laws,  that  would  put  Argentina  in  compliance  with  the  TRIPS 
Agreement, may  help  to  restore  the  incentive for  pharmaceutical firms to  invest in 
Argentina.41 Argentina delayed its obligations under  TRIPS fiom its original 1 January 
2000.date. Argentina must avoid further set backs in its schedule to protect IPRS  to avoid 
further loss of investment spendmg by multinational firms.42 

Canada benefited from a substantial increase in investment by pharmaceutical firms 
after it  passed  Bill  C-22  in  1987, which  was  the  first  of two  legislative actions that 
repealed Canada’s compulsory licensing provisions for pharmaceutical patents. In fact, 
R&D in the industry doubled in three of the five years between  1993 and 1998, as it 
increased from CDN$ 28 million to CDN$ 900 million (see Table 4). 

Using three  different measures of investment by pharmaceutical firms, Pazderka 
found  that  for  each  measure,  pharmaceutical  R&D in  Canada  increased  after  it 
eliminated  compulsory  licensing  for  pharmaceuticals.  Specifically, R&D  by  firms

42  Currently, there are challenges within the WTO for both Argentina and Brazil regarding IPRS. There are 

issues with implementing IYR regimes that must be resolved.

monitored by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board increased their R&D as a 
percentage of sales in Canada fiom 6.1 percent in 1988 to 11.5 percent by  1997; R&D 
by pharmaceutical firms as a percentage of all manufacturing R&D increased from 4.5 
percent in 1975 to 10.4 percent in 1997; and the share of R&D spending by U.S. firms 
for pharmaceutical research rose from 7.3 percent in 1982 to 10.0 percent by  1989.43 
Additional  evidence that  protecting  IPRS  stimulates local R&D  efforts is  in  the 
number  of  U.S.  patents  innovators from  a  country  obtain.  U.S.  patent  activity by 
innovators from a given country is a  measure  of the  ability of that country  to create 
world-class  R&D. The number  of U.S.  patent filings generally rises  when  a  country 
protects IPRS, suggesting the emergence of local innovative activity. For example, South 
Korea improved its  IPRS  in  1987. Prior  to  that  time,  the  number  of patents Korean 
innovators obtained in the United States was very low. Since 1987, the number of U.S. 
patents obtained by Korean innovators has exhibited exponential growth (see Table 5). 
While patents may  grant temporary exclusivity, they are pro-competitive in the long- 
run because patents require public dsclosure of information.44 Addtional R&D will be 
stimulated fiom the increased knowledge available as a result of the disclosure, which 
may also explain the greater number 0fU.S. patents obtained by Korean innovators afier 
Korea protected IPRS. The number of patent filings for countries without IPRS remains 
uniformly low. Patents fded in the U.S. by innovators from Argentina, Egypt, Turkey 
and Jordan, countries that do not yet adequately protect IPRS, is virtually 2~0.45 

111.  COMPULSORY LICENSING AS  PUBLIC POLICY 

The h a d  effects of compulsory licensing are well known. In  1980, Douglas H. 
Ginsburg stated that “the investment-inhibiting effect of the hture possibility of having to

license patents to competitors may prove to be quite substantial . . .”46  Ginsberg also noted 
that there is no basis for presuming that the social cost of lost opportunities for innovation 
is less than the social cost of the exclusivity provided by IPRS. More recently, U.S.  Patent 
and  Trademark  Office  representative  Lois  Boland  stated  that  “compulsory  licensing 
diminishes  the  exclusivity  of  the  patent  grant  and  undermines  the  incentive  for  the 
innovation  and  investment  that  is  a  critical  component  of  technological  progess.”47 
Compulsory licensing for pharmaceutical patents WLU  undermine the  incentives to find 
treatments for unmet medlcal needs and, thus, prolong the sdering of those a c t e d  with 
these problems.  Consider the  consequences of  such  a  view.  ADS is  a  disease  that  was 
unknown in the 1970s. If  compulsory licensing had been used as a policy tool in the United 
States, it is urhkely that many of the treatments avadable today would have been developed. 

A.  TRIPS ARTICLES 27.1, 30 AND 31 

The TRIPS Agreement addresses exceptions to the exclusive right conveyed by a 
patent in Article 30, and compulsory licensing in Articles 27.1 and 31. Article 30 lists 
three condltions for exceptions to exclusive patent rights described in Article 28. The 
three conditions are: 

-  limited exceptional use; 
-  the exceptional use may not conflict in an unreasonable manner with normal 

practice of the patent; and

-  the  legitimate  interests  of  the  patent  holder  may  not  be  unreasonably 

prejudiced by exception.48 

Article 27.1 provides that  “patients shall be  available and patent rights enjoyable 
without  dlscrimination as  to place or invention,  the field of technology and whether 
products are imported  or locally produced.”49 Article 27.1 specifically focuses on the 
compulsory licensing policies such as those that existed in Canada and New Zealand that 
applied  to  pharmaceutical  technologies.  Article  31  addresses  “Other  Use  Without 
Authorization of the Right Holder”.50 Compulsory or involuntary licences fall into the 
category  of  “use  without  authorization”.  Article  31  seeks  limits  on  the  use  of 
compulsory licences;51 and it identifies the provisions that must be respected-including 
efforts to  negotiate with  the  patent  owner,  payment  of adequate compensation, and 
judicial re~iew.5~ The limits on use generally fall into four categories: 
national emergency or other conditions of extreme urgency; 

- 

-  public non-commercial use; 
- 

possible remedy for anti-competitive practices; and 

-  dependent patents.53 
In sum, compulsory licensing is to be considered under limited conditions. It is not 

intended as a general component for a system that protects IPRS. 

Proposals to  require broad-based  compulsory licensing as  a  general feature  of a 
system for protecting IPRS misinterpret the TRIPS Agreement. The message contained 
in  Articles  27.1  and  31  is  that  specific  limitations  and  conditions  on  the  use  of 
compulsory  licensing  should  be  followed.  For  a  country  adhering  to  the  TRIPS 
Agreement, the government must define the situations that constitute extreme urgency 
and  public  non-commercial  use  explicitly to  prevent  firms  from  circumventing the 
intent of the law. In the case of the other two exceptions, a comprehensive competitive 
analysis is required. The presumption that the patent grants exclusivity, not necessarily 
monopoly or market power, should be maintained. For a given patent, there must be a 
two-stage screening process to identifj.: 

-  whether  anti-competitive  acts  are  actually or potentially  associated  with  a 

patent; and

patents with  considerable economic sigmficance compared  to  the first  patent.  The owner of the first  patent  is 
entitled to a cross-licence  of the dependent patent, and rights to the first patent are non-assignable except with  the 
assignment of the dependent patent.

- 

whether compulsory licensing is an effective remedy. 

Competition  authorities  should  follow  a  case-by-case  approach  in  assessing 
competitive  effects  and  remedies.  In  the  situation  of  a  dependent  patent  for  a 
pharmaceutical product,  there  must  be  an  objective  review  of the  data provided  in 
support of a claim that there is considerable economic significance associated with the 
claimed dependent patent.  Without this rule-of-reason  approach, it is possible that a 
government could require compulsory licensing when, in fact, no problem exists. 

B.  COMPETITION 

POLICY 

An  issue that  countries  adopting  standards for  protecting  IPRS must  consider  is 
whether  they have antitrust laws and infiastructures to identify and solve competitive 
problems.  The  antitrust  laws  should  specify  the  standards for  assessing  competitive 
behaviour.  For  example,  the  Department  of  Justice  @OJ)  and  Federal  Trade 
Commission  (FTc)  Horizontal  Merger  Guidelines  in  the  United  States  contain  a 
methodology  for  conducting  a  competitive  analysis  generally.54  The  standards  are 
explicit and widely known. With respect to IPRS, the U.S.  antitrust authorities further 
acknowledge that laws protecting IPRS: 

“. . . provide  incentives  for  innovation and  its  dissemination  and  commercialization by 
establishing enforceable property rights for the creaton  of new and useful products, more 
efficient processes, and original works of expression.”55 

Although, IPRS confer: 

“. . . the power to exclude with respect to the specific product, process, or work in question, 
there will often be sufficient actual or potential close substitutes for such product, process, 
or work to prevent the exercise of market power.”56 
A situation in which the IPRS (e.g. patents) enable the innovator to exercise market 

power that is: 

“. . . solely ‘a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident’ does 
not violate the antitrust laws [in the United States].”57 
For pharmaceutical products, the market-place in most countries generally appears 
to be effectively competitive. Prices of products do not rise after the country enacts laws 
for  protecting  IPRS. In  four  countries  that  recently  protected  IPRS (Korea, Mexico, 
Taiwan and Hungary), sufficient choices appear to exist across six therapeutic categories. 
Using  data  on  the  number  of  products  available  in  six  therapeutic  categories

antagonists  and  ACE  inhibitors-broad

there are six or more molecules available in each category58 (see Table 6). 
c.  ANTITRUST MATTERS WITH LICENSING AS  A REMEDY 

In spite of a lack of theoretical and empirical support that problems emerge after a 
country protects IPRS, opponents claim that compulsory licensing should be a required 
feature of the associated intellectual property regime. These opponents of IPRs cite that 
licensing  remedies  have  an  established  foundation  in  the  United  States  and  other 
developed countries.59 However, this is an oversimplification of the facts. In the United 
States, licensing is a rarely used tool to remedy specific anti-competitive practices. While 
the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged that licensing is an available remedy when 
patent  abuses  are  involved in  antitrust cases,  there  are  only  a  few  situations where 
licensing has actually been ordered.60 Comprehensive antitrust review is done on a case- 
by-case  or rule-of-reason  basis. Balto and Mongoven note that:

THE EFFECTS OF COMPULSORY LICENSING 

907 

“The FTC has  always  been  concerned  with  licensing  as  a  remedy.  It  is  by  nature  more 
regulatory than divestiture and may require continued oversight to ensure effectiveness.”61 
Licensing  as  a  remedy  is  invoked  in  circumstances  where  public  welfare  is 

threatened by a merger or other specific business practice. 

In  1975, Xerox  Corporation  and the  FTC entered into  a  consent agreement in 
which  Xerox  agreed  to  make  available for  licensing its  copying machine patents  at 
royalty rates not to exceed 1.5 percent of the licensee’s copier sales. The consent settled 
the FTC’S concerns about three possible anti-competitive problems relating to Xerox’s 
activities with  respect to plain paper  copiers:  “it price-discriminated, priced far  from 
costs, and patented every imaginable feature of the copier technology.”62 The FTC &d 
not find patenting alone sufficient basis for requiring licensing as  a  remedy, rather the 
collection of three activities created competitive concerns. In another matter, an  FTC 
Adrmnistrative  Law  Judge  initially  ordered  compulsory  licensing  of  Bordon’s 
ReaLemonO  trademark,  which  was  “an  unprecedented  remedy”.63  However,  the 
remedy was actually removed on appeal of the decision to the full Commission. These 
two examples confirm that licensing as an antitrust remedy is rarely used. The mere fact 
that  a  company  has  patents  or  trademarks  is  insufficient  by  itself  to  conclude  that 
licensing is necessary.  There must be evidence of anti-competitive effects before even 
considering possible remedies. 

Another  antitrust  area  where  the  DOJ or  FTC may  consider  licensing  is  in 
connection with  the review of mergers. However, the prospective merger candidates 
can  avoid licensing or sale  of technology by  withdrawing the  merger  proposal.  For 
example,  Ciba-Geigy  Ltd.  and  Sandoz merged  to  form Novartis in  1997. The FTC 
identified five  gene-therapy  products that  would  be  affected  by  the  merger.  In  the 
market for overall gene therapy, the FTC felt that the Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz combined 
entity would possess all of the essential intellectual property to introduce gene therapies. 
Its leadership was  such that it would have been difficult  in the FTC’S view for another 
firm to enter the market. To complete the transaction, Novartis agreed to grant non- 
exclusive  licences  of  specific  patented  intellectual  property  essential  to  developing 
general  and  specific  gene-therapy  pr0ducts.~4 This  relief  was  a  rare  case.  The  FTC 
perceived a competitive problem existed. The parties agreed to license the technology 
to complete the transaction. They could have chosen to abandon the transaction rather 
than license the technology.

compulsory licensing are: Roche Holding Ltd.  and  Corange Limited,  C-3809  (25  February  1998). and Baxter 
International  Inc.  and Immunex International,  123 F.T.C.  904 (24 March  1997). In both  of these  matters, the 
licensing remedies were directed at solving specified competitive problems. The FTC undertook a rule-of-reason 
analysis in each case prior to seeking relief  The fact that licensing was a remedy in these isolated cases is not a signal 
that public policy should change to grant unrestricted licences. 

908 

THE JOURNAL O F  WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Merger investigations in which licensing is a remedy are rare. In  1998 and 1999, 
U.S.  antitrust  authorities  received  filings  for  4,728  and  4,679  merger  transactions 
through the Hart-Scott-Rodino  process, respectively. Only 1.8 and 1.6 percent of those 
transactions were challenged in  1998 and 1999, respectively.65 Based on data for 1998, 
the antitrust agencies obtained a consent order in about 40 percent of the transactions 
they  challenged,  which  represents  obtaining  relief, not  necessarily  licensing, in  0.7 
percent of the merger transactions reported66  (see Table 7). In the  context of merger 
policy, licensing can be used as a remedy. The U.S. Antitrust authorities may negotiate 
with  prospective  merger  partners  that  a  condition  of  approving the  merger  is  that 
specific technologies must be licensed to an approved entity. The merger partners are 
not required to provide open access to the technology. They can propose a single buyer. 
They are not even required to enter a licence agreement. They may choose to litigate 
with  the  government on whether  the merger violates the antitrust laws or they may 
abandon the merger.67 The European Commission has also imposed licensing rememes 
as a conmtion for approving a merger. In January 1996, the Commission approved the 
Kimberley-Clark/Scott Paper merger after imposing conhtions that include licensing 
the Kleenex@ name for bathroom tissue and lutchen towels for up to ten years.68 

Many times the courts have upheld the rights of innovators to control use of their 
proprietary technologies and not to license them out to competitors. In February 2000, 
the U.S.  Court of Appeals  for the  Federal  Circuit  upheld the  right  of Xerox not  to 
license its patented copier parts or any of the intellectual property to competitors. The 
Court did not find any evidence that Xerox had obtained its patents unlawfully or used 
them  to  unlawfully  extend  any  monopoly  power.  Absent  any  unlawfil  behaviour, 
Xerox  had  no  obligation  to  license its property.69  In  1998, a  similar conclusion was 
reached in  the case  of  Technical Resource  Services Inc. v.  Dornier Medical  Systems,  in  the 
market for lithotripters, a medical  device that breaks up  kidney stones.70 The United 
States recognizes that IPRS are essential to innovation.

THE EFFECTS OF COMPULSORY  LICENSING 

909 

D.  FAILED ATTEMPTS TO USE COMPULSORY LICENSING 

In  theory,  compulsory licensing is  an  inefficient policy since  it  undermines  the 
incentive to conduct R&D and tends to undervalue technology by replacing voluntary 
negotiation  over licensing with forced sales of technologies. Harold Varmus, Director 
of the National Institute of Health, recently wrote that: 

“Undermining licensed intellectual property rights  [from the government to private sector 
licensees]  would,  I  believe,  unnecessarily jeopardize  the  development  of  important 
therapeutic drugs.”71 
In practice, compulsory licensing was a failure in Canada. R&D spending slowly 
declined  following  the  implementation  of  compulsory  licensing.  Since  compulsory 
licensing was  removed  from public policy, R&D spendmg has  grown, and access  to 
drugs has improved.72 Compulsory licensing was  extremely damaging to the Canadian 
pharmaceutical  industry,  as  well.  Due  to  the  lack  of  R&D  because  of  compulsory 
licensing,  Canada  was  unable  to  produce  any  world-wide  or  innovative  drugs. 
Compulsory licensing rendered Canada unable to compete in the global pharmaceutical 
market .73 

Experience  in  Canada  also  suggests that  compulsory  licensing failed to  control 
pharmaceutical prices. Between  1982 and 1987, when compulsory licensing existed in 
Canada,  Canadian pharmaceutical prices  increased an  average of 9 percent  per  year, 
whch  was  3.4  percentage  points  higher  than  the  average  annual  increases  in  the 
Canadian  consumer  price  index  for  the  same years.  Moreover,  this  average  annual 
increase was 1.9 percent higher than the corresponding increase in U.S. pharmaceutical 
prices over the same period.74 

The Canahan  experience  suggests that  compulsory licensing has  been  harmful. 
IPRS  create long-term  investment  opportunities  for countries that  will  be  foregone  if 
compulsory licensing exists. If unlawful monopoly power of pharmaceutical firms in a 
particular  product-market  is  the  concern,  countries  should  expend  resources  on 
improving and enforcing antitrust laws emphasizing a rule-of-reason  approach. 

The Eastman Commission observed that prices of pharmaceuticals are affected to a 

greater extent by policies other than compulsory licensing: 

“Government policies on administering prices, establishing selective or negative lists as the 
basis for determining eligibility for reimbursement, and  coverage of the population  with 
pharmicare  plans  may  well  be  at  least  as  important  as,  if  not  more  important  than, 
adjustments to the Patent Act with provisions such as compulsory li~ensing.’”~ 
As discussed above, Canada benefited in terms of increased R&D investment after

it repealed its compulsory licensing law. Local firms such as Apotex have also been able 
to grow. 

E.  LICENSING BETWEEN WILLING PARTNERS PROMOTES EFFICIENCY 

Licensing of pharmaceutical  technologies  is an important tool for firms to manage 
their intellectual property when it is the outcome of arm’s-length  negotiation between 
a willing licensor and licensee.76 In the United States, it is  acknowledged  that d i n g  
intellectual  property  licensing  is  usually  pro-competitive  because  it  allows  firms  to 
transfer technology  efficiently. Even  “the  [U.S.]  antitrust  enforcement  agencies have 
indicated  that  they  will  exercise their  enforcement  discretion to limit the  potentially 
chilbng effect on pro-competitive  licensing arrangements  . . .”77  Likewise, the Canadian 
government  accepts that “licensing is pro-competitive  because it facilitates the broader 
use of a valuable IP right by addltional parties.”78 It is often advantageous for firms to 
negotiate  licences and is a natural occurrence in markets.79  By forcing licensing on an 
innovator, they are put at a bargaining disadvantage, which results in the undervaluing 
of technologies  and destroys their incentive to create new, improved products.  In fact, 
the  US.  antitrust  authorities  encourage  licensing  and  perceive  its  pro-competitive 
benefits when it is the result of voluntary negotiation between willing parties. The U.S. 
licensing guidelines state that: 

“[U.S. antitrust regulatory Agencies] do not presume that intellectual property creates market 
power  in  the  antitrust  context;  and  the  Agencies  recognize  that  intellectual property 
licensing allows firms to  combine complementary factors of production and  is  generally 
pro-competitive.”80 
U.S. antitrust authorities also recognize that: 
“ ... any  tangible  or  intangible asset  that  enables  its  owner  to  obtain  significant  supra- 
competitive profits, market power (or even a monopoly) that is solely the ‘consequence of 
a  superior product, business  acumen,  or  historic accident’ does not  ... impose  on  the 
intellectual property owner an obligation to license the use of that property to others.”sl 
Compulsory licensing does not improve access to health care and, in fact, makes it 
more  dlfficult for  consumers  to gain  access to pharmaceutical  products.  Compulsory 
licensing forces innovators to relinquish their technologies  and destroys their incentives 
to  conduct  R&D.  Consumers  suffer  because  they  are  denied  access  to  the  new, 
improved medicines that would have been discovered and developed as a result of R&D 
conducted by pharmaceutical  firms. Compulsory licensing makes companies  reluctant 
to introduce their products in countries, and further inhibits access to pharmaceuticals. 
Studies  have  also  found  that  compulsory  licensing  reduces  the  ratio  of informative

advertising to persuasive advertising,*2 which makes it more difficult for consumers and 
doctors to access proper information about health care. 

Compulsory  licensing  is  unnecessary  to  prevent  monopoly  power,  given  that 
therapeutic  and  eventual generic  competition  exist in  a  market.  It  inhibits  access  to 
health  care  and  creates  addtional  costs  for  a  country. Designing,  implementing and 
enforcing a compulsory licensing policy is inefficient and costly. 

F.  AIDS IN AFRICA 

Compulsory licensing is currently a policy under review as a means of improving 
access to health care for people in Afiica suffering with AIDS. Some people have claimed 
that the TRIPS Agreement permits products to be copied in emergencies and “the Aids 
epidemic is such an emergency.”83 While the problem of stopping the spread of AIDS 
and treating those currently afflicted should receive world-wide attention, compulsory 
licensing  is  not  the  solution.There  are  a  number  of  questions  that  proponents  of 
compulsory licensing to alleviate the AIDS problem in Africa have not addressed. These 
questions for medicines to treat AIDS as well as other widespread diseases include: 

-  Who would actually license the AIDS technologies? Will the government end 

up as a pharmaceutical manufacturer? 
Would the licensees have the abihty to produce the complex products? 

- 
- 

- 

- 

- 
- 

- 

At what price would the resulting products be sold in Africa? 
Will firms license and produce the drugs at prices that do not provide a “fair” 
return or a return lower than they can receive by producing other products to 
sell outside Africa? 

Who  would  monitor  the  quahty  of  the  products  produced  under  the 
compulsory licence? 
Who will approve the products produced under a licence as safe and effective? 
Who would educate the physicians, other health care providers and patients 
about uses of AIDS drugs? 
How does the government guarantee that the products purchased under the 
compulsory licence will remain in Africa and not be supplied to higher-priced 
markets? 

-  Who will pay for the drugs? 

82  McFetendge (1998). 
83  McNeil (2000). 

912 

THE  

-  Who will provide the  other  equipment and materials, such as blood testing 

equipment and reagents? 

Five research-based pharmaceutical firms (Glaxo Wellcome, Merck, Bristol-Myers 

Squibb, Roche,  and Boehringer Ingelheim) and five international agencies (UNAIDS, 
WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and the  United  Nations Population  Fund) signed a 
joint statement of intent aimed at “accelerating access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment 
in developing countries.”84 Such programmes are a more effective way of getting high- 
quality products to patients. The innovative companies are proviQng  the  product  as 
well as the product support. Another industry-sponsored programme for addressing the 
AIDS epidemic is the Botswana Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership, a collaborative 
programme involving the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Merck, and the Republic 
of Botswana.85 

Pharmaceutical firms are often willing to provide memcines at no cost in specific 
situations. Pfizer  recently  offered  to  give  away  Diflucanm,  a  drug  to  treat  a  brain 
infection  prevalent  in  HIV patients,  to  South  Afi-ica.  Glaxo  already  gives  AZT to 
Pfizer and Glaxo did not need the threat of compulsory licensing to provide 
U N I C E F . ~ ~  
South Africans with life-saving medicines at no cost. 

G.  ALTERNATIVES 

Frequently used  compulsory licensing  deprives the  innovator  of the  exclusivity 
conveyed by a patent. It discourages future innovation and creates numerous problems 
for health care access. It undermines any r e p e  for protecting IPRS. In fact, the AIDS 
crisis  in  Afiica  or  other  health  care  problems  in  the  developing  world,  such  as 
tuberculosis and malaria, will have a  greater possibility of being solved by protecting 
IPRS. Stimulating innovation to discover and develop medicines for these diseases is the 
most  effective  solution.  The  local  scientific  infrastructure  already  exists  in  some 
developing  countries,  such  as  Argentina  and  India,  to  create  partnerships  with 
innovators from the  developed  countries that  will fachtate finding solutions to these 
health problems. Protecting IPRS wdl encourage such co-operation. 

In the short-run,  however, alternatives to compulsory licensing could and should 
be  developed  to improve  the  flow of existing treatments for AIDS to the  associated 
populations in the developing countries. The most direct, cost-effective way to obtain 
relief for these health care problems is for the research-based  pharmaceutical firms to 
co-operate  with  governments  and  international  agencies  in  preferential  access  and

Specifically, the Malarone  Donation Program  is  a partnership between  The Task  Force for Child Survival and 
Development and Glaxo Wellcome.

donation programmes. The research-based  firms already have products to treat some 
of  the  diseases  that  are  prevalent  in  the  developing  countries.  They  have  the 
manufacturing  capability with  appropriate  quality-control  standards in  place.  Most 
importantly,  they  have  the  ability  to  disseminate  the  information  to  health  care 
providers and patients on the particular disease and the proper treatment of the disease. 
Many of the major research-based  pharmaceutical firms are currently participating in 
preferential access and donation programmes for treating or preventing diseases such as 
HIV/AIDS, malaria, sleeping sickness, vitamin A deficiency, trachona, river blindness, 
leprosy, lymphatic fdariasis, leishmaniosis and cholera.87 

The  fundamental  issue  remains  that  for  many  diseases  affecting  people  in 
developing countries, cures do not exist88 or existing treatments for the symptoms of the 
hseases  do  not  yet  exist.  To  encourage  pharmaceutical  firms  to  engage  in  R&D 
activities directed  at  finding  or  improving  the  medcines  for  addressing the  health 
problems  of developing countries, protecting  IPRS is  an  essential component  of any 
public  policy  directed at  improving health  care  world-wide.  Without  adequate IPR 
regimes in place in the developing countries, there is  no incentive to devote resources 
to  the  R&D required  to  create  cures  or  improved  treatments for  specific  diseases. 
Progress on improving the medicines available to treat diseases common to developing 
countries requires systems to be in place to protect the rights of the innovators. Success 
in discovering, developing and dsseminating pharmaceutical products is most likely to 
be achieved through the private sector. Government fundmg of research is often helpful 
in the basic research area. However, government agencies are likely to be ineffective in 
the commercial aspects of drug development. 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

The general problems raised  by  opponents of protecting IPRS  for pharmaceutical 
products  consistent  with  the  TRIPS Agreement  are  largely  unfounded.  Upon  close 
scrutiny, the  alleged  problems  are  largely  non-existent;  specifically, prices  will  not 
increase, unemployment in the local pharmaceutical industry will not necessarily  rise, 
firms wdl have greater incentives to invest in countries that protect IPRS, and protecting 
IPRS will not inhibit access to health care. The costs of protecting IPRS appear to be low, 
while the associated benefits for developed and developing countries are substantial. 

A broad-based  compulsory licensing policy for pharmaceuticals will not  achieve 
the benefits of IPRS as envisioned in TRIPS. Since protecting IPRS does  not necessarily 
provide  pharmaceutical  companies  with  monopoly  power  and  no  other  inherent 
problems arise from protecting IPRS, imposing a prophylactic condition in the form of 

European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (2000). 

87  For a description of the firms participating in the various donation programmes and the firms involved, see 
88 The fact that existing anti-retroviral drugs are not a cure for AIDS prompted Namibia and three other African 

nations not to accept an offer of US$ 1 billion in loans to purchase these drugs: see Shangula (2000).

compulsory licensing will actually inhibit economic growth and access to health care. 
Most importantly, compulsory licensing has h a d l  effects for countries in the form of 
inhibiting access to current pharmaceuticals, &scouraging spending on R&D to create 
the  products  for  unmet  m e d d  needs,  reducing  a  country’s prospects  to  engage in 
international trade, and delaying the long-run benefits of economic growth. 

Compulsory  licensing  destroys  the  incentive  for  an  innovator  to  introduce 
medcines  in  a  country  and  inhibits  local  firms  fiom  developing  their  innovative 
capabilities. Moreover, it will not improve access to pharmaceutical technologies and 
health care. Compulsory licensing actually harms consumers and local firms. Alternative 
policies that  are more  likely to be successful  are to  encourage preferential access and 
donation programmes whle providing  assurances  against  parallel  trade.  Vigourously 
enforcing antitrust and consumer protection laws, while encouraging local firms to form 
voluntary alliances with the innovative pharmaceutical firms, is likely a more productive 
use  of  a  country’s  resources  than  imposing  broad-based  compulsory  licensing 
requirements.
