Visually impaired persons (VIP) have asked the international
community to help end the “book famine” they face and
increase the number of books available in accessible formats.
After 30 years of negotiations, meetings and consultation
between member states delegates, negotiators and non-
profit organizations, the World Intellectual Property Orga-
nization (WIPO) adopted the VIP Treaty on 27 June 2013 in
Marrakesh, Morocco, which entered into force on 30
September 2016. Until today,
it is mostly developing
countries that have ratified the Treaty and only the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) embraced its principles among the Gulf
States. This article studies the copyright system in the Arab
Gulf States and examines the state's readiness for the
adoption of the Treaty. It argues that without considering
the cultural and legal implications that influence disability
and visual impairment in these states ratifying the Marrakesh
Treaty and amending copyright laws in the Gulf States will
not alleviate the “book famine” for VIPs in these countries.
This article proposes legal and policy recommendations to
promote and facilitate accessibility to published works for
VIPs that can be adopted in the Arab Gulf States and other
developing countries.

INTRODUCTION

| 179

Despite advances in digital technologies and the Internet that humans have witnessed in the twenty-first century,
millions of people worldwide are still denied access to published works (LaBarre, 2014). According to the latest survey
prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO), 285 million people worldwide are estimated to be visually
impaired of which 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision (World Health Organization (WHO), 2014).
About 90% of the world's population with visual impairment live in developing and least-developing countries (LDCs),
and only around 5% of published works are available in accessible friendly formats (such as Braille, audio and large
print) (Group of Specialists on Human Rights in the Information Society, 2008; McClanahan, 2012; Williams, 2012). In
the Arab world alone, it is estimated that there are about 35 million blind people living in the Arab region (Alyam, 2010;
Calvo, 2014, World Health Organization (WHO), 2012), but the number is not definite as there is no reliable data
(United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), 2014), on the size and causes of visual
impairment (Al Thani, 2006).

Access to knowledge and information is a basic human right and has become an essential component for full
participation in society (Accessible Book Consortium; Kaminski & Yanisky-Ravid, 2014). It is a prerequisite for
achieving full human development potential as it opens the door to education, employment, good health, and social
and political participation (Conway, 2015, p. 37). The international community is struggling with the lack of access to
books that hinders global efforts toward inclusivity and equality between all nations and people (United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), 2015, p. vii). For developing countries, access to books is critical to redress inequality
in society and to achieve social and economic development.

Nowadays, we live in a wireless, touch-screen, online world where technology is constantly evolving. Visually
impaired persons (VIPs) have tremendous means and ways never experienced before to access an unlimited number
of published works with the aid of new technologies that include Braille translators, DAISY, screen readers, speech
synthesizers, Kindle-style Braille, Apple iPad and other adaptive devices and technologies (Bertlesman, 2012, Center
for Disability Law and Policy (CDLP), 2012).

As the majority of published works that are produced today are “born digital” and accessible (Fruchterman, 2013),
it is remarkably easy to distribute these works via modern Internet communication networks to anyone anywhere at
virtually no marginal cost (Cameron, Wood & Suzor, 2014). Unfortunately, despite the advances in digital
technologies, VIPs are still challenged to gain access to published works and are faced with various technical,
commercial and legal barriers (Bertlesman, 2012, p. 42).

The availability of published works is not enough for VIPs who also need to obtain accessible format copies to use
for reading and development. The process of converting existing published works into accessible formats is typically
expensive and time-consuming and that is why non-profit organizations and charities worldwide try to provide more
accessible materials for VIPs, but unfortunately, the number of these works is considered small and their distribution is
limited (Calvo, 2014; Gahleitner, 2013).

Publishers and rights holders refuse to license copyrighted materials or to make them in accessible formats
because they view the market for VIPs as economically unprofitable (Fitzpatrick, 2014; CDLP). In the face of increased
unauthorized distribution of copyrighted works, they have employed various means such as technological protection
measures (TPMs), encryption, and rights management information (RMI) to protect and preserve it (Fitzpatrick, 2014,
p. 153). This ultimately has a lasting effect on accessibility and has led many commentators to bleakly describe the
crisis in terms of access to books for VIPs as “the Book Famine for the Blind” (Helfer, Land, Okediji, & Reichman, 2017,
p. xxi; Hely, 2010, p. 1398).

One of the main reasons that inhibit VIPs from accessing works, including books, journals and other published
works is mainly copyright laws that differ from one country to another, allowing in some countries translation rights,
but prohibiting the creation, distribution and sharing of accessible format copies through any communication medium
including the Internet (Sganga, 2015, p.88). Many international copyright laws are unclear in relation to the importing
and exporting of accessible copies from one country to another, which could trigger at least, in theory, copyright

infringement liability (Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL), 2015; NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation, and
Employment (MBIE), 2015). As a result, copyright law has emerged as one of the forceful means of regulating ideas
and knowledge-based products in the digital age by prohibiting the free flow of information rather than facilitating
knowledge sharing and distribution.

VIPs and non-profit organizations supporting them began thinking of a treaty for the blind in the 1980s (Nelson,
2013), but it was only on 27 June 2013 that the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) adopted a new
treaty in Marrakesh, Morocco for the blind and print disabled. The Treaty is formerly known as “Marrakesh Treaty to
Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled”
(“Marrakesh Treaty or Treaty”).1

The Marrakesh Treaty is an international agreement on copyright limitations and exceptions that aim to facilitate
the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies of books and other print materials for VIPs, without requiring
prior consent from copyright holders, and regardless of countries’ copyright laws (Gahleitner, 2013; Gesit, 2013;
Guarini, 2013; Helfer et al., 2017, p. 91; MBIE, 2015; Nelson, 2013; World Blind Union (WBU), 2013; Zemer & Gaon,
2015, p. 838). The Treaty forms a significant landmark in reaching international consensus on designing limitations and
exceptions to authors’ rights (Helfer et al., 2017, p. xxiii). For developing countries, it is particularly useful because it
requires the amendment or enactment of new copyright laws for the benefit of VIPs.2

There are an increasing number of studies that deal with copyright law and the accessibility of VIPs to published
works (Conway, 2015; Hapur & Suzor, 2013; Helfer et al., 2017; Hely, 2010; Kaminski & Yanisky-Ravid, 2014; Li &
Selvadurai 2014; Scheinwald, 2012; Trimble, 2014; Vezzoso, 2014; Williams, 2012; Zemer & Gaon, 2015), but
unfortunately, these studies do not examine closely the cultural implications that affect the implementation of the
Marrakesh Treaty. In the Gulf States, in particular, copyright scholars have not examined the subject of VIPs, copyright
and access to published works (Al Fawzan, 2009; Eeed, 2001; Khater, 2008; Loutfi, 2012).

The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, it studies the cultural challenges that influence the adoption of the
Marrakesh Treaty in developing countries, and particularly the Arab Gulf States. Second, it examines the current
copyright regimes in the Gulf States and discusses the extent to which they can be amended for the benefit of VIPs.
The article is divided into ten sections. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the main provisions of the WIPO's
Marrakesh Treaty and discusses its aims in relation to VIPs and international copyright law. Section 3 studies the
relationship between culture, disability and intellectual property in the Gulf States. Section 4 examines the availability
of published works in an accessible format in the Arabic language for VIPs. Sections 5 and 6 deal with the effectiveness
of disability legislations in the Gulf States, and the ratification in the Gulf States of the major international human rights
treaties mainly the United Nation Convention of the Rights of People with Disabilities (CPRD) 2006. Section 7 gives an
overview of the legal and author's rights systems in the Gulf States. It also examines the exceptions to VIPs and
technological protection measures (TPMs) under the copyright laws of the Gulf States. Section 8 examines the
exceptions for disabled people in the French Intellectual Property Code (IPC) and its adoption in the copyright laws of
the Gulf States. Finally, section 9 provides legal and policy recommendations to rethink disability rights and visual
impairment in the Gulf States. This section is divided into two sub-sections. Section 9.1 will consider the legal
recommendations for the implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty, and finally, Section 9.2 will discuss the policy
recommendations to promote the interests of visually impaired communities in the Gulf States. Sections 1 and 10
provide the introduction and conclusion.

2 | THE MARRAKESH VIPS TREATY

The early draft version of the Marrakesh treaty was formally introduced in May 2009 by Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay
(Scheinwald, 2012, p. 472), but it was only in December 2012 that member states and international organizations
agreed to discuss a specific treaty containing limitations and exceptions for VIPs at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference3
(Bertlesman, 2012, pp. 43–46; Brown & Waelde, 2015; Brown, Waelde, & Harmo, 2012, p. 928; Conway, 2015, pp.

41–43; Ficsor, 2013; Helfer et al., 2017, p. xvii; Hely, 2010, pp. 1393–1395; Vezzoso, 2014, pp. 806–807). Despite
disagreement over the provisions of the treaty, the representatives and negotiators managed to leave their
differences behind4 (Brown & Waelde, 2015, pp. 577–602; Brown et al., 2012, p. 928; Kaminski & Yanisky-Ravid,
2014, pp. 262–263), and the WIPO adopted the Treaty on 27 June 2013 in Marrakesh, Morocco, which later entered
into force on 30 September 20165 (WIPO, Marrakesh Treaty 2013 WIPO Notification No. 21, 2016).

2.1 | The treaty in a nutshell

The final version of the Marrakesh Treaty is short comprising of 22 articles and a preamble (Marrakesh Treaty, 2013,
Preamble). The Treaty starts by acknowledging its relationship with other international intellectual property and
copyright treaties mainly the Berne Convention, the TRIPS Agreement and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT).6

Article 2 defines the three key important terms of the Treaty, and these include “works”, “accessible format copy”

and “authorized entities”7 (Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 21–38).

The central provision of the Marrakesh Treaty is Article 4(1)(a) which imposes on the contracting parties the
obligation to provide works in accessible format copies in favor of beneficiary persons (also authorized entities), and also
allows making any necessary changes to the work for that effect.8 This is achieved by having a limitation and exception in
the copyright law to the rights of reproduction, distribution, making available to the public and public performance9 (such
as the right
(EIFL, 2015, p. 9; Helfer et al., 2017, pp.
38–43; Li & Selvadurai, 2014, p. 658; Vezzoso, 2014, p. 802–813). Several conditions need to be satisfied for this
to occur. First, there should a lawful access to the work. Second, the access should be for the sole purpose of converting it
to an accessible format copy. Third, the accessible format copy should be distributed and made available by the
authorized entity for the exclusive use of the beneficiary person and, fourth it should be provided only for non-
commercial purposes.10 The Treaty bestows on the contracting parties’ broad discretions in implementing its provisions
based on their own legal systems and practices, provided they comply with the three-step test available under the Berne
Convention and other international treaties11 (Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 67–74; Vezzoso, 2014, pp. 796–820).

The Marrakesh Treaty does not contain any mandatory reference to either the “commercial availability” or
remuneration or a payment of a fee to authors and copyright holders but leaves the matter to be determined by the
member states. These two provisions are considered permissive and it is left for each state to adopt them (Helfer et al.,
2017, pp. 47–51).12

Another unique and mandatory provision in the Marrakesh Treaty is the cross-border exchange system. Article 5
(1) of the Treaty requires a contracting party to permit an authorized entity to send (export) an accessible format copy
made under an exception to an authorized entity or a beneficiary person in another destination country13 (EIFL, 2015;
Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 53–55; Li, 2014, p. 766; Schonwetter, Kouletakis, & Wiele, 2015). There are three important
requirements built into the provision: First, both the exporting country (source) and the importing country
(destination) must be parties to the Marrakesh Treaty. Second, the accessible format copies must be “made under a
limitation or exception or pursuant to operation of law”. Third, the distribution must occur “by one authorized entity to
a beneficiary person or an authorized entity”.14 Article 6 of the Treaty matches Article 5 in requiring contracting
parties to allow authorized entities or beneficiary persons to receive (import) accessible format copies from another
authorized entity or beneficiary located in other countries.15 In addition, Article 7 of the Treaty provides that a TPM,
such as a copy or access control, cannot prevent beneficiary persons from enjoying the exceptions provided under the
Treaty, even when a country prohibits the circumvention of TPMs in its copyright legislation16 (Attorney-General's
Department (AGD), 2015; EIFL, 2015; Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 62–67; Hilty et al., 2015, p. 9; Sganga, 2015, p. 100;
Wiele, 2014, p. 50). Article 9 of the Treaty encourages contracting parties to share information, practices and policies
in relation to authorized entities (including information related to the cross-border exchange of accessible format
copies) with interested parties and members of the public as appropriate.17 Finally, the Treaty has also other important
provisions in relation to the international bureau, eligibility, rights and obligations, signature, entry into-force,
effective date, denunciation, language and depository.18

2.2 | The high expectations of the treaty for VIPs

The Marrakesh Treaty is the first international intellectual property treaty with clear humanitarian and social development
goals. This is because it allows blind and the print disabled to access books and other published works (Helfer et al., 2017, p. 91;
Fruchterman, 2013; MBIE, 2015, p. 25) by lowering the transaction costs that are associated with the making and supplying of
copies of copyrighted works for VIPs for whom visual perception of works is impossible or extremely difficult (Trimble, 2014, p.
772). The Treaty intends to mitigate the global problem of the “book famine”19 for blind and VIPs worldwide, and at the same
time tries to reduce copyright piracy (CDLP; Helfer et al., 2017, p. xxi; Hilty et al., 2015; Jarvis, 2015; Scheinwald, 2012; WBU,
2013; Zemer & Gaon, 2015, p. 848). The adoption of the Treaty also ends a troubled historical period of international copyright
relations that lasted for more than a decade (Fiscor, 2013a; LaBarre, 2014). This is because previous international IP treaties
such as the WCT and the WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) have dealt particularly with the strengthening and
enforcement of copyright, rather than dealing with limitations and exceptions to copyright.

The Treaty intends to prevent copyright law from further constituting an insurmountable obstacle to the
production and dissemination of works in accessible formats (Conway, 2015; p. 41; Hilty et al., 2015). It specifically
addresses the needs of visually impaired communities by discussing, for the first-time copyright, human rights and
disability together in a meaningful way (Brown & Waelde, 2015, pp. 577–602; Helfer et al., 2017, p. xxiii, 8).

With the Marrakesh Treaty, it is possible to see a shift in the culture of the WIPO, such that the international
institution is not only focused on enhancing enforcement regimes but is now being moved to expressly consider global
public interests, including the fundamental rights to have equal access to knowledge and information and other
development goals (Conway, 2015, p. 57; Trimble, 2014, p. 770). For that purpose, the Treaty is important because it
offers an important launching pad to bolster attention to Access to Knowledge (A2K) and the WIPO Development
Agenda within developing countries and LDCs (Kapczynski, p. 806; Okediji, 2008, pp. 137–161; Olwan 2013, pp.
268–269; Roffe & Vea, 2008 pp. 79–110; Williams, 2012, p. 1073; Yu, 2009, pp. 515–522).

The Treaty forms a significant legal landmark in the quest to establish uniform criteria for copyright exceptions
and limitations and the promotion of international cooperation to facilitate access to knowledge for people with print
disability (Li & Selvadurai, 2014, pp. 663–664). It is particularly important for the international community because it is
the first time that an international agreement has been reached between various parties representing different
perspectives who came together to negotiate and sign a limitation and exception treaty for VIPs (Australian Digital
Alliance (ADA), 2014; Fiscor, 2013a, p. 82; Zemer & Gaon, 2015, p. 847). This has a far-reaching practical implication
for the ability of the international community to meet, improve and challenge prevalent conceptions about what
intellectual property and copyright laws ought to be (Trimble, 2014, pp. 768–795). As Professor Justine Hughes
explains, “the Marrakesh Treaty—and the process by which it was achieved—are important because they show that it
is possible to overcome extremely polarized IP perspectives when negotiating IP treaties” (Hughes, 2013).

For developing countries, the Marrakesh Treaty for VIPs is also very important. First, the majority of developing
countries do not have specific copyright provisions for the benefit of VIPs (Sullivan, 2006, pp. 108–109), and the
Treaty is clear on requiring national law amendments for that purpose. Second, the majority of VIPs in developing
countries may not be able to obtain accessible format copies of copyrighted works ordinarily (Yun, 2012, p. 440), and
they need the assistance of developed countries that may not have any desire to provide appropriate accessible
copies (Scheinwald, 2012, p. 475). Third, VIPs in developing countries and domestic organizations of disabled people
exert lower levels of influence on the reform of domestic copyright legislations, as compared to better-resourced
copyright owners and holders (Kaminski & Yanisky-Ravid, 2014, p. 290; Yun, 2012).

3 | CULTURE, DISABILITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE GULF STATES

To appreciate the challenges related to the implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty in the Gulf States, it is important
to understand the region's local context, in particular the relationship between culture, disability and intellectual
property protection.

OLWAN

| 183

Culture can be defined as “the total way of life of people” or “the whole complex of traditional behavior which has
been developed by the human race that is successively learned by each generation” (Creetz, 1973; Sunder 2001, p.
498). It includes the set of attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviors shared by a group of people (Rubin & Menzer, 2010).
Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions (Mitra, Posarac &
Vick, 2011). The Gulf States still understand disability as a medical or pathological condition that needs to be cured,
and not as a social condition that should be dealt with properly by society.20 Unfortunately, there is no accurate and
reliable data on the number of disabled people in the Gulf States, and without such data, there can be no appropriate
services or programs and no proper response to their particular needs (Al Thani, 2006; ESCWA, 2014, p. 7). It is
important to learn about cultures and how it affects individuals’ attitudes toward people with disability since this is a
prerequisite to understanding their situations and conditions in society (Al Ahmadi, 2014, pp. 28–30).

Arab countries are not considered a homogeneous group and there are differences that exist among them in
terms of economy, social values, politics and geography (Al Thani, 2006). In the Gulf States, in particular, cultural
factors such as family, tradition, ethnicity and religion present additional barriers for people with disabilities to
participate and function normally in society and economic life (Mitra et al., 2011; Thomas & Thomas, 1998).

The Gulf States are not individualistic, but rather family and community oriented, it is believed that people should
take care of their own children rather than delegate that responsibility to the government. Unfortunately, persons
with intellectual, developmental or psychosocial disabilities are considered a source of shame and a financial burden
for many families (Al Thani, 2006). It is also perceived in society that disabled people are lacking the ability to live
independently and to participate and be included in the community on an equal basis with others. There is also a lack of
awareness for persons with a disability about their rights and the services available to them (United Nations,
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disability, 2016).

Disability has a negative impact in relation to women as it creates more challenges in their daily life (Nagata, 2003).
Although the status of disabled women generally in the Gulf States varies from one country to another, it is common
for them to be marginalized in society (Nagata, 2003). This can happen by keeping disabled women at home or
educating them in special schools removed from the public eye, which greatly reduces both the public acceptance of
their limitations and their employment opportunities (Weber, 2012).

The Gulf States are multicultural which is not surprising as these states import a large amount of labor from other
countries. For example, in states like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the share of expatriates in the
population runs as high as 80–90%, but with somewhat lower shares in other GCC countries such as Saudi Arabia (The
World Bank, 2010, p.3).

Many ethnic groups are living in the Gulf, and these include, but are not limited to Arabs, Iranians, Africans,
Indians, Filipinos and many more. Families with disabled children who are working in the Gulf States will have different
opinions about disability, independence and health. They might have fewer personal and family resources, have less
knowledge and understanding of externally available resources, as well as higher unemployment (NARIC, 2010).

As for religion, Islam sees disability as morally neutral. It is neither a blessing nor a curse and it should be accepted
as being an inevitable part of the human condition, and a fact that has to be addressed properly by society (Al Thani,
2006). Islamic principles do not discriminate against people with disabilities; rather, Islam encourages Muslims to
provide the best care to those who have special needs. For families with disabled children, they need to accept their
destiny and be grateful to God who has specific foresight in creating people with disabilities (Al Ahmadi, 2014, pp. 28–
30). Unfortunately, there is a contradiction between the Islamic philosophy toward disability and the cultural attitudes
that exist in the Gulf States as many people with disabilities are facing difficult types of negative attitudes, and they do
not have equal access to education, jobs and social life (Al Ahmadi, 2014, pp. 28–30).

The United Nations (UN) describes the Arab region generally as lagging behind the rest of the world, as disabled
people are invisible, marginalized and more isolated than other people, because of negative social attitudes and the
lack of a human rights culture (Reinl, 2008). The Gulf States (more broadly Arab countries) are struggling with the
challenges associated with disability (WHO, 2012, p. 6).21 For these reasons, they are trying to raise public awareness
about the causes and prevention of disability, and the rights and potentials of persons with disabilities, passing

184 |

OLWAN

legislation, supporting organizations for persons with disabilities, and creating an accessible physical environment to
buildings and other facilities that are used by the public (barrier free environment) (Al Thani, 2006; ESCAWA, p. 10).
It is important to consider the relationship between law and culture. Laws need to change and adapt accordingly

based on the local conditions and developments occurring in society.

In relation to intellectual property, the Gulf States have complied with their international obligation under the
TRIPS Agreement by enacting various intellectual property laws that contain the basic required protection for patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and industrial designs.22 Bahrain and Oman signed a Free Trade Agreement
(FTA) with the United States and as a result, they have adopted a higher level of protection for intellectual property.
Although the Gulf States have legislation that protects intellectual property, there are concerns by developed
countries particularly the United States that the level of enforcement of those laws is inadequate and insufficient. This
is the position of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) that criticized these laws, and their application in
practice on a number of occasions.23

The Gulf States adopt a traditional view towards intellectual property, as do many other developing countries,
that it is an essential tool to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and promote economic growth and development
(Drahos, 2002, p. 779; Drahos, 2003, pp.14–15; Okediji, 1996, p. 331; Olwan, 2013, pp. 211–212; Reichman, 2009,
pp. 1117–1118). This view is short-sighted, while it might be true that intellectual property is important for business,
but it cannot alone bring economic development and efficiency.

Unfortunately, Intellectual property laws in the Gulf States have not been amended to accommodate the interests
of disabled persons. This is because intellectual property and particularly copyright is not understood as a way to
affect the ability of disabled persons to learn, think, share and borrow ideas, and develop emotionally and
economically (Sunders, 2012, pp. 1–2). It is critically important for the Gulf States to understand intellectual property
not only from an economic perspective but also from a broader cultural and social perspective. With the exception of
Kuwait, Gulf copyright laws do not mention VIPs and do not offer them any “safe harbor” protection for making and
distributing accessible format copies, such as Braille, audio, or digital format (Johnson, 2010). It is important for the
Gulf States to understand intellectual property as a way to affect human capabilities and be able to live a good and
joyful life (Sunder, 2006, p. 285; Sunder, 2012, pp. 1–16). The exact situation of copyright laws in the Gulf States will
be discussed in detail in section 7.

4 | THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLISHED WORKS IN ARABIC

Unfortunately, the number of books and published works that are available for VIPs in an accessible format is limited in
the Arab world. Many blind and VIPs have mentioned the fact that they are suffering from a shortage of books (Al
Bayan, 2016). There are also few businesses and non-profit organizations in the market that are involved in the
practice of converting books to accessible formats in the Arab world.24

There are also no reliable figures on the production of Arabic books in the region, but many indicators suggest a
severe shortage of writings and a large share of the market consists of religious books and educational publications
that are limited in their creative content, much less compared to other fields such as science and the arts (Rogan, 2004;
UNDP Arab Human Development Report, 2003; Ursula, 2016). In addition, the publishing industry in the Arab world
faces well-known challenges such as high illiteracy levels, low income of potential readers, a lack of distribution
networks, the dearth of bookstores and public libraries, censorship and piracy25 (Al Jabry, 2015; Buchmesse, 2014;
Rogan, 2004; UNDP, 2003; Ursula, 2016).

As for digital publishing, it is still in its infancy across the region, and the majority of people still prefer reading
printed books (Kulesz, 2010; Shahbandari, 2015). According to a study prepared by the Wamda Research Lab in
partnership with Google in 2015, only 41.5% of the Arab world population (estimated 375 million), use of the Internet
and Digital Arabic Content (DAC) online stands at 3% of global content since 2015 with a significant gap in online
content in both quality and quantity (Knight, 2015).

OLWAN

Recently, there have been many initiatives and new projects to promote books and increase publishing and reading
habits in the Arab world (Al Jabry, 2015). For example, the Emirate of Dubai recently launched a 100-million-dirham fund
(more than US $27 million) called the National Endowment for Reading, which aims to increase early-childhood reading,
lifelong reading and support local publishers. The UAE has also announced plans to build “the biggest library in the Arab
world” (Ursula). On a final note, it is important to give more attention to the subject of book production and the
availability of books in the Arab world not only to benefit VIPs but also sighted people because there are real challenges
faced by the publishing industry that have to be addressed properly by society (UNDP, 2003, p. 74–84).

5 | THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISABILITY LAWS IN THE GULF STATES

The Gulf States have enacted specific laws to protect the rights of people with disabilities. These laws provide equal
rights and opportunities for people with special needs in education, health, training and rehabilitation. In Qatar, there
is the Law in Relation to People with Disability,26 and in the Sultanate of Oman the Law for Disabled People.27 In Bahrain,
the Law on the Welfare, Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities.28 In Kuwait, the Law for the Rights of
People with Disabilities,29 and in Saudi Arabia, the Law for Disability and Care for Disabled People.30 Finally, the UAE has
the Federal Law in Relation to the Rights of People with Disabilities and Special Needs.31

Many organizations are working to advance the disability rights of VIPs in the Gulf States. In Qatar, for example,
there are specialized organizations, such as the Qatar Social and Cultural Center for the Blind, and the Qatar Assistive
Technology Center (MADA).32 In the UAE, there is the Sharjah City for Humanitarian Services (SCHS),33 Zayed Higher
Organization for Humanitarian Care and Special Needs34 and Tamkeen,35 Al Thiqah Club for Handicapped36 and the
Emirates Association of the Visually Impaired.37 In Saudi Arabia, there is Ebsar Foundation,38 and in Bahrain, the
Saudi-Bahraini Institute for the Blind.39 Finally, in Kuwait, there is the Kuwait Association for the Blind, a nonprofit
organization that provides various services for VIPs including supplying books in Braille and audio formats.

For the proper implementation of any legislation in the Gulf States, it is important for social and cultural attitudes
to be supportive. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the actual legislation of the Gulf States for persons with
disabilities and the social and cultural attitudes toward VIPs in society. Another important comment to make is that the
Gulf States focus on removing barriers to the physical environment (street, public buildings and transport) for VIPs
(disabled people more generally), rather than access to cultural works. It is extremely important to give particular
attention to increasing the number of accessible copies of published works (e.g. Braille, large print, audio recording,
and audio-visual and digital-compatible formats) to support the educational needs and development goals of VIPs.

6 | THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS
TREATIES IN THE GULF STATES

There are three important international human rights treaties focused on disability and these include the International
Covenant on Economic and Social Culture Rights 1996 (ICESCR),40 the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights 199641 (ICCPR),42 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 200643 (CPRD) (Brown &
Waelde, 2015, pp. 577–602; Brown et al., 2012, p. 928). There are also other international treaties that cover
disability rights and these include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1946 (UDHR),44 the Convention against
Discrimination in Education 1960 (CDE)45 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 (CRC).46

The International Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD)47 is a United Nations human rights
treaty that was adopted on 13 December 2006 to provide basic rights in relation to disability. The CRPD is regarded as
the foundational international human rights treaty for disabled people and VIPs for various reasons (UNDP, 2003, pp.
94–96). First, it treats VIPs as a category of persons with disabilities and provides more detailed rights compared to
previous treaties particularly in relation to the right to access information.48 Second, it imposes an obligation on states
to ensure that people with disabilities can take part in cultural life on an equal basis with others.49 Finally, and more

186 |

importantly, it requires states to make sure that intellectual property rights (IPRs) do not impose unreasonable or
discriminatory barriers to access to cultural materials50 (Brown et al., 2012, p. 915, 928; Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 16-19;
Scheinwald, 2012, p. 460; UNDP, 2003, pp. 10–11, 94-96; Yun, 2012, p. 469).

The Gulf States that have ratified the CPRD include Saudi Arabia (accession on 24 June 2008); Qatar (accession
on 13 May 2008); Oman (accession on 6 January 2009); UAE (accession on 19 March 2010); Bahrain (accession on 22
September 2011); and Kuwait (accession on 22 August 2013).51 Saudi Arabia is the only country among the Gulf
States that has ratified the CPRD's Optional Protocol on 24 June 200852 that allows individuals and groups to
complain regarding breaches of the CPRD provisions by State parties. Saudi Arabia is also the only Gulf State that is a
member of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) until 31 December 2020.53 The Gulf States
are also members of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC),54 and several of those states
are members of the Convention against Discrimination in Education (CDE).55

The rationale for the ratification of international human rights treaties in the Gulf States are diverse and can be
either internationally or domestic. International motives include being a good citizen of the international system,
integration into the international community, and “being the first at everything”. Among the domestic motives is that
ratification is considered a good policy tool for domestic change in the country and for empowering progressive
government agencies against more traditional or conservative groups (Çalı & Ghanea, 2013, pp. 8–9).

Unfortunately, the Gulf States that are members of the CRPD Treaty have not complied with their general
obligations under the treaty. In particular, they have not created copyright limitations and exceptions for VIPs in
accordance with Article 30(3) of the Treaty.

The UAE is the only country among the Gulf States that have adhered to the Marrakesh Treaty. On 15 October
2014, the UAE Government deposited its instrument of accession to the Treaty at the WIPO headquarters (Emirates
News Agency, 2014).56 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD) welcomed the UAE
accession to the Marrakesh Treaty in 2014.57 On 2 October 2015, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (CPRD) has criticized the State of Qatar, for not ratifying the Marrakesh Treaty, and recommended that it
should adopt all appropriate measures to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.58

Finally, as a general note on disability legislation in the Gulf States compared to the situation in other developing
countries, the Gulf States’ disability legislation and policies are based on their commitments to ratify international human
rights treaties, but their implementation is weak and ineffective. For the future development of disability laws in the Gulf
States, it is important to build upon the international principles available under international treaties and not only
enshrine them within national legislation, but also apply them in practice to help and benefit disabled and VIPs.

7 | THE INADEQUACY OF COPYRIGHT LAWS IN THE GULF STATES

7.1 | Overview of the legal system in the Gulf States

The Gulf legal system is based on continental European civil law, rather than the common law. Legislation and not case-law
is the primary source of laws in the Gulf States. Judicial precedents do not have a binding authority (stare decisis), but only a
persuasive authority. This is because courts in the Gulf region are not bound by their own decisions or by the decisions of
other courts, even if it was issued by a higher court, as each case is considered unique (Al Tamimi, 2003, p. 21). Many laws in
the Gulf States are inspired by Egyptian legislation that is modeled on French law (Hansen, 2009, p. XXVII; Wahab, 2012).
The Gulf States have adopted the Egyptian Civil Code of 1948, as amended, that covers personal rights, contracts,
obligations and torts that are heavily influenced by the French Napoleonic Code or French civil law.59 They have also other
similar laws in other fields of private law such as commercial law, labor law and intellectual property law.

Sharia law is the religious text of the Holy Quran, and the saying and the practice of the Prophet Mohammad
(Sunnah). Sharia is still important in the Gulf States especially in relation to personal status and family matters such as
divorce, inheritance and child custody.60 Furthermore, it is one of the formal sources of law that should be consulted
when legislation is silent (Turner, 2011).

OLWAN

Finally, it should be noted that there are some differences existing between the legal systems of the Gulf States.
For example, the UAE is a federal state and has two types of laws, federal and local. The federal law is issued by the
federal government and applied across the country while the local law is issued by a particular Emirate and applied
only in that Emirate (Gorse, 2016, p. 289). The free zone Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) was established in
2004 in the Emirate of Dubai has a unique court system that follows the common law.61

7.2 | Author's rights system in the Gulf States

All Gulf States are members of the TRIPS Agreement that outlines the minimum standards of protection for
copyright.62 A few Gulf States, such as, Bahrain and Oman, have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United
States63 and as a result their level of copyright protection is considered to be “TRIPS Plus” (Drahos, 1999; Drahos,
2001, pp. 792–793; Drahos, 2002, pp. 767–777; Drahos, 2003, pp. 6–11; Gervais, 2013, pp. 95–112; Okediji, 2003,
p. 338; Olwan, 2016, p. 427; Yu, 2006, pp. 283–286; Yu, 2007), compared to the remaining Gulf States that are
instead “TRIPS” only.

The Gulf States follow the continental European system of author's rights applied in civil law countries and not the
copyright system applied in common law countries (Bently (ed.), 2015, pp. FRA-11-12; Goldstein & Hugenholt, 2013, pp.
19–22; Lewinski, 2008, pp. 33–63; Olwan, 2016, 429). The Egyptian Code of Intellectual Property64 has inspired copyright
laws in the Gulf States that adopt the dualist approach toward copyright providing authors two kinds of rights: moral and
economic (Arif, 2014, p. 42; Fitzgerald & Olwan, 2010, pp. 565–566). The moral rights of the author include the right of
paternity; the right of integrity; the right of consideration; the right to object to derogatory treatment, and the right of
withdrawal.65 As for the economic or financial rights, there is the right of reproduction and the right of performance
(communication to the public), and the right of resale among other.66 The copyright law in Gulf States gives also additional
neighboring or related rights mainly to performers, phonograms producers and broadcasting organizations.67

Under the copyright laws of the Gulf States, a protected work cannot be legally reproduced, adapted, digitized, or
formatted without the author's authorization. As in other jurisdictions, copyright laws in the Gulf States provide a
number of exceptions to author's rights68 that are determined on a case-by-case basis (Bently (ed), 2015, p. FRA-126;
Bently & Sherman, 2014, pp. 28-31; Spitz, 2015, pp. 106–107), and must be interpreted restrictively (exception est
strictissimae interpretationis) in favor of the copyright holder. The Berne Convention requires member Gulf States when
drafting their limitations and exceptions69 to abide by the Berne's Three-Step Test that must not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the work or constitute unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the author.70

7.3 | The exceptions to VIPs

As explained, the copyright laws in the Gulf States have an enumerated and restrictive list of exceptions that allow the use of
copyrighted works for specific determined purposes that are in line with the French law, particularly Article L122-5 of the
Intellectual Property Code (IPC) in relation to exceptions to copyright and neighboring rights71 (French AIPPI Group, 2010).
These exceptions are different from the United States Copyright Law of 1976, as amended, which adopts a more flexible system
called “fair use”72 as compared to other Anglo-Saxon countries such as the United Kingdom,73 Australia74 and Canada.75

Copyright laws in the Gulf States permit various uses of copyrighted materials for no cost and without taking the
permission of copyright owners in specific determined circumstances (Olwan, 2016, pp. 423–427). These include
private copying, performance within the family circle, analyses and quotations, temporary acts of reproduction, press
reviews, speeches and teaching and educational purposes,76 but the application of these exceptions in practice is still
unclear in the Gulf States as there are few court decisions that deal with the issue.77

Unfortunately, the majority of copyright laws in the Gulf States do not mention blind, visually impaired and other
reading disabled people, and do not provide specific copyright exceptions for their benefit.78 This means that any use
or adaptation of a work into a more accessible format by a blind person or anyone working on his behalf constitutes
copyright infringement of the author's rights.

188 |

OLWAN

If there are no exceptions for VIPs in the copyright laws of the Gulf States, is it possible to apply the education
exceptions79 or libraries exceptions80 on VIPs? The answer is that it is difficult to apply those exceptions on VIPs for
the reasons explained below.

First, the use of work for education may allow the translation of works but does not allow converting it to
accessible format copies. Second, these exceptions are specific and do not approve clearly “format shifting” that
allows the conversion of print materials to alternative and accessible formats for educational purposes even if that is
used for VIPs. Third, the education exceptions do not permit educational institutions to digitize copyrighted materials
to be used for distance learners and students living in rural areas having sensory-disabilities. In addition, copyright laws
in the Gulf States fail to address the issue of cross-border transfer of published works made accessible to VIPs and
“parallel importation” is not clearly mentioned in these copyright laws.81

In particular, the Gulf States’ copyright laws are mostly silent allowing accessible format copies from third
countries to be imported without the consent of copyright holders. The availability of such a provision would help VIPs
and organizations assisting those that want to import accessible copies available in other countries for distribution in
the region (Wiele, 2014, p. 41; Yun, 2012, pp. 463–464).

7.4 | Technological protection measures (TPMs)

The emergence of Digital Rights Management (DRM) in the digital age and the problems of anti-encryption
regulations pose a further hurdle to VIPs to access published works (IFPI, 2003; Yun, 2012, p. 439).

DRM are access control technologies used to protect the copyright of digital media, and it is extremely important
from the perspective of copyright owners in order to control access to, and the use of their works to make sure
appropriate financial revenues are given (Bertlesman, 2012, p. 49). Copyright owners and holders increasingly rely on
TPMs, and these include digital access codes, encryption, digital locks and other copy protection methods (Australian
Human Rights Commission (AHRC), 2004; Schonwetter et al., 2015, p. 11; Group of Specialists on Human Rights in the
Information Society (MC-S-IS)).

For VIPs, the circumvention of TPMs is necessary, as it would allow them to convert e-books and other works that
they lawfully obtain into a spoken language or make Braille copies to help with their visual impairment (Wiele, 2014, p.
45; UK Intellectual Property Office). It is important to discuss TPMs under the copyright laws of the Gulf States and
examine to what extent they can constitute an extra hurdle for VIPs and their accessibility to published works.

All Gulf States have specific provisions to deal with DRM mainly in relation to Technological Protection Measures
(TPMs) and Rights-Management Information (RMI). These provisions were included in the copyright laws of the Gulf
States mainly because of entering into international copyright treaties (WIPO and WPPT)82 or signing Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs) with the United States.

The Gulf States’ copyright laws expressly provide for civil, criminal and administrative remedies for the
circumvention of TPMs.83 They prohibit the trafficking in devices (manufacturing, importing distribution) that are used
for circumvention.84 The prohibition on the circumvention of TPMs is absolute for the majority of copyright laws in
the Gulf States that do not have limitations or exceptions to permit circumvention for any legitimate purpose such as
reverse engineering, security testing, encryption research, inter-operability and print disability.

Bahrain and Oman are the only countries among the Gulf States that provide exceptions for the circumvention of
TPMs. The Bahraini Copyright Law includes clear exceptions for the circumvention of TPMs specifically for
functionaries, representatives or contractors in order to enforce the law and investigate crimes and for other, security
and other governmental activities.85 On the other hand, the Omani Copyright Laws also provide exceptions for the
circumvention of TPMs for “non-profit public library, a document keeping agency, educational or scientific or cultural
institution, or a non-commercial governmental broadcasting corporation”, if they believe that they are not in violation
of the law.86 Finally, the Gulf States have not appointed any authority for regulating TPMs and for marketing the
devices that can be used for the protection and identification of works.

OLWAN

The Gulf States need to amend their TPM provisions in the copyright laws to comply with the Marrakesh Treaty.
They should ensure that TPMs do not prevent VIPs and authorized entities from enjoying the limitations and
exceptions under the Treaty (Helfer et al., 2017, p.63). In particular, it is important to have in the copyright laws clear
rights for beneficiary persons and authorized entities for the circumvention of TPMs for the purposes of creating and
distributing accessible copies of works (Cameron et al., 2014). In addition, these laws should allow the manufacturing,
distribution and importation of devices or equipment to overcome access control technologies. This is particularly
important not only for the Gulf States but also for other developing countries, which are likely to be more duly
burdened by TPMs and DRM provisions (Helfer et al., 2017, p. 67).

It is fair to conclude that the current copyright regimes of the Gulf States are unsatisfactory for the purpose of
VIPs as they do not contain any kind of exception regarding the circumvention of TPMs for their benefit and
amendments to these laws are necessary. This will be explained further in detail in section 9.

8 | THE EXCEPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY IN THE FRENCH
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CODE

The Gulf States should learn from the experience of other countries particularly those that follow similar legal systems,
such as France. As explained, copyright laws in the Gulf States were inspired by the French Intellectual Property Code
(IPC), and it is important to consider to what extent they might benefit from such a system to develop their own.
The Marrakesh Treaty has not been ratified by either France nor by other E.U member States. This is despite the
fact that the European Union (E.U) Council, signed the Treaty on 30 April 2014 in Geneva, and the E.U Commission has
proposed the ratification after obtaining the proper consent from the European Parliament (European Commission,
2014; Saez, 2014; Zemer & Gaon, 2015, p. 842). On 6 July 2017, The European Parliament adopted two legal
instruments to implement the Marrakesh Treaty that need to be formally approved. These include the Proposal for a
Directive on permitted uses of works and other subject-matter protected by copyright and related rights for the
benefit of VIPs (2016/0278 (COD)),87 and the Proposed Regulation on the cross-border exchange between the Union
and third countries of accessible format copies of certain works for VIPs (2016/0279 (COD)).88 (Ermert, 2017;
European Parliament, 2017; International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), 2017).

The French Intellectual Property Code (IPC), as amended (Law No 2006–961 of 1 August 2006) provides in
Articles L.122-5(7) and L.211-3(6) exceptions for the benefit of disabled people.89 The law permits the reproduction
of works and also performance (communication to the public by public institutions and organizations for the personal
use of disabled people (Bently (ed.), 2015, pp. FRA 130-131; French AIPPI Group, 2010; Spinali, 2008; Spitz, 2015, p.
116). Articles L.122–13 to L.122–21 of the IPC, organize in great detail, the conditions in which the organizations
open to the public may implement this exception90 (Spitz, 2015, p. 116). The French law is clear in broadening the
definition of the people who can benefit from this exception to include not only blind people, but also people with
physical, mental and psychological disability (French APPI Group). The exception does not give any compensation to
authors (Bently (ed.), pp. FRA 130–131), and it also requires publishers to adopt a more proactive role in making their
digital files available to certified public organizations (libraries, archives, documentation and cultural centers) to enable
them to provide and distribute accessible format copies (Bently (ed.), pp. FRA 130–131; Cabut, 2013; Sullivan, 2006,
p. 90–91).

It might be a good idea for the Gulf States to consider developing their own system based on the French model
and law for the following reasons. First, the exceptions under the French Intellectual Property Code (IPC) are not only
applicable to blind people but also generally to other disabled people. This approach is recommended because it will
benefit the wider community of disabled people in the region. Second, the requirement under the law for publishers to
make their digital works available for certified public organizations is also encouraged because it will increase the
number of available books in the Gulf States. Third, the system has proper restrictions and guarantees in place (who
can use and when) to make sure that the rights of authors and publishers alike will not be used improperly and

190 |

OLWAN

infringed. Fourth, the law does not require any kind of compensation for authors, and this corresponds to the
copyright system in the Gulf States and also the Marrakesh Treaty (Helfer, et al., 2017, pp. 49–51).

One problem with the application of exceptions under French law is that it requires the disabled person to fulfill a
specific standard to be able to enjoy the exception and be entitled to an accessible copy (Sullivan, 2006, p. 30, 58).
Unfortunately, as explained earlier, the Gulf States do not define disability and there is no specific and unified standard
that is used to determine disability and visual impairment in the region. Furthermore, French law is not in conformity with
the Marrakesh Treaty, particularly in relation to the cross-border exchange and importation of accessible format copies,
and it requires the Gulf States to review and reform such a system carefully before its adoption in their local laws.

Finally, it is important for Gulf States to learn from the best practices of other countries that have updated their copyright
laws to accommodate the needs of visually impaired persons, such as the United States,91 (NLS FactSheets, 1996), the United
Kingdom,92 (Winenand, 2014), Canada93 (Awad, 2016; Cox, 2016; Fuchterman, 2013; Pillali, 2012) Australia,94 India,95 (Gurry,
2016; Pillai, 2012) Brazil,96 China97 and many other countries (UNDP, p. 32; Sloan & Hortan, 2014).

9 | THE WAY FORWARD: THE FUTURE OF VIPS IN THE GULF STATES

9.1 | The legal recommendations for VIPs

As the UAE has ratified the Marrakesh Treaty, it should make immediate amendments to its copyright regime to
implement the Treaty and abide by its international obligations.

The UAE has a variety of options on how it should reform its copyright law to correspond with its international
obligations under the Marrakesh Treaty. One option is to amend the UAE Copyright Law by using the language of the
actual text of the Treaty, and the second option is to issue a separate implementation regulation in relation to the
Treaty (Trimble, 2014, p. 794; UNDP, 2015, p. 25).

The key definitions of the Marrakesh Treaty, including “accessible format copy”, “authorized entity”, “beneficiary
persons” and “print disability” should be included in the UAE Copyright Law. A good suggestion would be to include
examples of print disabilities in a non-exhaustive manner, and broaden the definition of “beneficiary persons” by not
restricting it to persons who are blind or visually impaired, but also include other kinds of disabilities such as mental,
motor, hearing and persons with dyslexia (Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 31–38; Li, 2014, pp. 741–750; UNDP, 2015, pp. 18–19;
Vezzoso, 2014, p. 811). This corresponds with the position of French law that was discussed in section 8.

The definitions available in the Marrakesh Treaty can be used as a model to amend Article 1 (definitions) of the

UAE Copyright Law for that purpose.

Unfortunately, Article 22 of the UAE Copyright Law does not allow the domestic creation and distribution of
accessible format copies by a VIP or a non-profit organization. In order to comply with Article 4 of the Marrakesh
Treaty, the law should be amended by including a clear, simple and technology natural exception for VIPs (2014).
Article 22 of the UAE Copyright Law98 should be amended as follows:

22. Without prejudice to the moral rights of the author set out in this law, the author, after the publication of
his work, may not prevent others from doing any of the following acts:

1–8 . . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . ..

9—The making, acquiring, supplying and distribution of accessible format copies for the sole benefit of the
beneficiary person.

The authorized entity wishing to undertake such activities must supply the work exclusively to the
beneficiary person and needs to have lawful access to the work and provide services on a non-commercial
basis.99

OLWAN

| 191

Article 37 of the UAE Copyright Law makes it a criminal offense to manufacture (or produce) and import works for the
purpose of sale, rental or circulation. This is applicable on importation of authorized copies of work as well as the importation
of unauthorized copies or counterfeit copies (Hansen, 2009, p. 240). In order to comply with Articles 5 and 6 of the
Marrakesh Treaty, Article 37 of the UAE Copyright Law must allow authorized entities to import and export accessible
format copies to serve VIPs. Article 37 of the UAE Copyright Law (Hansen, 2009) should be amended as follows:

37. Without prejudice to any harsher punishment stated in any other law, any person who, without the
written permission of the author or the holder of neighboring rights, or their successors, does any of the
following act, is to be punished by imprisonment for a period of any least two months and a fine not less than
10,000 dirhams and not exceeding 50,000 dirhams or either one of these:

1. Infringes any of the moral or financial rights of the author or holder of a neighboring rights as set out in this
law, including putting any work or performance or sound recording or broadcast program that is protected
by this law within the reach of the public whether by means of computer or the Internet or formation
networks or communication networks or any other means.

2. Sells or rents or make available for circulation in any way a work or sound recording or broadcast program
protected pursuant to the provisions of this law.
The punishment set out in this article is to be multiplied according to the number of works or performances
or broadcasts or recordings the subject of the crime. If the crime is committed again, imprisonment for not
less than six months and a fine of not less than 50,000 dirhams are to be imposed.

3) Notwithstanding subsection 1 and 2, an accessible format copy can be imported by an authorized entity
or a beneficiary person without the permission of the copyright holder by any means, including non-
commercial lending or by electronic communication by wired or wireless means.

4) Notwithstanding subsection 1 and 2, an accessible format copy can be exported by an authorized entity
to any other authorized entity or any other non-profit institution that provide services to the blind, visually
impaired or otherwise print disabled. (UNDP, 2015, pp. 91–93).

According to Article 38 of the UAE Copyright Law, it is also an infringement of the UAE's Copyright Law to import, sell
or rent devices that circumvent TPMs and to use a device “prepared with a sole object of infringing the copyright”. Article 38
of the UAE Copyright Law does not contain any exceptions or limitations for the circumvention of TPMs for any purpose. To
ensure that anti-circumvention provisions do not impede beneficiary persons from gaining access to accessible format
copies, an exception should be included in the UAE Copyright Law to allow the circumvention of the TPMs to allow the
creation of accessible format copies for VIPs. The exceptions should be flexible allowing the use of tools and services,
whether commercial or non-commercial that enable the circumvention as necessary or appropriate (EIFL, 2015, pp. 22–23).

Article 38 of the UAE Copyright Law (Hansen, 2009) should be amended as follows:

Without prejudice to any harsher punishment stated in any other law, any person who commits any of the
following acts is to be punished by imprisonment for a period of at least three months and a fine not less than
50,000 dirhams and not exceeding 500,000 dirhams:

1) Manufacturing or importing, without a right to do so, and with the purpose of selling or renting or circulating,
any work or counterfeit copies or any apparatus or means or tools designed or prepared specially for
manipulating protection or techniques used by the author or the holder of a neighboring right to transit or offer
for circulation or to regulate or to manage these rights or to preserve a specific clarity of quality of production.

192 |

OLWAN

2) Disabling or impairing, without a right to do so, any technical protection or electronic information
intended to regulate the right set out in this law.

3) Computer downloading or storing of any copy of computer programs or applications or databases without
a license from the author or right holder or their successors.

If the crimes are committed again, imprisonment for not less than nine months and a fine of not less than
200,000 dirhams is to be imposed.

4) Notwithstanding subsection 1 and 2, technological protection measures may be circumvented by an
authorized entity, beneficiary person or someone acting on his behalf in order to create accessible format copies
exclusively for the purpose of enjoying the exception provided in Article 22/9. (UNDP, 2015, pp. 91–93).

The UAE should avoid including the commercial availability clause or payment of any fee to the copyright holder
for the use of the accessible format copy. The inclusion of such a provision would impair the ability to use the
exceptions under the Marrakesh Treaty and lead to more time and resources being spent on determining whether a
commercially available, accessible format exists in the first place (Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 47–49; AGD; MBIE, 2015, p.
22). It is also not recommended under the UAE Copyright Law to mandate the payment of royalties to copyright
owners mainly because the Marrakesh Treaty does not require it. This approach should also be followed by other
developing countries that may not have enough financial resources to remunerate publishers and copyright holders in
order to serve the visually impaired community (Fruchterman, 2013; Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 49–51).

For the other Gulf States that have not joined the Marrakesh Treaty, the ratification of the Treaty is of paramount
importance, allowing these States to meet their international obligations under the CPRD, and other international human
rights treaties. It will also lead to invaluable benefits for libraries, government and similar non-profit organizations to
increase their extensive collection of works in Arabic or English, and domestic production of accessible format copies. To
make this a reality, these institutions not only need to encourage their states to join but they also need to make sure that
their governments take the necessary steps to implement the Treaty into their domestic law (EIFL, 2015, p. 13).

As previously discussed, a number of Gulf States have signed an FTA with the United States, including Bahrain and
Oman. It is important to give special attention to the copyright laws of those states if they want to join the Marrakesh Treaty
as they have international obligations beyond the minimum standards under the TRIPS Agreement. Alternatively, if any Gulf
State decides not to join the Marrakesh Treaty, it should amend the copyright law and include exceptions to benefit VIPs in
order to increase access to books and other published works for VIPs. The law should strike a balance between protecting
the interests of rights holders and simultaneously providing effective and equal access rights to VIPs. Furthermore, it should
be flexible and neutral as technology can change rapidly. Finally, it is suggested to use the same amendments that were
proposed for the UAE Copyright Law to reform other similar copyright laws in the Gulf States.

9.2 | The policy recommendations for VIPs

For a proper implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty, it is not enough to amend copyright laws in the Gulf States, but
also it is important to take other practical measures to assist VIPs.

To increase the availability of books and other published works and to ensure that they are accessible by VIPs in
the Gulf States, it is suggested, in the future, to introduce a mandatory deposit scheme that requires Arabic publishers
to deposit hard copy versions of their published books with government and non-profit organizations assisting VIPs
(Cameron et al., 2014). This would enable these public institutions in the Gulf States to efficiently supply accessible
format copies for VIPs (CDLP; Harpur & Suzor, 2013, pp. 753-754; Helfer et al., 2017, p. 66; Spinali, 2008). If the Gulf
States want to work together in this regard, they could create the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) National Digital
Accessible Library that protects the rights of copyright holders as well as increases the availability of books and

OLWAN

published works in accessible formats for VIPs such as audio and large print. This might not be possible without legal
reforms to the current laws in the Gulf States and in particular the copyright laws that must be amended to allow
government and non-profit entities that serve VIPs to import and export accessible format copies (cross-border
exchange system), firstly among the Gulf States and with other contracting parties to the Marrakesh Treaty.

None of these solutions would be contrary to the international obligations of the Gulf States, and would not
create an unreasonable prejudice to the interests of the copyright rights-holder if clear policies and basic security
measures are introduced to protect it from illegal use (Harpur & Suzor, 2013, pp. 753–754).

The Gulf States have a major role to play in making sure that the Marrakesh Treaty is implemented effectively.
First, they need to connect the implementation of the Treaty with other international human rights treaties that they
have ratified particularly the CPRD. This is essential in order to build on their existing knowledge, processes, measures
and institutions that they already have for the consistent application of their international obligations under
international treaties (Helfer et al., 2017, p. 78). Secondly, they need to consult with individuals and Disabled Persons’
Organizations (DPOs) in relation to amending their existing laws and devising effective practical measures to
implement the Treaty, and reporting the same to the United Nations and other relevant international institutions
(Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 82–83). Thirdly, they need to develop appropriate action plans for an effective implementation
of the Treaty. This can be achieved by integrating the Marrakesh Treaty's objectives with their current national plans
for disabled people, increasing awareness, expanding access to published works, and collecting data regarding such
access for future reference (Helfer et al., 2017, pp. 83–84). Finally, they need to provide remedies and construct
appropriate mechanisms for violating and enforcing the rights by of VIPs by allowing them to file complaints to
designated authorities, in relation to accessing and sharing accessible format copies (Helfer et al., 2017, p. 76).

Disabled Persons’ Organizations (DPOs) in the Gulf States that represent the interests of VIPs and the community
have an important role to play in encouraging the ratification and implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty. This is
because they have many advantages over governmental organizations as they can be flexible and swift in dealing with
the local needs and problems faced by the community (Fakhr, 2005, p. 2). They must take various steps and practical
measures to advocate the rights of VIPs in order to influence decision-making in their jurisdiction.

DPOs in the Gulf States need to work more often with one another and with other international organizations to

develop successful partnerships to meet their common goals and make the necessary changes in law and policy.

DPOs should not only be passive providers of self-help and social services for their members but rather they need to
engage more often in human rights debates and advocacy (Meyers, 2016, p. 6). They must participate fully in the
interpretation, implementation, monitoring the international human rights treaties in the Gulf States and in advising
international organizations accordingly. They need to raise public awareness about the rights of persons with disabilities and
hold regular open forums for members of their community and the public. These should discuss in particular the importance
of the Marrakesh Treaty and share best practices from around the world in relation to its adoption and implementation.
DPOs have an important role to play in mobilizing people to ask their governments, in the Gulf States, to sign the
Marrakesh Treaty and implement their international obligations under human rights treaties. They must, in particular,
contact and meet government officials and decision-makers in order to raise their awareness about the issues faced by
disabled people and VIPs. Unfortunately, there are limited Arabic publications in relation to the Marrakech Treaty and
it is important to write and publish more information about the subject. DPOs can produce and distribute information
pamphlets about the Marrakesh Treaty in Arabic and speak about the problems, rights, and needs of VIPs in various
forms of media such as print, radio, television and the Internet.

10 | CONCLUSION

We need to ask ourselves important questions about the Marrakesh Treaty. Will adherence to the Treaty help VIPs in
the Gulf States? What is the role of national governments in the Gulf States in terms of facilitating access to published
works for VIPs?

194 |

OLWAN

There is no doubt that technology has dramatically changed the lives of all individuals, including VIPs because it
allows them to access information and published works in a variety of ways never experienced before. It is also a fact
that copyright laws have become a barrier to access copyrighted materials, especially in the digital age as it prevents
users from producing and using an author's work without permission.

It is important for all Gulf States to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty for the benefit of VIPs because it would provide
them with great opportunities to access books and published works. Non-profit organizations and libraries would be
able to increase their published materials by benefiting from the availability of books available in many languages,
including Arabic and English.

Joining the Marrakesh Treaty is a step forward for the Gulf States to rethink their approach to copyright laws that need
to take into consideration not only authors’ rights but also the needs of other users. The amendments in the copyright laws
should create a fairer system for all those who use copyright including VIPs, and at the same time provide equal rights and
guarantees to people with disabilities (Bertlesman, 2012). This will hopefully lead to more comprehensive reforms of
copyright laws in the Gulf States particularly in relation to limitations and exceptions to author's rights.

The article has provided various suggestions and recommendations to amend the copyright laws in the Gulf after
reviewing relevant international human treaties that these states have signed and their national disability laws. It has
also given particular attention to governments’ role in helping visually impaired communities and supporting non-
profit organizations in creating repositories for the benefit of VIPs.

It is essential not to raise the hopes of the visually impaired community in terms of alleviating the “book
famine”. While the Marrakesh Treaty is important in offering a legal infrastructure and an international framework
to help visually impaired community around the world, it, unfortunately, will not make a real difference in the life
of this marginalized community unless society as a whole removes the technical, legal and cultural barriers that
prevent access to books and published works for VIPs (Fruchterman, 2013; United Nations Human Rights (UNHR),
2014).

3 “Almost 30 years ago, a joint WIPO/UNESCO study had already recommended the formulation of a new international
instrument addressing the two related problems of the “production of special media materials” and the “cross-border
distribution of those materials...” Brazil was the first country to broach the copyright problems faced by visually impaired
persons at an international level in 1977” (Fiscor, April 2013).

4 There were several important issues that arose during the negotiating of the draft treaty including: “whether it should take
the form of a binding agreement or a recommendation; the types of disabilities and the rights to be included; the classes of
beneficiaries; the extent of relaxations to be provided for developing countries; the relationship to the Berne Conventions’
three-step test; the question of commercial availability; and the use of technological protection measures”. (Brown et al.,
2012, p. 928; Brown & Welde, 2015, pp. 577–602).

19 “Book famine” is the lack of access to published works in accessible formats for blind and visually impaired persons.
20 For example, Article 2 of the UAE Disability Law defines “a person with special needs as every person suffering from a
temporary or permanent, full or partial deficiency or infirmity in his physical, sensory, mental, communicational, educational
or psychological abilities to an extent that limits his possibility of performing the same requirements as people without
special needs.” See Federal Law No. (29) of 2006 Concerning the Rights of People with Special Needs http://www.albayan.ae/
across-the-uae/2006-09-11-1.868190

21 One report prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned the various challenges in relation to disability in
the region. These include: “defining disability; the lack of data and information on disability; the domination of the concept
of “care” over inclusion in addressing the issue; the discrepancy between the current level of political commitment with the
magnitude of disability; the gap in understanding how commitments are translated into action; the fragmentation of
existing efforts; and insufficient or ineffective coordination mechanisms between the concerned sectors”. There are also

196 |

gaps in the essential care and service provision, including rehabilitation services, together with the limited human resources
in different aspects and the variation in the level of development in the Gulf States (WHO, 2012).

22 Bahrain and Kuwait joined the WTO on 11 December 2005; UAE on 10 April 1996; Qatar on 13 January 1996; Oman on 9
November 2000, and Saudi Arabia on 11 December 2005. See Part II (intellectual property rights) and Part III (enforcement
of intellectual property rights) of the TRIPs Agreement https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips.pdf

23 For example, the United States Trade Representatives (USTR) reports of 2016 and 2017 puts Kuwait on its Priority Watch
List for failing to adequately protect intellectual property (copyright). See Office of the United States Trade
Representatives, 2017 Special 301 Report

20Report%20FINAL.PDF, and 2016 Special 301 Report https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/USTR-2016-Special-301-
Report.pdf

24 For example, in the UAE, the Zayed Higher Organization for Humanitarian Care and Special Needs and Tamkeen are

converting schoolbooks to accessible formats for blind students and other visually impaired persons.

25 There are also other challenges facing publication in Arabic and these include: “lack of reliable figures about book
production and sales; insufficient readership; censorship and issues related to freedom of expression; difficulties of regional
distribution and piracy, and barriers to the development of publishing structures” (Buchmesse, 2014).

provisions permitting fair dealing for the purpose of parody and satire (S41A), time-shifting (S111), device shifting (S109A)
and format-shifting (S43C, 47J and 110AA). See the Australian Copyright Act of 1968 (ACA) as amended, Part III- Copyright
in Original Literary, Dramatic, Musical and Artistic Works, Division 3 Act Not Constituting Infringements of Copyright in
Works http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC,
2013) has proposed on February 13, 2014 the introduction of an open-list style of exceptions and limitations (fair use) in
Australia, but the Australian law has not been amended still.

75 In Canada, the new amendments to the Copyright Modernization Act of June 2012 (Bill-C11) introduced new exceptions and
these include: commercial user-generated content (S29.21), non-reproduction for private purposes (S29.22), backup
copies (S29.24), backup of computer program (30.6), interoperability of computer program (S30.61), encryption research
(S30.62), security (S30.63), temporary reproductions for technological processes (S30.71), and persons with perceptual
difficulties (S32). See Copyright Modernization Act (CMA) (Bill C-11) http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/. Canadian
scholars and legal experts have considered at length and debated the introduction of American fair use system into the
Canadian Copyright Law (Geist, 2013, pp. 157–186).

76 Article 15 of the Saudi Copyright Law; Article 29 of the Kuwait Copyright Law; Article 18 of the Qatari Copyright Law;
Article 19 of the Bahraini Copyright Law; Article 20 of the Omani Copyright Law, and Article 22 of the UAE Copyright Law.
77 One of the decision by the UAE Dubai Court of Cassation found on 17 June 2007 that libraries are allowed to make one
copy or more of copyrighted works in any suitable format provided that the number of copies is limited to the needs and
without prejudice to the rights of the author. Appeal No. 92/ 2007, civil decision, date, 17 June 2007.

78 An exception of this is the new Kuwaiti Copyright Law No. 22 of 2016 in Article 29/14 that facilitates accessibility to work
without an authors’ permission to a disabled person via electronic communication. The law has several conditions and these
include: (a) the person should have a legitimate copy of the work; (b) the person must convert the work to accessible format
and not make any changes; (c) this should be done for non-profit purposes; (d) only for personal use and (e) it is possible to
import and export the accessible format copy to allow a disabled person to access it. See Article 29/14 of the Kuwait Law
