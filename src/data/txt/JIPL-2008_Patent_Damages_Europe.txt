Patent damages: the European landscape
Gregory J. Urbanchuk and James R. Tumbridge*

Businesses and consumers are increasingly becoming
more global and this convergence is being driven, in
part, by the spread of technology. Recent statistics pub-
lished by the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) suggest that non-resident patent applications
increased from approximately 280,000 in 1985 to in
excess of 600,000 in 2005.1 The convergence of global
markets and the spread of technology create unique
challenges for inventors and companies seeking to
enforce their patent rights in foreign jurisdictions.
While global markets continue to converge, the same
cannot be said for the rules governing the quantiﬁ-
cation of damages when enforcing patent rights. In the
context of enforcement rules, the remedies available to
compensate a patent holder for infringement must be
quantiﬁed by reference to the rules of the jurisdiction
in question.

The need to understand foreign patent enforcement
rules is particularly true for US inventors and com-
panies, which according to the WIPO statistics re-
presented approximately 23 percent of non-resident
patent ﬁlings on a worldwide basis during 2005.2 The
European Union Member States are often favourite
ﬁling destinations for many inventors and companies
seeking patent protection outside the USA. According
to the European Patent Ofﬁce (EPO), US companies
accounted for 25 percent of patent applications ﬁled in
the EU Member States.3

The primary objective of this article is to provide an
overview of the patent damages rules in the EU and to
identify some of the challenges US companies and
inventors should be aware of as they seek to enforce
their patent rights in Europe. First, it reviews the lack
of a Community patent and the ability to enforce
damage awards across the EU Member States in the
context of patent damages. Secondly, it considers the
impact of the implementation of Directive 2004/48 on

Several recent attempts have been made to move the harmonization
process forward. In March 2007, the European Commission published a
Communication entitled, ‘Enhancing the patent system in Europe’. This
Communication addressed the problems of the current patent system and
provided a compromise aimed at achieving the Community patent and
the implementation of the European Patent Litigation Agreement
(‘EPLA’). The Communication also proposed a single jurisdictional
system for patent litigation within the EU, which was based on the EPLA
model but allowed for the harmonious integration of the Community
jurisdiction. In regard to the proposals set out in the Communication,

it remains a distant reality as numerous outstanding
issues await resolution, for example: (1) the adoption of
a text for the proposed Regulation on the Community
Patent, which would supersede the previous Proposal for
a Community Patent of 1 August 2000; (2) the adoption
of
two proposed Council Decisions establishing the
Community Patent Court and conferring jurisdiction on
the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in disputes con-
cerning the Community patent; and (3) the amendment
of the European Patent Convention (‘EPC’ to allow the
EPO to issue Community patents).

Enforcement of damage awards across EU
Member States
In the absence of broader harmonization, the damage
remedies available to compensate for patent infringe-
ment must be quantiﬁed by reference to the national
rules of
the
enforcement of damage awards rendered in one juris-
diction may be enforceable across EU Member States.
Speciﬁcally, Article 33 of the Brussels Regulation notes
that the judgment of one Member State will be recog-
nized by another Member State without any special
procedures. Further, Article 34 of the same Regulation
notes that a judgment will not be recognized by a
Member State if any of the following conditions apply:

(i)

Such recognition is contrary to public policy in the
member state in which recognition is sought.

(ii) The judgment was given in default of an appearance.
(iii) The judgment is contrary to a judgment that has already

been given.

The EU IP enforcement directive
In the context of damage rules, the remedies available
for infringement were quantiﬁed by reference to the
rules of the jurisdiction in which enforcement was
sought, which often differed amongst Member States.
However, in April 2004, the European Parliament and
Council adopted the EU IP Enforcement Directive. The
primary purpose of the Directive was to create a level
playing ﬁeld for the enforcement of IP rights across the
Member States by establishing a homogenized set of
enforcement measures.

The changes brought to national IP regimes by the
Directive have received a mixed reaction across Europe,
but broadly they have been welcomed. However,
its
implementation has not been entirely clear-cut as
around half the Member States missed the 29 April 2006
deadline for transposition. Further, without a centralized

system of litigation (eg a true Community patent or a
European Patent Litigation Agreement), the damages
rules set out in the Directive are subject to interpretation
by national courts. These courts may take divergent
views as to the meaning of undeﬁned terms and the
methodology used to quantify the broadly deﬁned
damage terms set out in the Directive, which is contrary
to the primary objective of a level playing ﬁeld.

Article 13 and damages
The quantiﬁcation of damages arising from infringe-
ment is set out in Article 13 of the Directive:

1. Where the infringer ‘knowingly’ engaged in infringing

activity damages shall:

(a) take into account all appropriate aspects, such as
the negative economic consequences,
including
lost proﬁts, which the injured party has suffered,
any unfair proﬁts made by the infringer, and, in
appropriate cases, elements other than economic
factors, such as the moral prejudice caused by the
infringement; or

(b) as an alternative to (a), as a lump sum on the basis
the amount of

such as at

least

of elements
hypothetical royalties.

2. Where the infringer did not knowingly engage in
infringing activity, judicial authorities may order the
recovery of proﬁts or the payment of damages, which
may be pre-established.

‘known’ versus ‘unknown’

Undeﬁned terms and interpretational
differences
Article 13 introduces undeﬁned terms that require
interpretation by national courts, including the impact
of
infringement and the
meaning ascribed to terms such as ‘unfair proﬁts’ and
‘moral prejudice’. Until clearer deﬁnitions are provided,
it is difﬁcult to assess the impact of these terms on the
quantiﬁcation of damages. However, it is safe to say
that these terms provide an additional layer of uncer-
tainty to the quantiﬁcation of patent damages.

Further, the deﬁnition of damage remedies (eg lost
proﬁts, unfair proﬁts, and royalties) set out in Article
13 will be subject to the legal interpretation by the
relevant judges of national courts, which may differ
among Member States. Interpretational differences that
may inﬂuence the quantiﬁcation of patent damages

the Portuguese EU Presidency published a working document in July
2007, which was followed by a working document on European patent

litigation published by the Slovenian EU presidency in January 2008.
Despite these initiatives, there remains a lack of political consensus.

may include: (1) the measure of proﬁts (eg incremen-
tal, full absorption, and accounting); (2) the method
used to apportion proﬁts between infringing and non-
infringing elements; (3) the consideration of price
erosion and ancillary or convoyed sales; and (4) the
treatment of design around costs in royalty calcu-
lations. If these differences were to arise, they could
create national disparities in the amount of damages
awarded. To understand more fully how the interpret-
ation of a common set of damage rules could result in
differing damage awards, it is helpful to consider how
the Directive was transposed into the laws of
the
Member States and how these Member States have
historically viewed damages for the infringement of
patents. The following section considers the implemen-
tation and likely impact of the Directive in the UK,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy.

A survey of patent damage rules
United Kingdom
The Directive was implemented into UK law on 29
April 2006 through the enactment of a statutory instru-
ment.5 While the implementation of the Directive in
the UK was not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact
on UK law, its adoption may affect the quantiﬁcation
of patent damages in the UK.

the Directive,

Before the UK’s adoption of

the
Patents Act 1977 (as amended) speciﬁed that, in asses-
sing patent damages, ‘[T]he court shall not, in respect
of the same infringement, both award the proprietor of
a patent damages and order that he shall be given an
account of the proﬁts’. In other words, the claimant
was required to elect between an account of the defen-
dant’s proﬁts and an enquiry as to damages.6 In Island
Records Limited v Tring International Plc,7 the Court
provided guidance on the election between damage
remedies, noting that the claimant is required to make
an election between damage remedies based on limited
information and that, once this election is made, recov-
ery under the alternative remedy is prohibited.8

However, Article 13 of the Directive indicates that,
when setting damages, the court should consider both

5 The Intellectual Property (Enforcement, etc.) Regulations 2006 (Statutory

Instrument No. 1028).

6 The Patents Act 1977 superseded the Patents Act 1949, which also

required the claimant to elect between alternative damage remedies.
However, between 1919 and 1949, an election was not required as the
account of proﬁts remedy was not available. See H McGregor, McGregor
on Damages. (Sweet and Maxwell, London, 2003).

the claimant’s lost proﬁts and any unjust proﬁts made
by the infringer. This raises two signiﬁcant questions.
First, in the context of the UK, has the election between
damage remedies in effect been eliminated through the
implementation of the Directive? From a case law per-
spective, Celanese International Corp. v BP Chemicals
Ltd9 was the ﬁrst case to address the account of proﬁts
remedy in a patent infringement case in the UK for over
150 years. Given the lack of historical precedent and use
of the account of proﬁts remedy, it will be of interest to
see how the English courts interpret the Directive. Sec-
ondly, as addressed in greater detail below, the method-
ology set out in the national
laws of other Member
States has historically differed with respect to the meth-
odology used to elect between damage remedies.

France
The Directive was implemented in France in October
2007 through the enactment of the French Act L. no.
2007-1544. Before the adoption of
the Directive,
liability for patent damages was based on general tort
provisions of Article 1382 of the Civil Code, whereby
damages were those that were a certain and measurable
result of the infringement. Furthermore, an account of
the defendant’s proﬁts was historically an allowable
method of recovery under French law. Accordingly, the
addition of an account of proﬁts remedy under the
Directive constitutes a major change in French law.
From an economic perspective,
the addition of an
account of proﬁts remedy could in theory increase
the quantum of patent damages in France, which have
historically been quite low.

Germany
The Directive has not yet been implemented into
German law. The primary area of concern for German
practitioners relates
to the disclosure provisions of
the Directive. From a damage perspective, however, the
Directive was viewed as broadly consistent with the
damage remedies provided for under German Law,
which provides for the election between three damage
remedies: (1) an account of
the defendant’s proﬁts;
(2) lost proﬁts; and (3) a reasonable royalty. Historically,

8 This guidance is absent from earlier judgments such as Neilson v Betts
(1871) L.R. 5H.L. 1 and DeVitre v Betts (1873) L.R. 6H.L. 319, which
merely afﬁrm that the claimant must make an election between damage
remedies.

in excess of 90 percent of German damage calculations
were advanced by reference to a reasonable royalty meth-
odology, which may result from the scarcity of published
judgments addressing the lost proﬁts and account of
proﬁts methodology. However, the account of proﬁts
remedy is becoming more attractive since the Federal
Supreme Court decision in Gemeinkostenanteil.10 In
Gemeinkostenanteil the court ruled that, in an account of
proﬁts calculation, the infringer could only deduct those
costs that were attributable to the infringing activity,
though overhead costs were generally not deductible. In
addition, under German law, a claimant is not precluded
from recovering under an alternative damage remedy
once an election is made.

The Netherlands
The Directive was implemented in the Netherlands with
the prevailing view that the general framework of reme-
dies set out in the Directive already existed in the Dutch
courts. In the Netherlands, the Patent Act 1910, which
was superseded by the Patent Act 1995, provided for the
recovery of damages by reference to alternative damage
remedies: an account of the defendant’s proﬁts and a
claim for damages, which may include lost proﬁts and
related damages or a reasonable royalty. The method for
electing between damage remedies was afﬁrmed in
Dupont v Globe,11 which stated that a claimant could
pursue the alternative damage remedies in parallel and
that the court would award the higher of the two reme-
dies. In the Netherlands, as in Germany, there is very
little substantial case law related to the quantiﬁcation of
patent damages, which may explain the propensity for
settlement upon the establishment of liability. Accord-
ingly, jurisdictions with a higher density of established
case law, such as the UK, may yield higher damage
awards resulting from the additional judicial certainty as
to the likely amount of a judgment.

Italy
The Directive was implemented in Italy through Legis-
lative Decree 140/2006, which amended the new Italian
IP Code that was published in March 2005. Before the
implementation of the Directive, there was little statu-
tory authority in relation to the quantiﬁcation of
patent damages by which damages were typically
assessed based on the amounts the claimant could
demonstrate. Although rare, it was even theoretically
possible, before the Legislative Decree, for a claimant to
recover damages under both an account of the defen-
dant’s proﬁts and a lost proﬁts/reasonable royalty
methodology. The implementation of the Directive is
viewed as providing clearer guidance related to the
quantiﬁcation of patent damages in Italy.

Integration of law and economics
A reliable quantiﬁcation of patent damages requires the
effective integration of
law and economics. This is
particularly challenging in the EU, where in the absence
of more fulsome harmonization measures, such as the
Community Patent or the EPLA, the quantiﬁcation of
patent damages is based on the national
laws of the
Member States. The EU IP Enforcement Directive sought
to create a homogenized set of damage rules across the
Member States. However, many of the challenges pre-
sented by the transposition of the Directive into the laws
of the Member States are subject to interpretation by
national courts. Based on historical differences in case
law, the interpretation of the Directive is likely to differ
amongst
the Member States.
Although the Directive attempts to level the playing ﬁeld,
the quantiﬁcation of damages is likely to remain a com-
partmentalized and regional affair that requires a detailed
knowledge of case law and the jurisdiction in question.
