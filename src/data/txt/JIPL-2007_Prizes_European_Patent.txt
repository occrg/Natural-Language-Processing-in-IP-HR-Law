Mantras and management
In recent years, the European Patent Ofﬁce (EPO) has
been focussing on ways to shorten the time it takes for
an application for a European patent to be granted.
Under the general heading of ‘Mastering the Work-
load’—an EPO slogan that seems to have become
something of a mantra for that body—several changes
in the way in which the EPO handles applications have
taken place. These include using the same examiner to
draw up the search report on an application and to
perform the
examination,
extending the search report to include an opinion on
patentability, shortening the available time for the ﬁnal
steps in the grant procedure, and streamlining the role
of the EPO in the international phase of international
applications ﬁled under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
While these changes may not enjoy universal support
among those involved in obtaining patents, they are
at least visible. Less visible is the ‘points system’ that
the EPO employs to evaluate the performance of its
examiners. Both the widely advertised procedural
changes and the behind-the-scenes management initiat-
ives affect the EPO’s behaviour. This article seeks to
examine trends in that behaviour and in the procedural
changes to which they are linked, considering ways in
which European applications might be prosecuted most
advantageously for the applicant.

Is the EPO becoming less
applicant-friendly?
For all European patent applications ﬁled on or after 1
July 2005, and for international applications ﬁled on or
after that date that enter the regional phase in Europe
and on which the EPO is to draw up a supplementary
search report, the EPO now draws up an extended search
report that includes a detailed opinion on patentability2.
The opinion looks just like a traditional EPO examin-

ation report, but differs in requiring no set period for
ﬁling a response. The applicant may choose whether to
respond. If he does, the response is taken into account at
the examination stage, so that the ﬁrst examination
report will be in the light of the response. If he chooses
not to respond, a letter is issued at the examination stage
referring to the opinion and setting a term for respond-
ing. The rationale for this seems sensible: at the search
stage, the examiner’s familiarity with the case is such that
drawing up an opinion requires little extra work (indeed,
in some cases this was done before extended search
reports were introduced, but with the resulting opinion
remaining instead in the EPO’s ﬁle, to be reproduced
during examination as the ﬁrst examination report).
Another reason for introducing the opinion at the search
stage is to encourage applicants to drop apparently hope-
less cases sooner, or to ﬁle amendments and supporting
arguments earlier in the life of an application in the hope
of bringing forward the grant of a patent. Either way, the
effect is to remove cases from the examiner’s in-tray.

An accompanying development that also matches the
EPO’s desire to master its workload, but which has not
been advertised, is the apparent reduction in opportu-
nities during the examination stage to challenge nega-
tive ﬁndings by the examiner. Previously at least two
examination reports, perhaps even more, could conﬁ-
dently be expected before the examiner would signal, by
summoning the applicant to a hearing, that an impasse
had been reached and that he was minded to refuse a
case. Sometimes even an expectation of three or four
examination reports proved not to be over-optimistic.
Nowadays it seems, at least in some technical ﬁelds, that
the applicant cannot always expect more than one
examination report before being summoned to a
hearing. There is a resulting feeling that applicants now
enjoy fewer opportunities to place an application in
order by making written submissions at the examin-
ation stage, facing a corresponding increase in the likeli-
hood of being summoned to a hearing and incurring
the associated attorney time and cost. This practice
therefore starts to appear other than applicant-friendly.

Another reason for introducting the opinion at
the search stage is to encourage applicants to
drop apparently hopeless cases sooner

This position may be evidence of the operation of the
points system. It is known that examiners receive points
for processing cases. Since a hearing before the examiner
and his two colleagues usually concludes with a decision
either allowing or refusing the application, this is an
efﬁcient way of gaining those points. It is believed that
the examiner’s two colleagues at the hearing are also
awarded points. Perhaps setting a hearing also has the
effect of discouraging applicants, who are unable or
unwilling to bear the associated preparation time or the
(at least perceived) inconvenience associated with a
hearing, from proceeding with their applications. What-
ever the reason, the result seems in line with ‘mastering
the workload’, but not necessarily in a way that is
helpful to the applicant. In short, it seems that the
applicant now gets fewer bites of the cherry.

How then should we prosecute
European applications?
If the applicant is to get the best out of the EPO, these
changes all seem to point in one direction: the appli-
cant must move, from a position in which he is merely
reactive to objections raised by the EPO, towards a

position in which he must seek to anticipate the argu-
ments of the EPO and take the initiative in addressing
them. This shift in work from the examiner to the
applicant is necessary if the applicant is to gain satisfac-
tion from the EPO, especially when it comes to appli-
cations originating outside Europe, which may not
have been drafted speciﬁcally with EPO practice in
mind and which usually therefore require more atten-
tion during prosecution to place them in order for
acceptance.

Pre-ﬁling review
The earliest stage in the application procedure at which
action in anticipation of objections by the EPO should
ideally be taken is before ﬁling a European application
(which, for an ex-international application, also means
before ﬁling the international application, rather than
upon regional phase entry). At this stage, there can be
merit in the applicant (or, more precisely, his European
attorney) conducting a pre-ﬁling review. While a
cursory review, such as to reduce the number of claims
attracting an excess claim fee, has always been desirable,
a more thorough review may now be advantageous.

The attorney is well advised to highlight,
near the beginning of the specification, a
technical problem that the invention solves
using technical means

One clear area for review relates to independent
claims. The different requirements of US law,
for
example, usually result in a US-originating speciﬁcation
having more than one independent method claim, and/
or more than one independent apparatus claim.
Indeed, to have only one such claim could be deemed
poor practice in the US. In Europe, however, the strict
EPO rules in this area nearly always prohibit multiple
independent claims in the same category. As sub-
sequent amendment is therefore almost always needed,
it is preferable to amend the claims before ﬁling so that
amendment is not hindered by the strictly interpreted
prohibition on adding new subject matter to a Euro-
pean application after ﬁling. For example, the attorney
may seek to formulate a single independent claim that
is generic to the US-originating independent claims
and add this to the speciﬁcation as an additional claim,
a substitute claim, or a statement of invention in the
description.

The attorney might also take this opportunity to
make certain more minor changes that nevertheless

seem to ﬁnd favour with EPO examiners. These changes
include amending the statements of invention to corre-
spond to the claims and removing references that
suggest that the scope of protection is broader than that
claimed (references in the description to the ‘spirit’ of
the invention are always met with objection). It is even
thought in some quarters that removing section head-
ings throughout the speciﬁcation, to make the docu-
ment look less like one that originates from outside
Europe can put the examiner in a better frame of mind.
For this reason,
inserting reference numerals in the
claims may also be advantageous. Finally, perhaps more
for those cases that are close to the border between
patentable inventions and subject matter excluded from
patentability under European law3, the attorney would
be well advised to highlight towards the beginning of
the speciﬁcation a technical problem that the invention
solves using technical means.

Response to extended European
search reports
The next stage in the procedure where the applicant
would do well to be active rather than passive is after
the drawing-up of the extended search report. As there
is no requirement to respond to the opinion accom-
panying the search report, it is tempting to save time
and money and therefore do nothing. This, however,
can be a false economy. It may be better advice for the
applicant to elect to treat the opinion just like a ﬁrst
examination report and ﬁle an appropriate response.
As noted above, there may be only one subsequent
examination report before a summons to a hearing is
received.

In ﬁling a response to an extended search report,
just as when responding to an examination report,
the applicant is well advised to do those small things
that make it easier for the examiner to put a case
forward for grant. It may be irksome to the applicant
to insert reference numerals in the claims and to
acknowledge in the description the art found by the
examiner, but
something to be said for
giving ground where this can be done relatively easily
and without any impact on the scope of protection
claimed: perhaps the examiner will
then be more
favourably disposed to the applicant’s arguments in
more critical areas, such as those against an objection
by the examiner that the claimed invention does not
involve an inventive step (ie that it is obvious). It

methods for doing business and computer programs as not being
patentable in so far as an application relates to these things ‘as such’.

should also be understood that, when such arguments
their
are made by the applicant,
the chances of
succeeding are almost certainly maximized if
these
follow the problem-and-solution approach so beloved
of the EPO. It is therefore important to identify a
technical problem that is solved by the technical fea-
tures of difference between the claimed invention and
the closest prior art disclosure.

Auxiliary requests in response to
examination reports
No less rigorous an approach should be taken in
responding to a subsequent examination report in the
examination stage, on the prudent assumption that
there will not necessarily be a second examination
report. Should the applicant have reason to fear that
his preferred response
examination
report may not meet with success, he might consider
ﬁling one or more ‘auxiliary requests’ for consideration
in the event that his principal arguments and amend-
ments (if any) are rejected. In this way, what would
otherwise be several different responses are effectively
squeezed into one: the applicant gets more bites of
the cherry.

The run-up to oral proceedings
If the applicant should fail to overcome the examiner’s
objections and a summons to a hearing (‘oral proceed-
ings’ in EPO parlance) is issued, there are still several
things that the applicant can do to increase his chances
of obtaining a good result.

Although it is common for a hearing to be appointed
with less notice than would be given for responding to
an examination report, the applicant should seek to
avoid waiting until the last minute before ﬁling the ﬁnal
submissions that he may ﬁle up to one month before the
date appointed for the hearing. If these are ﬁled in good
time, or perhaps even if they are ﬁled at the last minute,
the examiner should be contacted and his views on the
ﬁnal submissions sought. It may be that something can
be agreed before the hearing and that the hearing can
therefore be cancelled. Alternatively, a view can be taken
by the applicant, based on the examiner’s reaction to the
ﬁnal submissions, as to whether it seems worthwhile to
appear at the hearing and argue the case. If it appears to
be a desperate case, the applicant may decide to avoid
the added expense of being represented at the hearing,
cancel the hearing and instead request a decision based

on the papers, which would be subject to appeal. He may
instead let the hearing proceed in his absence and arrive
at an appealable decision that way.

Look at what you’ve won
While it seems that the points system adopted at the
EPO and the changes to the way in which the EPO
handles applications are bringing the EPO closer to its
coveted prize of mastery of its workload, advantages
for the applicant are harder to identify. The EPO
would no doubt cite the goal of quicker grant as being
of great value to applicants, even though expedited
processing of applications has long been available.4 Of

concern though is the reduction in opportunities that
an applicant has to put a case in order and the
increased likelihood of being summoned to a hearing.
Even so, a desirable result can still be gained from this
new regime if a more proactive approach than has been
usual is adopted. It may even be that, by adopting this
approach, there can be overall cost savings in reducing
the number of responses while still obtaining a com-
mercially useful patent. Perhaps there is a prize then
for the applicant after all.
