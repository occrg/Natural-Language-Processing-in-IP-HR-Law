Network Copyright Rules in the People’s 

Republic of China 

Chiang Ling LI* 

Since the People’s Republic of China (PRc) was formally linked to the Internet in 
1994, the Internet market in the PRC has  developed at a tremendous speed. The July 
2001  Survey Report  of  the  PRC’S Internet  information centre-the  China  Internet 
Network Information Center (C”1C)showed 
that there were more than 10 d i o n  
computers in the PRC which were networked and that there were more than 26 d o n  
Netizens who spent one hour or more each week on the Internet.’  According to the 
China State Information Office’s survey, announced on 7 September 2001, as at 30 April 
2001 there were  more  than 0.2  million Websites and  159 million Web  pages  in the 
PRC.~ The survey also showed that 67 percent of the Websites had been established since 
2000 and that 42 percent of such Websites were set up in 2000. In their market research 
report entitled The Znternet in China, BDA (China) Ltd. and The Strategis Group forecast 
that the PRC wdl become one of the world’s largest Internet markets as early as in 2003. 
However,  copyright  and  other  infiingements  on  the  Net  are  also  rapidly 
developing, and these will have a significant impact on the PRC copyright regulatory 
regime.3 

The primary laws and regulations governing copyright protection in the PRC are 
the  Copyright  Law  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (hereider  “the  current 
Copyright Law” or “the 2001 Copyright Law”)4 and the Detailed Implementing Rules 
of the Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China (Implementing Rules).5

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

The  Regulations  for  the  Implementation  of  International  Copyright  Treaties 
(International  Treaty  Regulations)6  were  formulated  to  implement  international 
copyright treaties of which the PRC is a Member.’ The PRC is a Member of the Berne 
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Universal Copyright 
Convention,  and  the  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Producers  of  Phonograms 
Against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms. 

The PKC courts have recently adjudicated on a number of network infringement 
cases  and the  Supreme People’s Court of the PRC has  issued  a judicial interpretation 
entitled  the  Interpretation  Regarding  Various  Issues  on  the  Applicable  Law  for 
Adjudicating Disputes relating to Computer Network Copyrights (Network Copyright 
1nterpretation)g addressing network copyright infringement and related issues. 

The Copyright Law was recently revised, and among the important revisions are 

those relating to the Internet. 

It must be noted at the outset that the concept of stare  decisis does not exist in the 
PRC, and  previous  court  decisions  are  not  binding  on  subsequent  actions.  It  is 
nevertheless useful to look into the various network cases to understand the new body 
of rules governing network copyright and related issues. This article looks at these new 
rules and at cases. 

INFRINGEMENT 
I.  COPYRIGHT 
A.  THE PREVIOUS COPYRIGHT LAW 

The previous Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter “the 
1990 Copyright Law”)9 did not  specifically deal with  activities on the Net  although, 
arguably, it applied to such activities. 

“Copyright”  was  defined  in  the  1990  Copyright  Law  to  include  the  right  of 
publication, the right of attribution, the right of revision, the right of integrity and the 
right to exploit one’s work and to receive remuneration therefor.’” The right to exploit 
one’s work  and to receive remuneration therefor was  defined in the  1990 Copyright 
Law  as the right to use one’s work through  reproduction, performance, broadcasting, 
exhibition,  distribution,  production  through  cinematization,  televising  or  video 
recordmg,  adaptation, translation,  annotation,  editing,  etc.,  and  the  right  to  license 

The Regulations  for the Implementation  of International  Copyright Treaties, promulgated  by  the State 

Council of the PRC on 25 September 1992, and effective from 30 September 1992.

The Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China, adopted at the Fifteenth Meeting of the Standing 
Committee of the Seventh National People’s Congress of the PRC on 7 September 1990, and effective &om 1 June

others to use one’s work in the above-mentioned ways and to receive remuneration for 
granting such licences.11 The terms in the above definitions are italicized for the sole 
purpose  of  drawing attention  to  them  here.  Such  terms  seem  to  inchcate that  the 
definition was not an exhaustive one, but an inclusive one. The other types of rights, 
such as ones relating to the dissemination of works on the Internet were, arguably, also 
protected as copyright. 

It  may  as  well be  argued that  Article 45(5) and  (8) of the  1990 Copyright Law 
seemed also to contemplate infringing acts other than the ones specifically set out in that 
Article because of the terms italicized below: 

“Article 4 5  Anyone who commits any of the following infringing acts shall undertake civil 
liability by  ceasing the  infringement,  eliminating the  effects, making  a public  apology, 
paying damages, etc., depending on the circumstances: 
... 
(5)  unless  this  Law  provides  otherwise,  use  of  a  work  in  ways  such  as  performing, 
broadcasting,  exhibiting,  distributing,  making  a  fdm,  television  programme  or  video 
recording,  adapting, translating, annotating  or  editing,  etc.,  without  permission from  the 
copyright owner; 

(8) other infringements of copyright and neighboring rights.” 
Article 46(1) and (2) of the 1990 Copyright Law stipulated as follows: 
“Article 46: Anyone who commits any of the following torts shall undertake civil liability by 
ceasing  the  i&ngement,  eliminating  the  effects,  making  a  public  apology  or  paying 
damages, etc.,  depending  on  the  circumstances, and  may  in  addition be  subjected by  a 
copyright administration department to such penalties as confiscation of unlawful income 
or the imposition of fines: 
1.  plagiarizing of another’s work; 
2. 

reproduction and distribution of a work in pursuit of profit, without permission from 
the owner of the copyright;” 

It may be argued that “plagarizing” (in Article 46(1)) of a work may be applicable 

in the Net environment. 

“Reproduction”  (in Article 46(2)) is  defined  in  Article  5  of the  Implementing 
Rules  as  the  production  of  one  or  more  copies  of  a  work  by  means  of printing, 
photocopying, copying, malung a rubbing, makmg a sound recordmg, malung a video 
recordmg, duplicating a  recording, re-photographing,  re-filming,  etc.  Because of the 
word  “etc.” in the definition, the definition is a non-exhaustive  one.  It may  again be 
argued that the copying of a work in the Net environment, including copying a work 
fiom one Website onto another, posting a work  onto  a  Website and downloading a 
work fiom a Website, falls within the definition of reproduction. 

184 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

“Distribution” (in Article 46(2)) is defined in the same Article 5 as  the supply to 
the public of a certain quantity of reproductions of a work by means of sale, rental, etc., 
in order to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public. Again, because of the word 
“etc.” in the definition, the definition is a non-exhaustive one. It may again be argued 
that the dssemination of a work on the Net is one mode of distribution of the work. 
The counterargument to the above arguments that the  1990 Copyright Law was 
applicable in the  Net  environment because of the inclusive terms used  was  that  the 
network rights are so different from the rights specifically listed, and the use on the Net 
environment is so different from the other modes of use listed in the various provisions, 
that the network rights and uses should not fall within the scope of application of the 
1990 Copyright Law. The inclusive terms, arguably, were supposed to comprise items 
simdar to the ones specifically set forth in the various provisions. 

The  applicability  of  the  1990  Copyright  Law  to  activities  on  the  Net  was, 

therefore, debatable and uncertain. 

B. 

INTERNATIONAL TREATIES 

The PRC took an active interest in the World Intellectual Property Organization 
Copyright  Treaty  (WCT)  and  the  World  Intellectual  Property  Organization 
Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), both adopted by the WIPO Diplomatic 
Conference on Certain Copyright and Neighboring Rights Questions held in Geneva 
on 20 December 1996, and the Agreed Statements concerning these two Treaties. As 
will be seen below, the Regulations for Copyrights in Digital Products (Digital Product 
Regulation) ,I2  the Network Copyright Interpretation and the current Copyright Law 
have incorporated principles from these two Treaties and the Agreed Statements, and it 
seems that the PRC courts have also taken notice of them in their adjudication of various 
network cases. 

The PRC became a Member of the World Trade Organization in December 2001 
and thus committed itself to implementing the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The PRC had already signed TRIPS, but was not 
obliged to  implement its provisions before actually entering the WTO. The PRC has 
taken TRIPS compliance issues into account in its revision of the 1990 Copyright Law. 

C.  THE DIGITAL  PRODUCT  REGULATION 

On 9 December 1999, the National Copyright Administration (NcA), the national 
authority responsible for copyright administration in the PRC, issued the Digital Product 
Regulation. The Regulation applies to works protected by the Copyright Law which 

‘2  The Regulations  for Copyrights  in Digital  Products, Document  No.  Guoquan  [1999] 45,  effective  on 

1 March 2000.

have been  digitized and fured in tangible material form, includmg CDs, LDs, VCDS, 
DVDS, FDs,  CD-ROMS, CD-Is,  Photo-CDs,  DVD-ROMS and  ICCards.13  The 
Regulation  states  that  the  dlgitization  of  works  into  digital  products  constitutes 
reproduction  of  the  works,  and  authorization from  the  copyright  owner  must  be 
obtained for the digitization, otherwise it is inhngement.14 

The position of the Digital Product Regulation seems consistent with the position 
of  the  Agreed  Statements  concerning  Article  l(4)  of  the  WCT and  the  Agreed 
Statements concerning Articles 7, 11 and 16 of the WPPT, which state that the right of 
reproduction hlly applies in the digital environment and that the storage of a protected 
work in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes a reproduction. 

The China Copyright Protection Center-a 

body set up by the PRC government 
for  handling  copyright  management  and  services-issued 
the  Provisional  Standard 
Copyright User  Fees  for  the  Production of Digital Products, effective  1 July  2000, 
which is stated to be primarily applicable to CD-ROM products. The Standard sets out, 
for reference purposes, the different ways  of calculating licence fees with respect to a 
reproduction or publication of digital works. 

D.  COURT CASES 

Various  network  cases  came  before  the  PRC courts  immedately  before  the 
Copyright Law was revised. A number of defendants raised the argument that the 1990 
Copyright Law was silent on the prohibition of copyright inhngement on the Net. The 
courts struggled with the issue of whether the  1990 Law was applicable to such cases. 
The following is a discussion of some of those cases. 

1.  Chen v. Chendu Computer Commercial Information  Newspaper PublisherlS 

The plaintiff, Chen Weihua, wrote an article entitledjoking about MAYA on 10 May 
1998. Chen posted the article, under the pseudonym Wufang, onto his Website called 
“3D  Sesame  Street”  with  the  address  cchttp://www.nease.net/-xmchang/3ds)) 
(cchttp://www3d.yeah.net))). The defendant, on 16 October 1998, published the article 
in  its  fortieth issue  of the  Computer  Commercial Information Journal  without  the 
authorization of the plaintiff. 

The plaintiff commenced a lawsuit against the defendant at the Beijing Municipal 
Haidian District People’s Court asking the Court to find copyright infiingement, and 
to order the defendant to issue a public apology and pay a contribution fee in the sum

of F W B  231 (approximately US$ 28) and punitive damages in the sum of RMB 50,000 
(approximately US$ 6,098). 

An excerpt from the Court’s decision states as follows: 
“The article has  the  originality required  of  works protected  by  copyright. The article in 
digital form was capable of being fixed onto the hard drive of a computer, capable of being 
transmitted onto the Internet  through the mvww)) server, capable of maintaining a stable 
status, and capable ofbeing accessed and reproduced by the public with the assistance of the 
mainframe of the Net. The article is therefore protected by the [1990] Copyright Law. 
Under  Article  11  of  the  [I9901  Copyright  Law,  absent  evidence  to  the  contrary,  the 
individual or entity that puts his  or her name on a work is  to be  considered the author of 
the work.  The registrant of the Website, i.e.  the  plaintiff, and the  article both  used  the 
pseudonyni “Wufang”. Furthermore, the plaintiff was able to demonstrate to the Court that 
he was able to change the password to the Website, post documents onto the Website, and 
modify documents on the site. The defendant also conceded authorship of the article to the 
plaintiff. The plaintiff should therefore be held to be the author of the article. 
The posting of the article on the  Internet by the plaintiff is  dissemination of his work in 
cyberspace. The publishing of the same article in the defendant’s Journal is further making 
the article available to the public. Such publication by the defendant without the plaintiffs 
authorization is infringement of the plaintiffs copyright.” 
The Court issued an injunction against the defendant and ordered the defendant to 
issue  a public  apology and pay  compensation  to the plaintiff.  The Court refused  the 
plaintiffs  claim  for  the b m  50,000 punitive  damages  as  the  Court  found that  the 
plaintiff  did not substantiate the claim with evidence. The Court awarded the plaintiff 
a total of M 924 (approximately US$ 113) compensation, plus a case acceptance feel6 
of RMB 2,017 (approximately US$ 246). 

This  case,  besides  being  instructive  on  a  number of substantive issues, provides 
guidance o n  how a party may show that he or she is the author of a work in cases where 
the work is an anonymous or a pseudonymous one.

This  is  one  of  six  almost  identical  cases  where  six  prominent  PRC novelists, 

16  There are generally six different types of court costs which may be payable by litigants in the PRC. The most 

important of the court costs is the case acceptance fee.

Wang  Meng,  Zhang Jie,  Bi  Shumin,  Zhang  Kangkang,  Zhang  Chengzhi  and  Liu 
Zhenyu, commenced actions against the same defendant for copyright inhngement. 

The defendant copied the plaintiffs novel from a third-party Website onto its own 
Website  cthttp://www.bol.com.cnn,  well  known  in  the  PRC, without  the  plaintiffs 
authorization.  The plaintiff  commenced  litigation  on  15 June  1999 at  the  Beijing 
Municipal  Haidan  District  People’s  Court,  aslung  the  Court  to  find  copyright 
inhngement and order the defendant to stop the infringement, issue a public apology 
and pay compensation. 

The defendant pointed out that the 1990 Copyright Law did not stipulate how to 
use  a  third-party’s  work  on  the  Internet,  whether  authorization was  required  and 
whether  compensation must  be  paid  in  such instances, and  that  it  therefore did  not 
know that it must obtain authorization prior to using the novels. 

The following is an excerpt from the Court’s decision: 
“Digitization of a work only changes the material form in which the work is fured and the 
mode of use  of the work, and does not involve any original creation or the creation of a 
new work. The copyright owner of the work still owns the copyright of the work in digital 
form.  The  digital  form  of  the  plaintiffs  novel  downloaded  by  the  defendant from  the 
Internet is not a new work, but its copyright remains vested in the plaintiff 
The list  of rights set out in Article  lO(5) of the  [I9901 Copyright Law  [set out  above at 
footnote 101 is not exhaustive. With the development of technology and the emergence of 
new  media  in which  works may  be  fured, the  scope of use  of works is  expanded. The 
dissemination of works on the Internet  is  one mode of use  of the works. The copyright 
owner has the right to decide whether to disseminate his or her work on the Internet. Third 
parties must obtain authorization from the  copyright owner for disseminating his  or her 
work through whatever means. Although there are differences between the dissemination 
of works on the Internet and the dissemination through traditional channels, the different 
modes  of  dissemination in  substance are  to  achieve the  same  goal  of making the  work 
available to the public. The different modes of dissemination do not affect the right of the 
copyright owner to control the dissemination of his or her work. The dissemination of the 
plaintiffs work  on the Internet without  authorization is an infringement of the plaintiffs 
copyright.” 

The decision in the case was issued  on  18 September 1999. The Court issued an 
injunction, and ordered the defendant to issue  a public apology and pay compensation 
of RMI3  1,680 (approximately US$  205), litigation fees  of RMI3  166 (approximately 
US$20) and a case acceptance fee of RMB 330 (approximately US$ 40). As the plaintiff 
did not provide evidence on his loss or on how many times his work was visited or 
downloaded from the defendant’s Website, the Court &d not award the compensation 
sought by  the plaintiff but based  the  amount  of the  compensation on various factors 
includmg the duration and the seriousness of the infiingement. The Court refused the 
plaintiffs claim for RMB 5,000 (approximately US$610) for psychological damage, as it 
found that the action of the defendant did not infringe the moral rights of the plaintiff 
and did not lower the public esteem for the plaintifE 

188 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

The  defendant appealed the  decision to  Beijing Municipal No.  1 Intermediate 
People’s  Court  arguing that  the  1990 Copyright Law  did  not  address  the  issue  of 
disseminating works on the Internet. The defendant argued that legal issues relating to 
the dissemination of information on the Internet should be addressed through legislative 
reform  or  through  the  Supreme Court’s judicial interpretation rather  than  through 
judicial  activism by  the  lower  courts.  The  defendant  argued  that  without  explicit 
stipulation in  law, the  Court  of First  Instance had  extended copyright protection to 
dissemination on the Net. 

The Appeal Court issued a  decision on  17 December 1999 confirming that the 
plaintiff still enjoyed copyright of the digital version of his work copied by the defendant 
from the Internet. Although the  1990 Copyright Law  did not specifically address the 
issue of use  of works on the Net, such use  was still governed by the Law. The use  of 
works on the Net is  one type of use  of works and the user must obtain authorization 
from the copyright owner. The defendant had a responsibility for the copyright of the 
contents of its Website. Although the work was  obtained by  the defendant from the 
Internet, the defendant was technically able to control the further dlssemination of such 
information. The Appeal Court therefore  upheld  the  decision of the  Court  of First 
Instance. 

The  position  that  the  digital  version  of  a  work  was  not  a  new  work  and  its 
copyright still  belonged  to  the  copyright  owner  of  the  original work  and  that  the 
dlssemination of a work on the Internet is one mode of use  of the work was perhaps 
expected in view of the Digital Product Regulation. 

3.  Beijing  Chuanglian Communication  Network  Co., Ltd. v. Beijing  Huimeng 

Znternational Business  Consulting  Co., Ltd. (Beijing Chuanglian Case)l* 

The  plaintiff  claimed  that  the  defendant  copied  the  designs  of  certain  of  the 
plaintiffs Web pages for use on the defendant’s Website. The plaintiff also claimed that 
the defendant’s Website copied the designs and the contents of the advertisements on 
the plaintiffs Website. The plaintiff furthermore claimed that the defendant’s Website 
copied the online domain-name registration feedback form featured on the plaintiffs 
Website. The defendant also  engaged in false, below-cost  advertising with respect to 
domain-name registration fees on its Website and in other advertisements. 

The  plaintiff  commenced  litigation  at  the  Beijing  Municipal  Haidlan  District 
People’s  Court,  asking the  Court  to  issue  an  injunction and  order the  defendant to 
500,000 (approximately US$60,976) 
apologize and pay compensation in the sum of- 
plus enforcement expenses. The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiff for unfair 
competition in dsseminating information on the litigation to the media.

PRC NETWORK COPYRIGHT RULES 

189 

The Court issued a decision on 20 February 2000, rejecting the plaintiffs claim that 
the defendant infringed its copyright in the designs of its Web pages and in the designs 
and contents of the advertisements on its Website. The Court found that the plaintiff 
was not  able to prove that the plaintiff was  the original designer of the designs  of the 
advertisements. The Court found that the similarity in the designs of the Web pages and 
contents of the advertisements was due to both the plaintiff and defendant being in the 
same industry and, therefore, using the same technical terms and advertising the same 
types of services. 

However,  the  Court found  that  the  defendant copied the  domain-name online 
registration feedback form in violation of the plaintiffs copyright. The Court also found 
that the defendant’s false, below-cost  advertising constituted unfair competition under 
Article  ll(1)  of  the  Law  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  against  Unfair 
Competition19 (Unfair  Competition  Law)  which  prohibits  business  operators  from 
selling merchandise below cost for the purpose of forcing out competitors. 

The Court ordered the defendant to take down the copied work, cease the false 
advertising, issue a public apology with respect to the copyright infnngement, and pay 
compensation in the sum of RMB 30,000 (approximately US$  3,659) with  respect to 
copynght  infnngement  and RMB 10,000 (approximately US$  1,220) with  respect  to 
unfair competition. The defendant was also ordered to bear the plaintiffs enforcement 
expenses. 

The defendant’s counterclaim was rejected by the Court.

well-known Website in the PRC, into its publication without the authorization of the

The Court issued a decision on 1 December 2000, and took the position that the 
use of works from the Net was governed by the 1990 Law. The Court found copyright 
infringement, issued  an injunction against  the publication, distribution and sale of the 
infringing publication, ordered the plaintiff to issue a public apology and awarded to the 
plaintiff the requested compensation of R M B  10,001 plus the case acceptance fee. 

The defendant appealed the ruling to the Beijing Municipal High People’s Court. 
The parties settled under the auspices of the Court in June 2001. The defendant agreed 
to immediately cease the publication and distribution of the intiinging publication, issue 
a written apology to the plaintiff and pay the RMB 10,001 compensation requested plus 
the case acceptance fees for the Court of First Instance and the Appeal Court. 

E.  SOFTWARE 

Computer programs are a protected subject-matter under the Copyright Law. The 
primary laws  and regulations governing software protection  in the PRC are the 2001 
Copyright  Law,  the  Implementing Rules,  the  International  Treaty  Regulation,  the 
Regulations for  the  Protection  of  Computer  Software,21 and  the  Measures  for  the 
Registration of Copyright in Computer Software.22 The following case also dealt with 
software copyright infiingement on the Net.

granted the second plaintiff a copyright licence with respect to the user interface designs, 
and specific Web page contents, etc. of the site. 

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant copied three articles on advertising posted 
on  their  Website  onto  its  own  Website,  (<http://tonight.com.cnii. The  plaintiffs 
hrthermore claimed that the defendant revised one of its Web pages entitled “Set Up 
as  a Home Page”, and then used  the revised page  on its own Website. The plaintiffs 
claimed that the content (which was a user manual) and the hypertext markup language 
(html) source code for that Web page were copied by the defendant’s Website. 

The plaintiffs commenced litigation against the  defendant at Beijing Municipal 
No.  2  People’s Court,  asking the  Court  to  find  copyright inhngement  and  unfiir 
competition, issue an injunction, order the defendant to issue a public apology, and pay 
compensation and litigation expenses. 

In relation  to  the  three  articles on advertising, the plaintiffs submitted evidence 
showing that the three articles were being displayed on their Website and that simdar 
articles  were  being  displayed on  the  defendant’s Website.  The defendant  submitted 
evidence showing that  similar articles had  previously been  displayed on Websites of 
third parties. The Court acknowledged that electronic documentation might easily be 
tampered  with.  The  Court,  however,  was  of  the  view  that  the  available  evidence 
showed that on the day that the plaintiffs published the articles on their Website, third 
parties also published similar articles on their Websites. The Court therefore found that 
the plaintiffs did not prove that they were the copyright owners of the three articles. 

O n  the issue of the copying of the Web page, a relevant excerpt &om the Court’s 

decision states: 

that  of  ((http://sina.com.cn)>.  However, 

“Although the subject-matter of the contents of the Web page is commonly used by Websites, 
original works based on the same subject-matter  are protected  under the Copyright Law. 
The expressions by other Websites with respect to the same subject-matter may be different. 
The expressions by Yahoo’s and Sohu’s Websites with respect to the same subject-matter are 
the  expression  used  by 
different  from 
((http://tonight.com.cn)) and that used by ((http://sina.com.cm  are basically identical. 
The ‘Set Up as a Home Page’ Web page written in Hypertext Markup Language source code 
is protected by copyright under the Regulation for the Protection of Computer Software. 
The ‘Set Up as a Home Page’ Web page in the defendant’s Website is similar to the ‘Set Up 
as a Home Page’ Web page of the plaintif%  Website. The defendant has therefore infringed 
the copyright of the plaintiffs.” 
The Court took the position that as the issues relating to the “Set Up as a Home 
Page” Web page were dealt with by way of copyright protection, they should not be 
the subject of protection under the Unfair Competition Law.24

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

The defendant seemed to have tampered with  certain e-mail  evidence submitted 
to the Court. The Court admonished the defendant but, however, considered that as 
the evidence was not critical to the case, it would not take further measures against the 
defendant in that regard. 

The  Court  stated  that  it  was  difficult  to  measure  the  consequences and  losses 
suffered as  a result  of copyright infringement on the  Net.  The plaintiffs also  did not 
adduce evidence in support of their loss. The Court granted remedies based on various 
factors, including the seriousness of the infringement and reasonable expenses incurred 
by the plaintiffs. 

As the defendant, at the time ofthe decision, had already amended the contents and 
source code with  respect to the Web page  to a version agreeable to the plaintiffs, the 
Court decided not to issue an injunction against the defendant in this regard. 

Basing its decision on Article 46(1) of the 1990 Copyright Law and Articles 3 and 
30(6) of the Regulation for the Protection of Computer Software, the Court ordered 
the defendant to issue a written apology and pay compensation in the sum of RMB 8,000 
(approximately US$ 976) and a certain portion of the enforcement expenses. 

Article 46(1) of the Copyright Law is set out above in Section LA.  Article 3 of the 
Regulations for  the  Protection  of Computer  Software defines various terms used  in 
those  Regulations, 
and 
“reproduction”. Article 30(6) stipulates as follows: 

including  “computer  program”, 

“documentation” 

“Article 3 0  . . . anyone who commits any of the following infringing acts shall undertake civil 
liability by  ceasing  the  infringement,  eliminating the  effects, making  a  public  apology, 
paying damages, etc., depending on the circumstances; in addition, the national software 
copyright  administration  department  may  impose  such  administrative  penalties  as 
confiscation of the unlawful income, imposition of a fine, etc.: 
... 
(6) reproduction or partial reproduction of a work of software without permission from the 
software copyright owner or his lawful assignee;” 
Revision of the Regulations for the Protection of Computer Software is currently 

being considered. 

F.  THE NETWORK  COPYRIGHT INTERPRETATION 

Faced with the various network cases, the Supreme Court, on 22 November 2000, 
issued  the  Network  Copyright  Interpretation. Judicial interpretations issued  by  the 
Supreme Court are, in general, binding on the lower courts. According to the Several 
Regulations  of  the  Supreme  People’s  Court  Concerning  Judicial  Interpretation, 
Supreme Court judicial interpretations carry legal force. 

The Interpretation  sets  out important  rules  with  respect  to  network  copyright 

PRC NETWORK COPYRIGHT RULES 

193 

infringement cases. Article 1 stipulates that the court at the “place of infiingement” or 
at the place of residence of the inhnger is to have jurisdiction in a network copyright 
dispute case.  The  “place  of infhngement”  includes  the  place  where  the  server, the 
computer terminal or other equipment which has been used in the committing of the 
offence is located.25 If it is difficult to identify the place of infhngement or the place of 
residence of the infringer, the place where the computer terminal or other equipment 
from which the plaintiff discovered the infirngement is located is to be deemed the place 
of infringement.26 

Article 9 of the Interpretation specifies the applicable provisions of the Copyright 
Law for the different network copyright infringement cases. Article 46(1), (2), (3) and 
(4) of the 2001 Copyright Law-which 
sets out the  civil liability with  respect to the 
publication of a work without authorization from the owner, the affixing of one’s name 
to another’s work in pursuit of fame and profit and the distortion and mutilation of a 
to be applied to an infringement of moral rights on the Net. Article 4616) of 
work-is 
the 2001 Copyright Law, which sets out the civil liability with respect to the use of a 
work without authorization, is to be applied to an unauthorized dissemination on the 
Net. Article 46(7), which sets out the civil liability with respect to the use of another’s 
work without paying compensation, is to be applied to the infringement of the right to 
compensation in the Net environment. Article 46(11), which sets out the civil liability 
with  respect  to  “other  infringements”,  is  to  be  applied  to  the  infiingement  of 
neighboring rights or infirngement as a result of the deliberate removal or alteration of 
rights  management  information  applied  for  the  protection  of  works  in  the  Net 
environment.  The  civil  liability  and  administrative  penalties  with  respect  to  the 
plagiarizing  of  another’s  work  are  to  be  applied  to  such  plagiarizing  in  the  Net 
environment. 

Article 2 of the Interpretation states that works in digtal form are protected by the 
Copyright Law.  The same Article further states that courts should also give protection 
to other intellectual creations, which although unable to fit within the scope of works 
listed in the Copyright Law in the Net environment, do possess originality in the realms 
of literature, art or science and are capable of being reproduced in some tangible fom.27 

25  The Network Copyright Interpretation, supra, footnote 8, Article  1 
26  Id. 
27  The works listed in Article 3 of the 1990 Copyright Law (supra, footnote 9) are: written works; oral works; 
musical  works,  operatic  and  dramatic works; works  of quyi  and  choreographic works;  works  of fine  art  and 
photographic works; cinematographic, television and video-graphic works; drawings of engineering designs and 
drawings of product  designs, and their explanations; works in the form of drawings such as maps and schematic 
drawings; computer software; and other works as stipulated in laws and administrative regulations. “Works of Quyi” 
is  defined in  Article  4(5) of the  Implementing  Rules  (supra, footnote 5) as  works  mainly  performed  through 
storytelling and ballad singing, such as comic dlalogues, quick-patter, versified stones sung to the accompaniment 
of a small drum and other instruments, storytelling, etc. The works listed in Article 3 of the 2001 Copyright Law 
are: written works; oral works; musical works, operatic and dramatic works; works of quyi, choreographic works 
and acrobatic work, works of fine art and architectural works; photographic works; cinematographic works and 
works produced  similarly; drawings of engineering  designs and  drawings  of product  designs, maps,  schematic 
drawings and other works in the form of drawings and models; computer sohare; and other works as stipulated 
in laws and administrative regulations. 

194 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

The Article further states that the provisions in Article 10 of the  1990 Copyright Law 
(discussed above) on the various rights covered by copyright are applicable to copyright 
in digital works. The dissemination of a work to the public through the Net is a mode 
of use of the work protected under the Copyright Law?* The copyright owner enjoys 
the right to use, or license another to use, the work in such a mode and the right to be 
compensated therefor.29 

The positions  adopted by  Courts  in  the  cases  referred  to  above  seem  to  be  in 
accordance with  the position set out in Article 2.  This is, perhaps, no surprise, as  the 
Courts have probably consulted the Supreme Court on such cases. 

Furthermore, Article 2 basically incorporated the principle under Article 8 of the 
WCT and Articles 10 and  14 of the WPPT. Article 8 of the WCT states that authors of 
literary and artistic works are to: 

“. . . enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing any communication to the public of their works, 
by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in 
such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time 
individually chosen by them.” 
Article 10 of the WPPT states that: 
“Performers shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing the making available to the public 
of their performances fixed in phonograms, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that 
members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by 
them.” 
Article 14 of the WPPT states that: 
“Producers of phonograms shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing the making available 
to the public of their phonograms, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members 
of the public may access them &om a place and at a time individually chosen by them.” 
Article 3 of the Network Copyright Interpretation states that it is not an inftlngement 
for a Website to re-disseminate or excerpt a work  that has  already been published in a 
newspaper  or  periodical  or  disseminated  on  the  Net  if  the  source  is  cited  and 
compensation  is  paid  unless  there  is  a  declaration  prohibiting  re-dsseminating  and 
excerpting. It is an inhngement  if  the re-disseminated or excerpted work  exceeds  the 
scope of the work previously published or disseminated20 It is not specified whether the 
previous publishing or dssemination must be authorized, although that should be the case. 
Under Article 32 of the 1990 Copyright Law, a work which has been printed by a 
newspaper or  periodical may  be  reprinted,  or printed  as  an  abstract  or as  reference 
material, by  another newspaper or periodical, unless the copyright owner has declared 
that reprinting or excerpting is not permitted; however, the copyright owner must be

remunerated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  regulations.31  In  the  Wang  v.  Beijing 
Cenpok  Intercom  Technology Co.  case  (referred to above at footnote  17), the defendant 
argued that its further dissemination of the plaintiffs work on the Internet should not 
require  authorization  fi-om  the  plaintiff  but  should  only  involve  the  payment  of 
contribution  fees  to  the  plaintiff. As  shown  above,  the  Beijing  Municipal Haidian 
District People’s Court and the Beijing Municipal No. 1 People’s Court disagreed and 
found that the defendant must obtain authorization fiom the plaintiff prior to hrther 
dsseminating the work through the Internet. It appears from the facts of the case that 
the initial dissemination on the Net was not authorized by the plaintiff copyright owner. 
It is  not  specified in the facts whether  there was  a  declaration prohibiting reprinting 
accompanying the author’s original, legitimate publication. 

G.  THE CURRENT COPYRIGHT LAW 

The 2001 Copyright Law has introduced the “right to communicate information 
through the Net” as one of the rights within the definition of “copyright”.32 This right 
is defined as the communication to the public of works, by wire or wireless means, in 
such a way that members of the public may access the works fiom a place and at a time 
individually chosen by them.33 Again, this is taking Article 8 of the WCT into account. 
Article 37(6) of the current  Law specifically provides that a performer has the right 
to license a third party to disseminate his or her performance to the public through the 
Net and obtain licence fees therefi-om. Article 41 stipulates that a producer of audio or 
visual products has the right to license a third party to disseminate his or her products 
to the public through the Net and obtain licence fees therefi-om. 

It  is  an  infringement  to  exercise  these  rights without  the  authorization of the 

copyright owner.34 

These new provisions have been drafted taking the WPPT and TRIPS into account. 

H.  COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE ON THE NET 

The difficulty of collecting evidence in network copyright infringement cases has 
been cited as being an important reason that a very small portion of the infringers have 
been brought to justice.35 

Under Article 63 of the Civil Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of China,36 
the types of permissible evidence that litigants may  present to court are documentary 

31  This stipulation is  not changed in the 2001 Copyright Law.

evidence,  physical  evidence,  audio-visual  material,  live  testimony  of  witnesses, 
statements by interested parties, expert conclusions and notes of inquest. 

Article 67 of the  Civil Procedure Law stipulates that a  court is  to take legal acts, 
legal  facts  and  documents  notarized  pursuant  to  legal  procedures  as  a  basis  for 
ascertaining facts, except where contrary evidence is sufficient to invalidate the notarial 
certification. 

To note is that under the Provisional Regulations on Notarization of the People’s 
Republic of China, issued and effective on 13 Apnl  1982, notarization is  defined as a 
verification of both the authenticity and the legality ofjuridical acts and documents and 
facts with legal effects by  the State notarial organs in order to protect public property 
and legitimate interests, status and proprietary rights of citizens. Notarization by a PRC 
notary public  is  therefore not  only  a  verification  of the  authenticity but  also  of the 
legality of the subject-matter being notarized. 

On 29 A p d  1994, the PRC Ministry of Justice and the NCA issued a joint notice 
on making full use of notarization in investigating and handling copyright infnngement 
cases37  which  requires  that  evidence  submitted  to  administrative  enforcement 
authorities  in  copyright  infhngement  cases  should  be  notarized.  This  requirement, 
however, has not been strictly enforced in recent years. 

There  is,  nevertheless, s t d  a  strong preference  in  the  PRC for  evidence  to  be 
notarized by  PRC notary publics.  It  seems  that  both  plaintiffs and  defendants in  the 
various network cases have also relied strongly on notarized evidence. An dustration of 
how a plaintiff relied on notarized evidence in a network  copyright infhngement case 
may be seen in the following case. 

Zhang v. Jiancha Journal  Publishing  House38 

The plaintiff, Zhang Xiaohui, on 24 December  1998, posted two articles entitled 
Has  Anything  Happened  in  the  Year the  Government  Got  Connected  to  the  Net?  and  The 
Current  Chinese Legal System onto the Website ~(http://www.lawfirm5OO.com.cn)~. The 
first article was a pseudonymous work, using the pseudonym “He Ming R i  Xin”, and 
the second article was an anonymous work. The defendant edited the two articles and 
published them  in  the  13 January  1999 issue  of its journal  and in the January  1999 
edition of the online version of its newspaper at ((http://www.jerb.corn.cn)), identi6ing

the  authors  as  “He  Ming  Ri  Xin”  and  “Badai”  (which  was  the  name  of  the 
administrator of the Website c~http://www.lawfirm500.com.cn~~). 

The plaintiff, on 28 April 1999, commenced a suit at the Beijing Municipal No. 1 
Intermediate People’s Court for copyright infiingernent, requesting the Court to issue 
an injunction, and order the defendant to issue a public apology and pay a contribution 
fee of RMB 60 (approximately US$ 7). 

In support of the plaintiffs case, the plaintiff arranged for the process of accessing the 
two articles at the defendant’s Website notarized by a PRC notary public before litigation. 
The defendant argued that as the plaintiff did not provide his name and contact details 
with the articles, it was therefore unable to contact the plaintiff for authorization, etc. As 
the plaintiffdid not notarize the articles on the Website ~~http://www.lawfii500.com.cn~~, 
it  made  it &fficult  to  dispute such argument advanced by  the  defendant. In fact,  if the 
plaintiff had arranged such a notarization, the plaintiff would have notarized evidence of the 
time when the plaintiff first published the articles on the Internet, and if in fact there were 
accompanying prohibition statements stating that the articles may not be reproduced by any 
means. As  such a notarization was not conducted, it was difficult to ascertain such facts. 

The defendant also pointed out in this case that the 1990 Copyright Law &d not 
explicitly stipulate whether  its  actions were  copyright infringement. The defendant, 
however, had publicly apologized to  the plaintiff prior to the  commencement of the 
litigation. 

The  parties  eventually  settled  the  case,  and  the  defendant  agreed  to  pay 
compensation  and  litigation  expenses  in  the  sum  of  RMB 1,025  (approximately 
US$ 125) and to issue a public apology. 

It is  to be noted that there is no procedure under PRC law s i d a r  to discovery in 
common-law jurisdctions. The general rule on presentation of evidence is that the party 
asserting an allegation bears the burden of proof. The plaintiff in a copyright infiingernent 
case needs to collect sufficient evidence for discharging the burden of proof. 

However,  the  Civil Procedure  Law  provides that  if a  party  is  unable  to  obtain 
evidence  due  to  objective reasons  or  if  a  court  considers certain  evidence to be  of 
relevance to a case, the court may itself collect the evidence.39 A court has the right to 
obtain evidence from relevant entities and individuals and such entities and indwiduals 
must  provide  evidence.40  In cases where  evidence cannot be obtained by the parties, 
they may request the court to use its power to collect the necessary evidence. 

A  copyright holder  may  also  request  the  court  to  issue  orders for preservation of 
evidence. Under h c l e  74 of the C i d  Procedure Law, a party may request the court to 

39  The Civil Procedure Law, supra, footnote 36, Article 64 
40  Ibid., Article 65. 

198 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

preserve evidence where such evidence is likely to be destroyed or be Micult to obtain in 
the future. Whde this order is stated to be avadable afier the commencement of proceedmgs, 
in practice local PRC courts in some locahties did issue such orders prior to commencement. 
The 2001 Copynght Law made it clear in Article 50 that in the circumstances where 
evidence may be lost or &fficult to obtain, copyright or neighboring right owners may 
apply to the court for an order for preservation of evidence prior to commencing suit. 

11.  BROWSING 

Browsing refers to  viewing material on the  Internet.  Reproduction  of materials 
browsed occurs because of a process called  “caching”, which is  a  common technical 
feature of modern Internet browsers.41 Caching wdl be dxussed in the next Section of 
this article. The CNNIC’S July 2001 survey shows that 73.9 percent of Netizenr in the 
PRC are occasional or fiequent  Net browsers, and that  42.9 percent  of the  Netizens’ 
primary purpose for getting on the Net is to obtain information.42 

There are currently no specific laws and regulations, or litigations, on the issue of 
browsing, although it is expected that the PRC legislature, regulators and courts are not 
going to legislate or rule against browsing, at least in the near future. 

111.  CACHING 

Caching is  the process used  by  Internet browsers of temporarily storing browsed 
material in the random access memory  (RAM) of the browser’s computer and on that 
computer’s hard  drive.43 When a user  browses the Net, he  or she sends requests for 
information to a Web server. The Web server sends the requested document back to the 
indwidual. In normal situations the server does not have the information requested so 
it wdl make the same request to the appropriate server or host of the requested site. If a 
particular site proves to be popular, the first server d make a cache copy of it so that 
in the future it does not have to acquire the data fiom the second server. Caching saves 
the capacity of the network and enables more simultaneous transactions.44 

Caching is  done by the browser program independently of the user.  The lifespan 
of a cache fde in RAM or on the hard drive is contingent on the behaviour of the user. 
As new sites are browsed by the user, the space (the size ofwhich is allocated by the user) 
in the cache wdl be erased and re-written, over and over. The user  can manually clear 
both the hard dnve and RAM caches. In the case of materials cached in RAM, as RAM

only operates while the computer is on, the materials are erased when the computer is 
turned 0% in the case of materials cached in the hard dnve, the materials are not erased 
when the computer is turned OK Whereas the user can manipulate the materials cached 
in a hard drive, it is not possible  to access materials cached in FUM other than through 
the instantaneous use of the particular program on the computer. The user can avoid the 
file cached in the hard drive being deleted and written  over in the process of future 
caching by saving the particular file to another part of the hard drive.45 

There are currently no specific laws and regulations, or litigations, on the issue  of 
cachmg in the PRC. There have  been arguments raised against prohibiting cachmg, the 
strongest argument being that a licence to cache materials on the Net is implied due to the 
nature and the distributive essence of the Intemet.46 The concept of implied licence does 
not exist in the h c ’ s  copyright protection regime and may not be an adequate defence 
against  a  claim  of  copyright infiingement through  caching.  Other  arguments  against 
prohibiting cachmg relate to its crucial role for the efficient operation of the Intemet.47 
The fair-deahng concept in other fields may also be of analogous value. Under Article 22 
of the 2001 Copyright Law, the use of a previously published work, where such use is for 
the purpose of individual study, research or enjoyment, is considered & dealing. Under 
Article 21 of the Regulations for the Protection of Computer Software,48 the mahng of 
a back-up copy by a legitimate sofhare holder is also considered fair dealing. The concept 
of fair dealing may be extended to include caching. Also, due to the techcal nature of 
cachng-including 
it being a common technical feature of modern Internet browsers, the 
user  not being the agent that makes the cache copy, and the transient nature of cached 
is  expected that  the PRC legislature, regulators and  courts are not  going to 
copies-it 
legislate or rule against caching, particularly caching in RAM, at least not in the near future. 
To note is that the question of the legal status of temporary copies was extensively 

debated without agreement at the 1996 WIPO Diplomatic Conference. 

IV.  HYPERLINK 

The term “hyperlink” is defined as a link fiom one part of a page on the Internet 
to  another page,  either  on the same site or a  distant site. For example, a  restaurant’s 
home page may have a hyperlink to its menu. A retailer of laptops might have a link to 
the  site of the laptops’ manufacturers. A  hyperlink is  a way to  connect two  Internet 
resources via a simple word or phrase on whch a user can click to start the connection. 
A  user  can  access  a Website and exercise the option  to hyperlink to another, related 
Website by clichng on that option.49

The  hyperlinks discussed  here  are  those  linking  one  Website  to  another.  The 

Website address of the linked site is &splayed when the site is linked. 

A.  COURT CASES 

The PRC courts have  acknowledged hyperlinks as an important function of the 
Internet and have been prepared to find that hyperlinks are not copyright infringement. 
However, after being notified that the Website being hyperlinked engages in copyright 
infringement, the hyperlink should be closed down. 

1.  Liu v. Sohu Aitexin Info-Tech (Beijind  Co., Ltd.50 

In 1995, Lijiang Publishing House published the Chnese translation of El Ingenioso 
Hidalgo Don Quijote D e  La Manchu (1995 edition) translated by the plaintiff Liu Jingsheng. 
Three  Websites,  t(http://www.cj888.comn, ((http://www.chenqingmyrice.corn)) and 
(<http://www.yifan.net)), displayed  the  translation.  The  defendant  did  not  post  the 
translation onto  its Website  ((http://sohu.com),, another well-known  Website  in  the 
PRC, but the defendant’s Website is hyperlinked to the three Websites. 

The  plaintiff  commenced  litigation  against 

the  defendant  for  copyright 
inhngement  at  the  Beijing  Municipal  No.  2  Intermediate  People’s  Court  on 
24 October 2000, asking the Court to issue an injunction, and order the defendant to 
issue a public apology and pay compensation in the sum of- 
100,000 (US$ 12,195). 
The defendant, on 30 November 2000, agreed to take down the hyperlinks with 

the three Websites. 

An excerpt from the Court’s decision is as follows: 
“Hyperlinking is an important function of the Internet.  Hyperlinking allows the sharing of 
information on the Net. When a visitor is  hyperlinked to  another site, the screen of the 
visitor’s terminal displays the address of the other site. 
The defendant merely provided search functions to its visitors. The information f?om  the 
linked site is not stored in the server of the defendant, but in the  computer of the visitor. 
The  defendant  &d  not  reproduce  or  disseminate  the  work  on  the  Net.  The  content 
provider or disseminator [i.e. the three Websites] should bear the primary responsibility in 
such  cases  and  the  service  provider  [i.e.  the  defendant]  should  generally  not  bear 
responsibility for compensation in such cases. It is  unrealistic to require the defendant to 
conduct due diligence of the contents linked.

201 

However, after a service provider finds out the infringement, it should adopt measures to 
prevent further infringement. The defendant, which was able to technically take down the 
hyperlink, did not promptly do so and is liable thereby.” 
The Court, on 19 December 2000, issued a decision based on Article 106(2) of the 
General Principles of the Civil Law of the People’s Republic of China51 (Civil Law) and 
Article 45(8) of the  1990 Copyright Law  (set out above in Section I.A).  Article 106(2) 
states simply that  citizens and juristic persons who  through their own fault injure the 
property of the State or a collective or the property or person of another person, shall 
be  civilly  liable.  The  Court  ordered  the  defendant  to  issue  an  apology  and  pay 
compensation in the sum of RMB 3,000 (approximately US$ 366). 

2.  Ye  Yanbing v. Sohu Aitexin Info-Tech (Beijing) Co., Ltd.52 

Duolaimi  Investment  Consulting  (Shanghai)  Co.,  Ltd.  posted  the  plaintiff 
Ye  Yanbing’s  book  entitled  Feelings  on  the  Road  onto  its  Website  without  the 
authorization of the plaintiff. Visitors to the defendant’s Website were able to access the 
plaintiffs book through the hyperlink between the defendant’s Website and the Website 
of Duolaimi  Investment  Consulting  (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.  The  plaintiff notified  the 
defendant  of the inhngement and subsequently commenced litigation at the Beijing 
Municipal No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court. 

On the issue of hyperlinking, the Court was of the opinion that this did not result 
in the reproduction  of the information from the linked site in the defendant’s server, 
although there was temporary reproduction at the visitor’s terminal. The Court rejected 
the  claim  of the  plaintiff that  the  defendant  should  be jointly  liable with  Duolaimi 
Investment Consulting (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. which posted the work on the Internet.

licence to the electronic publishing  rights  to  the author’s  various novels for six years. 
The author, on 6 February 2000, issued a document confirming the above copyright 
licence and that the author did not license the rights to any third party. 

Beijing  Jinri  Shidian  Cultural  Affairs  Development  Center  (Jinri)  posted  the 
author’s  two works  covered  under  the  author’s  copyright licence  contract with the 
plaintiff onto its Website.  The first defendant and Jinri  entered into a contract which 
d o w e d  the second defendant’s Website,  tchttp://www.tom.com)), to hyperlink  to the 
two works at Jinri’s  Website.  The Website  ((http://www.tom.com),  indicated  on its 
Web  pages  that  the  works  were  provided  by  Jinri’s  Website.  When  a  visitor  to 
((http://www.tom.corn)) is  linked  to Jinri’s Website,  the linked Web pages  show the 
uniform resource locator (URL, i.e. the Website address) ofJinri’s  Web pages. 

The  plaintiff  discovered  the  linking in June  2000  and  commenced  action  for 
copynght infringement at  the Beijing Municipal No. 2 Intermediate People’s  Court, 
asking the Court to issue an injunction, order the defendants to issue a public apology 
and award  compensation in the sum of 
42,620  (approximately US$ 5,198) plus 
litigation expenses. 

The plaintiff did  not  notify  the  defendants  of its  objection  to the links  prior  to 
commencing litigation.  The second defendant closed  down the hyperlink with Jinri’s 
Website following the commencement of the litigation. 

The Court issued a decision on 27 April 2001. The following is an excerpt fiom 

the Court’s decision: 

“Hyperlinking is a function for providing convenience to visitors for obtaining information 
on  the  Net  and  has  been  used  extensively  by  Internet  operators.  From  a  technical 
perspective, the function of hyperlinking resides in leading the visitor’s search engme to visit 
the linked Website. 
The linked content is not reproduced by the linking Website. The entity putting up the link 
is not the one engaging in the dissemination. The linked Website is the one. The action of 
the entity putting up the link is closer to one assisting in the dissemination. 
Considering the wide variety and large volume of contents being disseminated on the Net 
and the extensive mutual linking between Websites, it will no doubt burden Internet service 
providers with too much responsibility if they are obliged to filter the contents to be linked 
prior to allowing linking. At the same time, because links increase the number of times a 
Website is visited, which in turn is closely related to the economic benefit of the Website, 
it is important for the protection oflegal rights and interests and for regulating dissemination 
on  the  Net  to  require  Internet service  providers  to  pay  reasonable  attention and  bear 
reasonable business risks in this regard. 
Although the current law did not specifically stipulate with respect to linking in the Net 
environment, in accordance with the spirit of the El9901 Copyright Law, and balancing the 
rights and obligations of copyright holders and network service providers (excepting for the 
cases where network service providers clearly knew that the linked contents were infringing 
but  still facilitated  dissemination  through linking, or  after  obtaining warnings  from the 

PRC NETWORK  COPYRIGHT RULES 

203 

copyright holders, still refused to diligently take rectification measures), it is not suitable to 
require network service providers who put up the links to bear liability. 
The evidence in this case did not show that the defendants when putting up the link clearly 
knew that  the linked works were flawed. The link was promptly taken down afier notice 
of the commencement of the suit was given [which coincided with the time when notice 
of intkingement was given to the defendants].” 
The  Court  therefore  rejected  the  claims  by  the  plainti&  The  plaintiff  was 

responsible for the case acceptance fee. 

The following are cases involving deep linking (to be mscussed below), but they 
involved similar issues as the above hyperlink cases. They are, therefore, looked at here:

The defendant’s Website, cthttp://www.mywebinc.com>, made known that it had 
collected about 20,000 MP3 music files and encouraged visitors to access such files. The 
defendant  did  not  upload such MP3  files  onto  its Website. The defendant  collected 
information on third-party Websites where various unauthorized MP3 music files could 
be  downloaded. The information, includmg the names of the songs and singers, was 
then  organized and posted  on the  defendant’s Website. The defendant’s Website also 
provided  deep links to  such  MP3  music  files  on the  third-parties’ Websites  so  that 
visitors could,  through  the  deep links, access  and  download such fdes.  The plaintiff 
music producers, members of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, 
were the neighboring right holders with respect to about 12,000 songs, the subject of 
such MP3 music files. Visitors did access or download such MP3 music files, using the 
deep links put up by the defendant.

THE JOURNAL OF W O U D  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY 

In November 1999, the plaintiffs commenced legal actions at the Beijing Municipal 
No.  2  Intermedate  People’s  Court.  The  lawsuits  were  part  of  the  International 
Federation of Phonographic  Industries’ global  anti-piracy  strategy  “Action for  Legal 
Music on the Internet”. The plaintiffs asked for R M B  10,000 (approximately US$1,220) 
compensation with respect to each song used by the defendant without authorization. 
The Court held a consolidated hearing of all four cases for the determination of the 
facts on 21 February 2000. The parties subsequently settled under the auspices  of the 
Court in March 2000. The defendant agreed to take down the deep links, apologme to 
the  plaintiffs,  and  pay  compensation  in  the  sum  of  RMB 87,500  (approximately 
US$  10,671) to each plaintiff. The defendant also agreed to refrain from repeating the 
infiingement, otherwise it  would  pay  RMB 100,000 (approximately US$  12,195) as 
liquidated damages for infringement with respect to each song of the plaintiffs. 

Following the settlement, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries 
and the defendant joined hands to launch a campaign against  Internet music piracy in 
the PRC through the promotion  of awareness of the illegality of such piracy, especially 
the unauthorized distribution of MP3 files. 

The International Federation of Phonographic Industries estimated that there were 
up to two hundred active inhnging Websites in the PRC.55 The Ministry ofCulture Notice 
Regarding Issues Relevant  to Online Business Activities Involving Audio Visual Products56 was 
issued by the Ministry of Culture on 17 March 2000. The Notice specifically prohibits 
the dealing in MP3 music files downloaded from the Net.57 

B.  AGREED STATEMENTS CONCERNING  THE WCT 

The Agreed Statements concerning Article 8 of the WCT stipulate that the mere 
provision of physical facilities for enabling or malung a communication does not in itself 
amount  to  communication.  The PRC Court’s position in  the  above hyperlink  cases 
seems consistent with the position in the Agreed Statements. 

c.  THE NETWORK  COPYRIGHT INTERPRETATION 

The Network Copyright Interpretation also sets out rules for regulating the actions 

of Internet service providers. 

Article 4 of the Interpretation stipulates that if a computer network service provider 
participates,  through  the  Net,  in  another  person’s  act  of  copyright  infringement  or, 

55  The Intcmational Federation of Phonographic Industries,  15 December 1999, id. 
56  The Ministry  .f Culture  Notice  Regarding  Issues  Relevant  to  Online  Business Activitier  Involving Audio  Visual 

Products, Document Wenshifa (2000) No. 12, issued by the Ministry of Culture of the PRC on 17 March 2000. 

5’  Ibid., Article 4. 

PRC NETWORK COPYRIGHT RULES 

205 

through  the  Net,  aids  and  abets another person’s  act  of  copyright infiingement, the 
service provider is to be jointly liable with that other person for copyright infUngement.58 
This stipulation, arguably, may be applicable in cases similar to the four cases against 
the Manweibao Network System (Beijing) Co., Ltd. discussed above. It may be argued 
that the defendant aided and abetted third-party Websites providing unauthorized MP3 
files which inhnged the plaintiffs’ rights through the provision of information on the 
unauthorized MP3 files and the provision of deep links to such files. 

In the Torn.com case, discussed above, the Court was of the opinion that the action of 
the entity putting up the link is closer to one assisting in the dissemination. Article 4 of the 
Network Copyright Interpretation may be relevant, although the facts of the case indicate 
that the defendants did not have knowledge that the contents linked were &ging. 

Similarly, Article 4 might, arguably, be relevant to the other hyperlink cases if the 

entities putting up the links had knowledge that the linked contents were infhnging. 

V. 

INLINING 

Inlining is the process of &splaying in one Website a graphic file which orignates fiom 
another Website. For example, dining occurs if a user at site A can, without leaving site A, 
view a “cartoon of the day” featured on site B.59  The user wdl be unaware of the source 
of the graphic file, i.e. the “cartoon of the day”, unless he or she deconstructs the html of 
the inlined Web page or the inlining page’s creator chooses to inform the user, neither of 
which typically occurs.@ There is, therefore, the possibility of confusion with respect to the 
source of the graphic file, and the creation of &c 
jams to the inlined Website. Copyright 
infiingement and u&r  competition arguments may be advanced awnst inlining. 

There  were  allegations in  the  Torn.com  case  that  the  link  between  the  second 
defendant’s Website and Jinri’s Website was inlining rather than hyperlink. The Court 
decided  that  the  evidence  did  not  substantiate  the  allegation  and  accepted  the 
defendants’ evidence that the link was hyperlinking.61 

VI.  DEEP LINKING 

A deep link is  a hyperlink that bypasses a Website’s home page  and takes  the user 
du-ectly to  an internal page.  For  example, instead  of linking  to  the  home  page  of  a 
newspaper, a deep link might take the user directly to a newspaper article within the site. 
Deep linlung therefore allows visitors to bypass information and advertisements at the home

page  and go directly to an internal page.  The linked sites can lose income because their 
revenues are ofkn tied to the number ofviewers who pass through their home page. Some 
sites also d i a e  deep li&ng  because bypassing the home page may mistakenly create the 
impression in a user’s mind that the two linked sites are associated or endorse each other.62 
In the following case, the Court was prepared to find deep l i h g  unfair competition. 

Beqing  Finance City Net Co., Ltd. v. Chendu Caizhi Software  C o . ,  Ltd.‘j3 

The  plaintiff collected information on  the  foreign exchange transactions of the 
Beijing  Branch  of  the  China  Construction  Bank  and  organized  it  into  a  diagram 
showing the trends of foreign exchange transactions. The plaintiff posted the diagram 
onto  a  sub-page  in  its  Website  c(http://www.295.net.cn~. The  defendant  had  the 
Website cchttp://www.imoney.com.cnu. Both Websites provided financial information, 
including foreign exchange information, to visitors. In  the middle  of June  2000, the 
defendant linked its Website to the sub-page of the plaintiffs Website where the diagram 
was posted, bypassing the home page of the plaintiff. The defendant took down the deep 
link after being notified of the plaintiffs objection in the middle of August 2000. 

The plaintiff commenced action on 8 October 2000 at the Beijing Municipal No. 2 

Intermediate People’s Court for copyright infringement and unfair competition. 

The Court issued a decision on 13 December 2000. An excerpt from the Court’s 

decision states as follows: 

“As the diagram was prepared by using foreign exchange quotations supplied by the bank, it 
did not constitute a work protected by the Copyright Law. 
There  is  no  specific  law  governing the  issue  of  deep  linking, but  deep  linking without 
authorization  is  generally  objectionable  in  the  information  technology  industry.  The 
economic benefits of Websites  are  related to  the  frequency with  which  the  Websites are 
visited. Websites expend efforts to attract visitors. Deep linking would cause visitors to confuse 
the identity of the developer of the content seen in the linked Website and would cause more 
visitors to visit the Website and less visitors to visit the linked Website, thereby harming the 
interests of the linked Website. If such activities  are not regulated, the development of the 
Internet industry will be harmed. Internet Website operators must operate in accordance with 
the principle of honesty and trustworthiness, and must compete fairly. 
Visitors assessing the plaintiffs diagram through deep linking &om the defendant’s Website 
would  assume  that  the  diagram was  disseminated by  the  defendant  or  at  least  that  the 
defendant’s Website had  some co-operative  relationship with  the  Beijing Branch  of the 
China Construction Bank, causing confusion for the visitors.”

The Court found that the defendant had engaged in unfair competition, issued an 
injunction,  ordered  the  defendant  to  issue  an  apology  and  awarded  RMB 5,000 
(approximately USfb610) compensation plus a certain portion of the case acceptance fee. 

VII. FRAMING 

Framing is the process of allowing a user to view the contents of one Website while 
they are fi-amed by information from another site. For example, a user of a search engine 
may view the contents of an online store that are framed by the search engine's text and 
l0g0s.64 The link does not transfer the user to the linked page but rather brings a part of 
a page, image or text to the user fiom another page. For example, a picture from another 
page is incorporated as a part of the local screen. The local screen stays connected all the 
time, and the URL of the local site is displayed when the framed contents fiom the other 
Website are viewed.65 There is, therefore, confusion for the visitor to the framing site 
with  respect to the source of the framed page. A fiamed site, arguably, also alters the 
appearance of the fiamed content and creates the impression that its owner endorses or 
voluntarily chooses to associate with the fi-aming site.66 

Under PRC law, copyright infringement and unfair competition arguments may be 

advanced in fiaming cases. The following case relates to deep linlung and fiaming. 

Beijing  Baiwang Infomation Co., Ltd. v. Beijing  Sitongl$ang  Information Technology Co., 
Ltd. and  Beijing Xinlang Internet  Information Service  Co., Ltd. (Yiwangdakang  Information

Municipality  and  posted  it  onto  its  Website,  ((http://tonight.corn.cn)). The  first

67  The concept of a third party in litigation in the PRC has some resemblance to that of amicus curiae. Under 
Article 56 of the Civil Procedure  Law, supra, footnote 36, if a third party has no independent  right of claim with 
respect to the subject-matter  of an action between two parties, but the outcome of the case will afFect its legal 
interests, it may apply to participate in the proceedings or the court may not*

issue a decision binding on the third party. In such a case, the third party has the rights and obligations of litigants. 
In this case, the third party joined in the action upon the request of the defendant.

defendant was  the  owner and the second defendant was  the operator of the Website 
((http://sina.com.cm). The third party was responsible for the operation of a section on 
((http://sina.com.cm), under a contract with the second defendant. The third party set 
up a deep link from that section to a sub-page  of the plaintiffs Website, bypassing its 
home page. The linked sub-page  was  also framed by the third party. The section on 
((http://sina.com.cn),,  although  not  very  prominently,  indicated  that  the  linked 
contents  were  re-transmitted  and  that  ((http://tonight.corn.cn)) was  the  copyright 
owner. 

The plaintiff commenced litigation at the Beijing Municipal No. 2 People’s Court 
on 29 April 2000, asking the Court to issue an injunction, order the defendant to issue 
a  public apology and pay  compensation in  the  sum of RMI3  250,000  (approximately 
US$ 30,488) plus legal fees. 

The Court issued  a decision on 27 April 2001. The following is an excerpt &om 

the Court’s decision on the issue of deep linking: 

“Although cthttp://sina.com.cn>) indicated that the copyright of the linked contents belonged 
to ((http://tonight.corn.cn)), in the current Internet’s ‘attention economy’, the deep linking, 
which resulted in bypassing the advertisements and promotions displayed on the plaintiffs 
home page, directly caused harm to the plaintiffs Website, affected the number of visits to 
the plaintiffs Website, and lowered its market value, and caused a corresponding increase 
in the number of visits to the linking site. The deep linking constitutes unfair competition. 
The defendants should be correspondingly liable with the third party. The third party, being 
the infkinging section’s operator and the one putting up the link, should take down the link 
forthwith.” 
The decision unfortunately did not separately address the issue of framing. 
The Court, in accordance with Article 2 of the Unfair Competition Law,69 ordered 
the defendants to issue an apology to the plaintiff and pay compensation in the sum of 
RMI3 6,000 (approximately US$ 732) and part of the case acceptance fees. 

VIII.  HOSTING 

According to CNNIC’S July 2001 Survey results, 24.4 percent of Netizens in the PRC 
had their own personal home pages.70 Many of these home pages are hosted by Internet 
content  or  service providers  for  ftee.  The  case  below  looks  at  the  liabdity  of  the 
providers in cases where  the personal home page hosted by  the providers engages in 
infiingement activities. 

69 Article  2  of  the  Unfair  Competition  Law,  supra,  footnote  19, stipulates  that  business  operatoa should 
observe the principles of voluntariness, equality, equitability, honesty and trustworthiness, and abide by generally 
accepted business ethics in business transactions.

A.  CASE: University Studentjournal  Publishing  House v. Beijingjingxun  Public 

Information  Technology  Co., Ltd. and Li71 

The plaintiff published a special edition called Biblefor Graduate Entrance Exums in 
September 1998. In August 1999, the second defendant, Li Xiang, posted articles &om 
the publication onto his home page c(kaoyan.topcool.net)) hosted by the first defendant 
at  ((http://www.263.net)>. When  the  plaintiff notified  the  idingement to  the  first 
defendant on 8 December 1999, the first defendant closed the section in the second 
defendant’s Website which disseminated the in6inging contents, informed the plaintiff 
that  it  would  try to  locate the  second defendant, and  did  try  to  locate the  second 
defendant. The second defendant subsequently deleted the  infringing contents from 
c(kaoyan.topcool.net)). 

The plaintiff commenced action against the first defendant at Beijing Municipal 
Haidan  District  People’s  Court.  Due  to  jurisdictional  challenges,  the  case  was 
transferred to the Beijing No. 2 Intermedate People’s Court. The second defendant was 
joined as a defendant. The plaintiff asked the Court to issue an injunction against the 
defendants, and order the defendants to issue a public apology and pay compensation in 
the sum of RMEI 100,000 (approximately US$ 12,195) plus notarization and litigation 
expenses. 

The Court issued a decision on 28 November 2000. An excerpt &om the Court’s 
decision with respect to the copyright infringement claim against the second defendant 
states: 

“The posting of a work  onto the Net constitutes reproduction of the work and such a use 
still falls within  the  regulatory regime for  copyright protection. The  second defendant’s 
posting of a substantial portion of the plaintiffs publication onto the c(kaoyan.topcool.net)) 
home page without the authorization of the plaintiff constitutes copyright infringement.” 
The Court, basing its decision on Articles 14(1) and 45(5) of the 1990 Copyright 
Law,  issued  an  injunction  against  the  second  defendant  and  ordered  the  second 
defendant to pay RMEI 5,000 (approximately US$610) to the plaintiff and issue a public 
apology. Article  45(5)  is  set  out  above  in  Section  LA.  Article  14(1) stipulates that 
copyright in a work of compilation shall vest in the editor, provided that the editor’s 
exercise of such right shall not prejudce copyright in the pre-existing works. 

The Court found that the evidence did not support the plaintiffs claim for RMEI 
100,000  (approximately US$  12,195) compensation.  The  plaintiff  and  the  second 
defendant shared in the payment of the case acceptance fee.

THE JOURNAL O F  WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

The Court found the first defendant not liable to the plaintiff. An excerpt &om the 

Court’s decision on the issue of hosting states: 

“An  Internet  service  provider  which  merely  provides  physical  facilities for  enabling  a 
communication is not liable for the content of the Website hosted by it unless the content 
is  specijically prohibited  by  laws  or  regulations.  The provider  has  no other legal  obligation to 
filter, select and control the content. In view of the large volume and the great variety of 
information and the complicated sources of rights to the information  existing and being 
disseminated on the Net, it is difficult and unrealistic to require a network service provider, 
which  merely  provides  physical  facilities for  enabling  a  communication,  to  promptly 
conduct  due diligence of the  rights to  all of the  contents being  disseminated. However, 
when the right holder notifies the provider of infringement, it is unfair to the right holder 
if the provider does not take technical measures to stop the dissemination and delete the 
content  since  the  provider  has  the  most  control  with  respect  to  the  dissemination  of 
information on the Net. Therefore, when a right holder has made a reasonable request, the 
provider has an obligation to take technical measures against the infringing content in order 
to prevent further infringement. 
In this case, the first defendant took technical measures to close the section displaying the 
infringing contents and tried to locate the second defendant after having received notice 
from the plaintiff of the infiingement and confirmed the facts of infringement. It was the 
actions of the first defendant that pressured the second defendant into deleting the infringing 
contents. The first defendant fulfiied its obligation and should not be liable with the second 
defendant.” (emphasis added). 

The plaintiffs claim against the first defendant was therefore rejected by the Court. 

It seems that on the issue of liability for an Internet service provider which merely 
hosted an infringing site, the Court was of the opinion that the provider was not liable 
for the infringing content unless the  content was  “specifically prohibited by  laws  or 
regulations”.  PRC  regulations  specifically  prohibit  the  dissemination  o n h e   of 
information which 

-  instigates resistance to or sabotage of the enforcement of the Constitution or 

of laws and admmistrative regulations of the PRC; 

- 

- 
- 

- 

- 

instigates the  subversion of PRC State power  or the  overthrow of the PRC 
socialist system; 

instigates separatism or sabotages the unity of the PRC State; 

instigates ethnic hatred or discrimination between ethnic groups or sabotages 
ethnic unity in the PRC; 

fabricates stories, distorts facts, spreads rumors or disturbs public order; 

propagates feudal superstition, obscenity, pornography, gambling, violence, 
murder, terrorism or the instigation of crimes; 

- 

publicly humiliates others or fabricates stories to slander others; 

PRC NETWORK COPYRIGHT RULES 

21 1 

-  damages the reputation of the PRC State institutions; 
-  otherwise violates the Constitution, laws or adrmnistrative regulations of the 

PRC.72 

B.  THE NETWORK COPYRIGHT INTERPRETATION 

The provisions of the Network Copyright Interpretation regulating the actions of 

Internet content and service providers are relevant in hosting cases. 

Under Article 5 of the  Interpretation, where an Internet service provider which 
provides content  has  knowledge that  a  Net  user  infringes copyright on the  Net,  or 
where it has been notified of the infringement but stdl fails to take action with respect 
to the inhngement, it is to be jointly liable with the user.73 

There is liabihty for the provider under Article 5 only if the content provider has 
knowledge of the inhngement.  Ths is  reminiscent of the liability for publishers with 
respect to inhnging works published by them. Under the Reply Regarding the Liability of 
Publishers which Published Infringing  Works,74 a publisher is jointly liable with the infi-inger 
only if the publisher is negligent or at fault, or if the publisher continues to publish and 
distribute the infringing publication after obtaining notice of the infringement. 

An  Internet  service  provider  which  provides  content  is  to  be  held  liable  for 
infringement where a copyright holder requests the provider to furnish information on 
the  infi-inger’s regstration  with  the  provider  for  investigating the  infringer  but  the 
provider refuses without reasonable grounds.75 

The provider does not have the obligation to entertain the request of a copyright 
holder if he or she is unable to produce adequate proof of his or her identity, his or her 
copyright ownership and the infiingement.76 If the copyright holder produces the above

proof  but  the  provider  still  fails  to  take  action,  the  copyright  holder  may  seek  a 
preliminary  injunction  against  the  provider  at  the  time  of  commencement of  the 
litigation with respect to the inhngement.77 

If a provider adopts measures such as removing allegedly inhngmg contents after 
the copyright holder has made such a request (duly supported by evidence), the court is 
not to  allow an  action by  the alleged.infiinger  against the  provider for adopting the 
measures.78 

If  a  copyright  holder’s in6ingement  claim  fails,  the  copyright  holder  is  to  be 
responsible for compensating the loss suffered by the alleged inhnger as a result of the 
measures taken by the provider.79 

It  appears  that  the  above  provisions  are  not  applicable to  an  Internet  service 
provider  which  merely  provides  physical  facilities  for  enabling  or  making  a 
communication. 

C.  THE REGULATIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTERNET ELECTRONIC 

MESSAGING SERVICES 

The Regulations for the Administration of Internet Electronic Messaging Services 
(EMS Regulations)80 govern the provision of electronic messaging services and the use 
of  electronic  messaging  to  publish  information.  Electronic  messaging  services  are 
defined  in  the  EMS Regulations  as  acts  enabling  online  subscribers  to  publish 
information on the Internet in an interactive form, such as bulletin boards, whiteboards, 
discussion forums, chat rooms, message boards, etc.81 Article 13 ofthe Regulations states 
that if an EMS provider discovers any of the nine types of information (set out in Section 
A above) in its EMS system, it should immediately obliterate the information, maintain 
the relevant record and report to the State. 

IX.  METATAGS 

Meta tags  are keywords embedded into the html of a Web page and are read by 
search engines in order to  identify for searchers those pages  on the  Internet that are 
relevant to  their search. Upon  the  request by  a searcher for a  specific keyword, the 
search engine will spew out a list of sites prioritized by, among other things, whether or 
not the keyword typed by the searcher appears in a site’s meta tags.82

PRC NETWORK  COPYRIGHT RULES 

213 

Typically, a Website designer will use meta tags that describe and market their site 
to potential consumers. There are meta tags other than those devoted to keywords, and 
not every page has meta tags for keywords.83 

When one of the keywords in a site’s meta tags is a trademark or trade name owned 
by  a  third  party,  trademark  or  trade-name  infringement  and  unfair  competition 
arguments are relevant. 

In the Beijing Chuanglian case (discussed above in Section I.D.3), the Court found 
that the plaintiffs e-mail address <csales@hichina.com,) was embedded in the html of 
the  defendant’s Web  page  which  copied  the  design  and  content  of the  plaintiffs 
domain-name  online registration feedback form displayed on the plaintiffs Website. 
The Court took the e-mail  address as a piece of evidence supporting the claim that 
the defendant copied the design of the feedback form from the plaintiffs Website. 

The e-mad  address appeared to be  a  meta tag on the plaintiffs Web  page.  The 
Court in this case did not go into the issues of trademark infiingement and passing off 
of trademark under Article 5(1) of the Unfair Competition Law, although such issues 
may be relevant-for 

instance if “hichina” is a PRc-registered trademark. 

In the usual meta tag case, depending on the situation, the inhnged party may also 
rely on other unfair competition  grounds, such as  under  Article 5(2) and  (3) of the 
Unfair  Competition  Law.  Article  5(2) prohibits the  unauthorized  use  of the  name, 
packaging  or  trade  dress  peculiar  to  well-known  merchandise  or  use  of  a  name, 
packaging or trade dress similar to that of well-known  merchandise, and Article 5(3) 
prohibits the  unauthorized  use  of the  enterprise name or personal name  of another 
party. 

X.  DATABASES 

According  to  the  China  State  Information  Office’s  survey,  there  are  45,598 
databases on the Net in the PRC and approximately 11 percent of the Websites collect 
fees  for  the  use  of  such  online  databases.84  Under  the  1990  Copyright  Law,  a 
compilation was protected by copyright only if the materials compiled were protected 
works  already, or parts  of such protected  works.85  However,  foreign  works that  are 
compilations  of  unprotected  materials but  are  original  in  terms  of  the  selection  or 
arrangement of  the  materials  are  protected  as  compilation works.86  How  the  1990 
Copyright Law was applied may be seen in the following case.

THE JOURNAL OF WOIUD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Beijing Huaxinjie Investment  Consulting  Co., Ltd. v. Machinery  Industrial Information 
Academ y87 

The plaintiff, in September 1998, developed a database of information on projects 
with an investment value of over RMB 10,000,000 (approximately US$  1,219,512) in 
the  PRC. The  database,  which  was  periodically  updated,  was  licensed  out.  The 
defendant obtained a licence to use the database over the Net on 15 March 1999. The 
plaintiff claimed  that  the  defendant  edited the  information in  the  database  and  then 
incorporated the  edited database  into  the  1999 issues  of the  defendant’s publication 
entitled China Project Special Edition. 

~ 

In November  1999, the plaintiff commenced litigation at the Beijing Municipal 
No.  1  Intermediate  People’s  Court  against  the  defendant  for  infnngement  of  its 
copyright  of  the  database,  aslung  the  Court  to  issue  an  injunction  and  order  the 
500,000  (approximately 
defendant  to  pay  compensation  in  the  sum  of 
US$ 60,976), pay  enforcement expenses in  the  sum  of Rhm  23,000  (approximately 
US$  3,000) and  issue  a  public  apology. Included in  the  defendant’s defence was  the 
argument that the plaintiffs database was not protected by copyright. 

The Court issued a decision in December 2000, rejecting the plaintiffs claims. The 
Court was of the opinion that the content of the database was not created by the plaintiff 
and  &d  not  possess  the  originahty  required  for  copyright protection;  therefore, the 
database was not protected by copyright. The Court also found that the actions of the 
defendant  did  not  cause  any  harm  to  the  plaintiff  and  did  not  constitute  unfair 
competition. 

The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Beijing Municipal High People’s Court. 
The Appeal Court issued a decision in 2001 upholding the decision of the Court of First 
Instance. 

The 2001 Copyright Law provides protection to an original compilation even if it 

consists of materials not already protected as works.88 

XI.  FURTHER LEGISLATIVE AND  REGULATORY R E F O R M  

The various network cases, together with the Network Copyright Interpretation, 
the Digital Product Regulation and the 2001 Copyright Law, have provided valuable 
guidelines for the Internet game, and have an important impact for everyone, not just 
for Internet service providers and Internet content providers. The new guidelines are 
probably not  surprising as  they are merely logical extensions of the  rules used  in the 
traditional sphere of the Net environment.

PRC NETWORK COPYRIGHT RULES 

215 

As  PRC court cases do not have precedent value, issues although litigated but not 
addressed in the 2001 Copyright Law, the Digital Product Regulation or the Network 
Copyright Interpretation, should be addressed through legislative or regulatory reform 
or Supreme Court interpretation. Issues which have not even been litigated should be 
similarly addressed. Issues relating to idning and meta tags are issues which require legal 
guidance. 

XII.  COPYRIGHT ENFORCEMENT 

The impact of the  new  body  of network  rules  is  still to be  seen. The PRC has 

stepped up protection against copyright infringement with the 2001 Copyright Law. 

Articles  49  and  50  of  the  current  Law  have  introduced  pre-suit  provisional 
measures.  As  mentioned  above,  Article  49  states  that  in  the  circumstances where 
evidence may be lost or difficult to obtain, copyright or neighbouring right owners may 
apply to the court for an order for preservation of evidence prior to commencing suit. 
Article 50 provides that  if  the  copyright owner  or the  neighboring right  owner  has 
evidence showing that  someone is  or will  infringe its rights, and if it  is  not  stopped 
promptly  irreparable harm will be  caused  to  legal rights and  interest, the  copyright 
owner or the neighboring right owner may apply to the court for an injunction and an 
order  for  the  preservation  of  property  prior  to  commencing  suit.  Article  50  is 
introduced also for TRIPS compliance purposes. 

The 2001 Law has also introduced legal remedies against the removal or alteration 
of electronic rights management information applied for the protection of works.89 The 
Network Copyright Interpretation has also made similar stipulation in Article 9(4). 

As  it is often dfficult to assess damages in copyright infnngement  cases, statutory 
damages have also been introduced in the 2001 Copyright Law; its Article 48 states that 
infiingers are to compensate the actual loss suffered by a right holder. In cases where the 
actual loss is dfficult to assess, the compensation may be calculated in accordance with 
the illegal income of the inhngers.90 Enforcement expenses of the right holders should 
also be compensated.91 In cases where the right holder’s actual loss or the illegal income 
of the inhngers may not be confirmed, the court may, depending on the circumstances, 
500,000 (approximately US$ 60,976).92 Similar 
award compensation of less than 
rules  for  the  calculation of compensation are  set out in  Article  10 of the  Network 
Copyright Interpretation, although the Interpretation further specifies that the plaintiff 
has the right to choose whether to use its loss or the inhnger’s gain as the basis for the 
calculation of compensation.

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Article 51 of the 2001 Copyright Law further states that the court may make forfeit 
the  illegal  income  and  infiinging goods  and  materials which  have been  used  in  the 
committing of the offence. Its Article 52 provides that there is legal liability with respect 
to the publishing of reproductions of works or the reproduction of works which cannot 
be  proved  to  have  been  legally authorized,  and  with  respect  to  the  dm-ibution  of 
reproductions of works and the rental of cinematographic works, computer software or 
audio visual products where the sources of such items for distribution or rent cannot be 
proved to be legitimate. 

Serious  copyright  inhngement  is  punishable  under  the  Criminal  Law  of  the 
People’s Republic of China.93 Articles 217 and 218 of the  Criminal Law  stipulate as 
follows: 

2. 

3. 

“Article 21 7: Whoever, for the purpose of making profits, commits any of the following acts 
of copyright infringement shall, if the amount of illegal gains is relatively large, or if there 
are other serious circumstances, be  fined with or without  being sentenced to fured-tern 
imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention; if the amount of illegal 
gains is large or if there are other especially serious circumstances, he or shall be sentenced 
to fmed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years and 
shall also be fined: 
1. 

reproducing and distributing a written work, musical work, motion picture, television 
programme  or  other  visual  works,  computer  software  or  other  works,  without 
authorization &om the copyright owner; 
publishing a book of which the exclusive right of publication is  enjoyed by  another 
person; 
reproducing and distributing an audio or video recording produced by another person 
without authorization fkom the producer; or 
producing or selling a work of fine art with forged signature. 

4. 
Article 218: Whoever, for the purpose of making profits, knowingly sells infiinging works 
as mentioned in Article 217 of this Law shall be fined, with or without being sentenced to 
fmed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention, if the amount 
of illegal gains is large.” 
To  note  is  that  Article  217  is  applicable  only  in  the  case  where  the  infiinger 
infiinged copyright “for the purpose of making profits”. Article 218 is applicable only 
in the case where the i n h g e r  inhnged copyright “for the purpose of making profits” 
and where the infinnger “had knowledge of the infiingement”. 

The 2001  Copyright  Law  has  specifically incorporated  a  reference  to  criminal
