‘It’s the Ad text, stupid’1: cryptic answers won’t
establish legal certainty for online advertisers
Stephan Ott and Maximilian Schubert

The Advocate General opened his opinion with a cita-
tion from the New Testament:
‘Seek, and you shall
ﬁnd.’2 The hopes of advertisers and trade mark owners
for more legal certainty, however, were disappointed,
when the ECJ, on 23 March 2010, following a reference
from the French Cour de Cassation,3 rendered its ﬁrst
decision dealing with keyword advertising.4

Although the ECJ left the interpretation of numer-
ous issues with the national courts, the press largely
agreed that this decision was a victory for Google. It,
however, took only a couple of hours before comment-
ators all over the globe began critically analysing the
decision, speculating on how the national courts might
eventually decide and pointing out a number of
questions.5 Following subsequent debate,6 it is safe to
say that it might be attorneys who are the real winners,
as it is now in their hands to explore the room left for
interpretation by processing new lawsuits before the
national courts.

Cause of action
Google was sued in France on the ground that its
AdWords service allowed customers to book third-
party keywords that lead to the display of an advertise-
ment. Case C-236/08 concerned the well-reputed
French trade marks ‘Louis Vuitton’ and ‘LV’ and the
Community trade mark ‘Vuitton’; Case C-237/08 con-
cerned the French trade marks of Viaticum,
‘Bourse
des Vols’, ‘Bourse des Voyages’, and ‘BDV’; Case C-238/
08 concerned the trade mark ‘Eurochallenges’ of Mr
Thonet. While in Vuitton, the trade mark was actually
contained in the text of the ad, which furthermore led
to websites promoting imitations of Vuitton products,
in the other two cases against competitors of
the
respective trade mark owner, the text of the ad did not
include the trade mark itself.7

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2011, Vol. 6, No. 1

Trade mark infringement by Google
The ECJ found that Google, as the provider of a refer-
encing service, had not
infringed trade mark law.
Although it is clear that AdWords operates ‘in the
course of trade’ when it permits advertisers to book
signs identical with trade marks as keywords, stores
those signs, and displays its clients’ ads in this manner,
it does not follow, however, that the service provider
‘uses’ those signs within the terms of the Trade Mark
Directive. Thus Google may only be held liable, if

-

-

the requirements for a violation of the rights of the
trade mark owner by the advertisers are fulﬁlled;

the national prerequisites for intermediary liability
are met; and

- no liability exemptions apply.

Trade mark infringement by the
advertiser
The Court ﬁrst held that an advertiser booking a trade
mark as a keyword is using that trade mark in the
course of trade (paras 51 and 52). Furthermore, the use
‘is in relation to goods or services’,
irrespective of
whether the sign is also shown in the text of the ad
(para 60 ff).8

The ECJ then proceeded to the core of its decision,
stating that a trade mark owner cannot oppose the use
of a sign identical to the trade mark as a keyword, if
that use is not liable to cause detriment to any of the
trade mark functions (para 76). Such functions are
not only the function of indicating origin, but also
the communication,
investment, or the advertising
functions (para 77). The Court had already established
this in L’Ore´al v Bellure in 2009.9

ment of ‘likelihood of confusion’ for cases of ‘double
identity’ (Article 5(1)(a) TMD),10 similar to that for
Article 5(1)(b) TMD.11 This means a serious alteration
of trade mark law and leads to a restriction of trade
mark owners’ rights. For (a) to be infringed, one of the
functions has to be affected or liable to be affected by
the act of the advertiser. As for (b), the requirements
have not changed. Only the essential trade mark func-
tion (function of origin) is protected (paras 49 and 79).
The ECJ’s ﬁndings in respect to the protection of the
advertising function by means of Article 5(1) TMD
were criticized by commentators,12 while the Court of
Appeal for England and Wales referred to the ECJ’s
concept as ‘conceptually vague and ill-deﬁned’.13

Function of indicating origin
The ECJ decision
The ECJ conﬁrmed its own case law, according to which
it is the essential function of a trade mark to guarantee
to consumers the origin of the goods or services by
enabling them to distinguish the goods or services from
others that have a different origin (para 82). The ques-
tion in this respect is whether that function is adversely
affected through keyword advertising with trade mark-
protected terms. The answer depends, in particular, on
the manner in which the ad is presented. In effect, this
means that it is the text or the content of the ad that
determines whether it infringes (para 83). Other than
the Advocate General in his opinion,14 the ECJ does not
distinguish between the act of booking the keyword (as
a purely internal process) and the display of the ad sub-
sequent to a matching user query (as an external and
publicly visible process). Instead, the ECJ, without expla-
nation, assumes a comprehensive view.

The Court, through the requirement of the effect of
the trade mark functions, introduced a de facto require-

It is thus for the national courts to assess, on a case-
by-case basis, whether the function of indicating origin

circumstances there is no use of the trade mark (MarkenR 2009, 216). See

commercial
trade mark owner (para 89) or

was adversely affected or if any risk of it existed (para
88). According to the ECJ, this conclusion is reached
when:
† the advertiser’s ad actually suggests the existence of a
link between the advertiser and the
† the ad is vague to such an extent that a normally
informed and reasonably attentive internet user is
unable to determine, on the basis of the advertising
link and the commercial message attached thereto,
whether the advertiser is a third party vis-a`-vis the
proprietor of the trade mark or, on the contrary,
is economically linked to the trade mark owner
(para 90).

Criticism and open questions
The ECJ focuses primarily on the text of the ad.15
Unfortunately, for advertisers, the space in such an ad
is strictly limited. AdWords usually consist of
four
lines. The title of the ad must only contain 25 charac-
ters and the two following lines 35 characters each. The
last line contains the Display-URL. Top-Ads, which are
displayed above the (‘organic’) search results, usually
consist of only two lines, while the same character
limitations apply. Further restrictions limit the content
of the ad: eg prices displayed must not be misleading,
additional
information about promotions must be
provided with one to two clicks on the landing site and
the text
should not contain certain call-to-action
phrases, encouraging the user to perform certain tasks,
such as eg to click on to a link.16 The Display-URL
shown at the bottom of the ad also has to fulﬁl certain
criteria. It need not be identical to the Destination-
URL to which the ad is linked, but it has to be a
genuine URL that is part of the advertiser’s site.17 Thus

use
but

For an advertiser, it is crucial to know how to draft
the ad to avoid any likelihood of confusion concerning
the origin of the offered goods or services. This might,
however, be a difﬁcult task, considering that the web-
savvyness of an average search-engine user is sur-
prisingly low. Only one in three users is aware of the
difference between ads and search results on the results
pages; only one in six users states that he or she can
clearly distinguish between them and just one out of 10
is aware that search engines ﬁnance themselves through
advertising.18 While the German Federal Supreme
Court and the Advocate General have liberally assumed
that users will, under no circumstances, establish a link
between the ads and the search term/trade mark
entered, French courts have repeatedly expressed the
opposite opinion. In the absence of studies focusing
explicitly on this issue,19 the ECJ has apparently chosen
the middle path, providing only a vague framework to
assist national courts deciding upon this question;
many issues related to which we still miss empirical
evidence.

Here are some guidelines for advertisers to take into

account when drafting an ad:

1. It is disputed whether users pay attention to the
Display-URL at all.20 An indication that they actually
do is that Google, despite its severe space restrictions
for text ads, continues to display it. This issue,
however, might not be of great signiﬁcance if the
users see that the trade mark they seek is not con-
tained in the Display-URL, they could interpret this
as an indication that the (linked) website is not the
site of the trade mark owner. Since the users will not
be able to tell if the advertiser is commercially con-
nected to the trade mark owner, a likelihood of con-
fusion cannot generally be ruled out.

2. Usually the display of a trade mark in an ad will
increase the danger of a likelihood of confusion. But
if the ad is used for comparative advertising and the
legal requirements
for its permissibility are ful-
ﬁlled,21 there will be infringement of neither unfair

trade mark law. This was

the
competition nor
opinion of the Court in L’Ore´al, where it found that
the use of a competitor’s trade mark in comparative
advertising is permitted by Community law if
it
fulﬁls the (stringent) legal requirements for com-
parative advertising.22

3. One might argue that a trade mark owner who dis-
plays ads on Google may not be protected against
ads by third parties. A user searching for a trade
mark will see the ad of the trade mark owner and
might conclude that all the other ads stem from
unrelated third parties, as it is not very likely that
the trade mark owner would compete with compan-
ies to which he or she is commercially linked for
user attention. Thus if a user can easily recognize the
ad of
this will probably
reduce the risk of confusion concerning the origin of
the other ads. The trade mark owner may, however,
pause or end his ad-campaign at any time, so third
parties cannot rely on this fact.

the trade mark owner,

4. Where multiple ads are shown, a user will assume
that not all of them stem from the trade mark owner
or a commercially linked entity. It will, however, be
unclear to the user which ads are related and which
are not.

5. Another issue that proves that both sides—trade
mark owners and advertisers—might see the ECJ’s
decision as a victory for themselves is that the ads
are clearly labelled and separated from the (organic)
search results.23 It might be argued that the layout is
a strong indication that users will not automatically
establish a connection between the ad and the trade
mark owner, unless there are other indications of a
possible connection, such as the use of the trade
mark in the text of the ad or in the Display-URL.24
The ECJ might, however, not support this argument.
In the second question referred to the ECJ by the
Austrian OGH, the Court was asked whether an
infringement depends upon whether an ad is shown
in a separate section and is labelled as an advertise-
ment.25 The ECJ interpreted this as a question on
whether the trade mark owner should also be pro-

tected if the ad is shown outside the section ‘spon-
sored links’ and thus inside the search results. As
this is generally not the case, the Court refused to
answer the question. The ECJ could have used this
opportunity to explain, in more detail, the connec-
tion between the function of origin and the obli-
gation to separate ads from content.

6. Advertisers must remain cautious. Many users will
not have sufﬁcient knowledge about the economic
connections of the companies in the markets con-
cerned. Competitors of the trade mark owner would
thus be forced to use the already fairly restricted
space of
to provide information clear
enough to avoid users assuming any nonexistent con-
nection. Depending on how user perception of ads is
evaluated (assuming no connection as the basic rule,
or assuming a less savvy user who is not aware of
how search engines work), courts will place more or
less stringent requirements on the advertiser.

their ads

Uncertainity remains
Keyword advertising with a competitor’s trade marks
can adversely affect the trade mark function of indicat-
ing origin. But this is up to the national courts to
decide, on a case-by-case basis and with the general
principles of the ECJ in mind. In consequence, this
might cause further legal uncertainty: some national
courts might not just require advertisers to refrain
from using the trade mark in the text of the ad but
may impose additional burdens.

Advertising function
The ECJ’s decision
The trade mark owner is entitled to object to the use of
his sign if it adversely affects his use of the trade mark
as a factor in sales promotion or as an instrument of
commercial strategy (the advertising function). The
Court found that the use of a mark by a third party in
the course of keyword advertising causes certain disad-
vantages to the trade mark owner, such as the need to
place a higher bid for a click on his ad (Cost-per-Click,

22 ECJ, MR-Int 2008, 24—O2, para 45; ECJ, GRUR Int. 2009, 1010—

L’Ore´al, para 72; ECJ, GRUR Int. 2003, 742—Pippig Augenoptik,
para 39, 49.

23 Differentiation between ads and organic search results may be difﬁcult, as

search engines progressively include various kinds of information (eg
maps or pictures) together with or above their search results. A big
challenge may also lie in mobile devices, as their screen space is severely
limited. The same is also true for augmented reality applications, where
the user is constantly and automatically supplied with information
without being informed where the data displayed stems from. Such
services, which for example ‘enrich’ the interior view of a shopping centre

with restaurant ratings and suggestions, usually do not indicate its origin.

or CPC), to have it displayed more prominently than
the ads of his competitors. This results from the fact
that keywords are ‘sold’ on the basis of a continuous
(sealed second price) auction,26 which means that
prices soar when more advertisers bid, or are allowed
to bid, on the same keyword. As the ranking of the ads
is also inﬂuenced by other factors (eg the surﬁng
behaviour of users, who have already clicked on ads in
the past),27 the highest bid does not assure ranking as
the most prominent ad. These repercussions, however,
do not in themselves constitute an adverse effect on the
advertising function of the trade mark. As a result of
this reasoning of the Court, one might conclude that
the advertising function of a trade mark is never
adversely affected through keyword advertising. The
Court, however, continued, in paragraphs 96 and 97, to
explain this reasoning, which might be of future signiﬁ-
cance:
it said that the visibility of the trade mark
owner’s goods and services to internet users is guaran-
teed, as the home and advertising page of the proprie-
tor of that mark will appear in the list of the ‘organic’
search results, usually even in one of
the highest
positions.

Criticism and unanswered questions
The ECJ’s reasoning assumes that
the trade mark
owner is usually listed prominently in the search
results. When searching for the trade marks mentioned
in the cases against Google.fr in May 2010, the websites
of the trade mark owners were actually displayed as
most prominent entries on the search results pages.
Since the ranking of a web page is effectively based
upon a large number of (undisclosed) factors,28 it
cannot be automatically assumed that the site of the
trade mark owner will always be displayed among the
ﬁrst 10 search results—usually the only ones users
notice.

It is in this respect critical to understand that an
entity that does not allocate resources to search engine
optimization (SEO)29 might easily ﬁnd itself displayed
in less prominent positions inside the search result.
Particularly if an entity is the proprietor of a number
of trade marks that are not reﬂected in the URLs of the
respective websites, a prominent ranking inside the
search results is not guaranteed but may only be
achieved through investment. The reverse conclusion of
this reasoning might be the question of whether a trade
mark owner who does not invest in SEO should be
rewarded by the revival of protection based on the
advertising function of his trade mark, as his website
will be practically absent from the search results.

This idea might even be developed further. What
would happen if the ofﬁcial web-presence of a trade
mark owner cannot be found through search engines at
all? If search engine optimizers are caught by search
engines, using illicit ways of improving their websites
ranking (Cloaking, Doorway Pages etc.)30, the respect-
ive website might be removed from the search engine
index, which means that it will no longer be ﬁndable
through that search engine. Such cases of ‘delisting by
Google’ are rare and sometimes only temporarily, as eg
in the case of the website of the German car-maker
BMW.31

A not overly convincing conclusion would be that
violation of the search engine’s guidelines for search
engine optimization, which effectively means
the
removal from the search engine’s index, might lead to
the grant of additional trade mark protection, since the
trade mark owner is no longer visible inside the web
search results.

That such considerations are not purely speculative
can be demonstrated by the claim later withdrawn32 by
Ascentive against Google in the USA.33 The case
mainly dealt with the booking of a sign identical to
Ascentive’s
trade mark by third parties, but also

28 Search engines assign a so-called ‘rank’ to each website, which indicates

the position on which it will be shown in the list of (‘organic’) search
results. This rank is based on a complicated algorithmic formula, which
evaluates a large number of factors and is subject to steady changes.
So-called ‘On-Page Factors’, such as the use of the keyword in the text or
the title of the website, the domain, or the ﬁle name, play an import role
in addition to the overall popularity of the web presence. The latter is
dependent on how well the site is linked, taking into account the number,
as well as the quality of the links (‘PageRank’ system).

29 Search engine optimization is the process of improving the volume or
quality of trafﬁc to a website from search engines via (‘organic’) search
results. Search engines such as Google do not offer such services.

included another aspect. Ascentive had repeatedly com-
plained to Google about the use of
its trade mark
within the AdWords programme. Although it is com-
pletely unclear whether it was these complaints or
other reasons that led to the removal of Ascentive, the
company was effectively delisted at the end of February
2009 and was then disallowed from using Google’s
advertising service AdWords. Following the ECJ’s line
of reasoning, the removal of Ascentive would, as a con-
sequence of its absence in Google’s search results, lead
to an infringement of the advertising function.34

The reasoning of the ECJ is also interesting when

viewed from the advertisers’ perspective

Ascentive, however, based its strategy upon another
argument. The company wanted to be listed on Google
again, but did not allege that Google had abused its
market power, as has been claimed in other cases
before.35 Ascentive instead argued that users would
expect, when entering a trade mark as a query into
Google, to ﬁnd the website of the trade mark owner
within the search results. As a consequence, Google
would confuse users through its delisting and thus
infringe the claimant’s trade mark rights.

The reasoning of the ECJ is also interesting when
viewed from the advertisers’ perspective. A third-party
advertiser, booking a trade mark as a keyword, would
be obliged to check if the trade mark owner’s website is
shown inside the search results so as to avoid violating
the trade mark’s advertising function. This could prove
difﬁcult,
since the standard option ‘broad match’
makes it hard to predict which searches for trade
marked terms will lead to the display of the ad.36 As a
consequence, an advertiser will most likely not perform
such a check because, even if he does so, there is no
guarantee that the website of the trade mark holder

34 Another idea would be to force Google to stop selling a company’s trade

marks as keywords after it is delisted. This would be an option at least for
trade marks with reputation.

35 See Ott, ‘Die Entwicklung des Suchmaschinen- und Hyperlink-Rechts im
Jahr 2007’ WRP 2008, 393, 406 ff.; ‘Ich will hier rein! Suchmaschinen und
das Kartellrecht’ MMR 2006, 195 ss; ‘Marktbeherrschende und o¨ffentlich-
rechtliche Suchmaschinen’ K&R 2007, 375 ss.

36 Although Google does not tell advertisers ex ante which keyword will
trigger their ads, if they are using the standard keyword option ‘broad
match’, it supplies them with a ‘Search Query Performance report’, which
tells them ex post which keywords have triggered their ads. Search Query

will also be shown in subsequent
Changes in the search results happen often, eg due to
adjustments in Google’s ranking algorithm. Thus, as
soon as the trade mark holder disappears from the
search result, the third party advertiser would infringe
the trade mark owners’ rights.

To avoid the situation elaborated above, the ECJ’s
judgment could also be interpreted in such a way that
it would be sufﬁcient for the trade mark owner to be
able to be displayed in the search results. Whether the
trade mark owner is effectively displayed would be irre-
levant. The Court’s use of the word ‘usually’ could be
seen to support such an interpretation. Unfortunately,
even then the problem would remain that the Court’s
general assumption, for which it presented no evidence
at all, is most probably not true. Proprietorship of a
trade mark alone does not inﬂuence the ranking of
websites on Google. Readers are, at this point, encour-
aged to search for any trade mark registered at their
national patent ofﬁce37 through their respective Google
site (eg www.google.co.uk) and to hunt for the trade
mark owner in the search results.38 These searches
might lead to various results, some of which are clearly
not in line with the ECJ’s argumentation.

Entities such as the claimants in the cases at hand,
who have sufﬁcient resources to litigate a fundamental
question of trade mark law before the ECJ, might be
able to allocate enough resources for branding and
search engine optimization to be prominently displayed
within the search results. The authors are, however,
aware that
function as a
general rule. Thus it must be borne in mind that the
ECJ has not even considered the case of a trade mark
owner who does not have a website of its own. Most
‘big’ companies do, but eg about 20% of all Austrian
companies do not and there are probably a number of
trade mark owners among them.39

supposition cannot

this

So to conclude, the explanation of its argument with
the ‘usually’ provided visibility of
the trade mark
owner leaves room for two interpretations. The ﬁrst is

Ofﬁce of the European Union, http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/
RequestManager/en_SearchBasic. For Austrian trade marks, unfortunately
no such online services are available.

38 For example, when searching on Google for ‘Vo¨slauer Balance’, a

ﬂavoured Austrian mineral water (int. Trade Mark No. 859747), the
website of the trade mark owner does not appear on the ﬁrst page
of Google’s results, as the page http://www.vo¨slauer.com is entirely
programmed in ‘Flash’ and thus cannot properly be indexed by Google.
Simple SEO services, such eg the modiﬁcation of the pages ,noscript.
tag, would increase the ranking of the website.

that visibility is a de facto requirement. This interpret-
ation would, however, lead to a large number of unan-
swered questions. The second is that the Court right
away assumes visibility. Such a view would be based on
a highly questionable presumption, which is hard to
accept.

Establishment of the proof of visibility
We look forward to seeing how lawyers all over Europe
will react to the decision and if they will be able to
convince national courts of the idea that there is still
room left for the interpretation of the advertising func-
tion in the context of keyword advertising. If they
succeed in doing so,
favourable decisions for trade
mark owners might follow. To reach this goal, lawyers
might point to eye-tracking studies, which are used to
demonstrate users’ (visual) perception of search results
and advertisements. Their relevance, however,
is not
undisputed.40

According to one eye-tracking study, issued by an
Austrian company, ads placed above the search result
(Top-Ad) receive almost as much attention (93%) as
the ﬁrst (organic) search results (95%).41 Thus, if the
website of the trade mark owner is not located within
the users ﬁeld of attention, which means among the
ﬁrst two search results (the so-called ‘Golden-Triangle’),
a competitor might actually receive more attention
than the trade mark owner.

The eight and the ninth search results are only regis-
tered by every third user.42 In the cases decided by the
ECJ so far, the trade mark owner was always displayed
as the ﬁrst search result (the ECJ cautiously referred to
as ‘in one of
this is,
however, not the case, a prudent lawyer, displaying
empirical evidence, might succeed in convincing a
national court of a trade mark infringement.

the highest positions’).43 If

40 The ‘mind-eye’ theory is based on the assumption that an object viewed
is at the same time also the objective of cognitive reception. This thesis is
partly contradicted by the hypothesis of ‘Inattentional Blindness’. This
hypothesis stipulates that, while being occupied with a task and thus
diverting attention to it, users fail to perceive unexpected information or
information obviously not related to the task, even if it appears at
ﬁxation and is thus optically perceived by the users. In the context
of online advertising, this means that users’s speed in perceiving ads
diminishes if their brains have ‘learnt’ during previous searches that
the information shown in the areas of the screen where ads are usually
displayed is not relevant to their search task. Although the information is
ﬁxated upon by the eye, it is not subject to the users’ attention and thus
not consciously perceived.

Please see Benway/Lane, ‘Banner Blindness: Web Searchers Often Miss
“Obvious” Links’, http://www.internettg.org/dec98/banner_blindness.html;
Simons/Chabris, ‘Gorillas in Our Midst: Sustained Inattentional
Blindness for Dynamic Events’, Perception 1999, 1059 ss; Bruke et al.,
‘High-cost Banner Blindness: Ads Increase Perceived Workload, Hinder
Visual Search, and are Forgotten’, ACM 2005, 425; Duchowski, Eye

Considering that only a small number of users actu-
ally pay attention to the Side-Ads on the right-hand
side of the search result page, the following differen-
tiations could be made:
† If the website of the trade mark owner is displayed
as the ﬁrst or the second result in the search results,
visibility is guaranteed.
† If the website of the trade mark owner is displayed
between positions 3 and 10, visibility against the
the
Side-Ads is guaranteed, not however against
Top-Ads.
† If the website of the trade mark owner is not dis-
played among the ﬁrst 10 search results, it receives
insufﬁcient visibility and the advertising function is
adversely affected.

Taking into account that advertisers can only inﬂuence
the position of an ad to a certain degree and that
search results are not static, the existence of a trade
mark infringement would be subject to continuous
change,

Facts and assumptions
In the future, an impairment/adverse effect of
the
advertising function will only be able to be ruled out if
the visibility of the website of the trade mark owner in

new lawsuits might lead to fact-speciﬁc case-by-case

The liability of Google
The decision of the ECJ
The Court correctly stated that Google’s AdWords
service is an ‘information society service’
in the
meaning of the E-Commerce Directive,44 as it provides
means of electronic equipment for the processing and
storage of data at the individual request of a recipient
(para 110). But
the liability exemption as a host-
provider according to Article 14 ECD is only applicable
if this service is of a ‘mere technical, automatic and
passive nature’, which implies
service
provider ‘has neither knowledge of nor control over the
information which is transmitted or stored’ (para 113).
The fact
to
payment or that it provides ‘general information’ to the
advertiser ‘cannot have the effect of depriving Google
the exemption . . .’ (para 116). Previous national
of
decisions, especially from France, as well as the opinion
of
the Advocate General, have expressed different
views.45

issue, which is left

for the national
courts to decide, is whether or not AdWords remained
neutral in the course of drafting the text of the ad
and in the establishment or selection of keywords
(para 118).

Criticism and questions left unanswered
One should analyse what the ECJ has not said and
which questions it has left untouched. For example, the
Court did not comment on the scope of liability pro-
tection. This has already been interpreted by some
authors as a possible hint that the ECJ, as opposed to
the German Federal Supreme Court, considers interim
injunctions to be covered by the liability exemptions.46
The Court does not touch on the question of whether
the (analogous) application of the liability exemption
to search engines is permissible. This is a highly contro-

The decision of whether Google is to enjoy the liab-
ility exemption rests with the national courts, which
must decide now whether Google is a ‘neutral’ service.
Taking into consideration Recital 42 of
the ECD,
Google must neither have ‘knowledge of nor control
over the information which is transmitted or stored’.
However, as long as Google has no actual knowledge of
the keyword chosen by an advertiser or his or her
message,
it appears unlikely that the service will be
found not to be neutral. Regarding the requirement of
‘control over the information’, it is already negated by
the provider’s ability to maintain his system properly
and to delete particular ads. The requirement of

The auctioning of keywords in the course of ‘sealed
second bid options’ is a routine procedure on the inter-
net.48 Analysed in detail, every service offered by
Google in the course of booking keywords and the sub-
sequent display of the ads qualiﬁes as being purely
technical and thus neutral. For example, the Keyword
Tool has drawn a considerable amount of criticism in
France, where it has been subject to change. While the
tool used to be available exclusively within AdWords, it
has now been transformed into the publicly available
Search Based Keyword Tool, whose focus has clearly
shifted from suggesting additional keywords to provid-
ing advertisers with ‘ideas’ as to how they can improve
their advertising campaign based on the content of
their website.49

Google is thus exempted from liability in accordance
with 47 USC §230.50

Outlook
There are two more AdWords cases upon which the
ECJ must decide. They stem from the Hoge Raad
der Nederlanden51 and from the High Court of
Justice for England and Wales.52 The answers to the

remaining references are largely predictable and will,
if the ECJ remains cryptic, not help to clarify the
subject nor lead to the much desired legal certainty.
Thus we are left to see what conclusion the referring
national courts will draw from the decisions. Con-
cerning the French case, a jurist noticed:
‘You must
bear in mind that the court is in France, the claimant
is French, the defendant is American. Where do you
think this will lead?’53
