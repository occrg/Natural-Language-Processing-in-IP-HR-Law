Due cause
Ilanah Fhima*

1. Introduction
Article 5(2) of the Trade Marks Directive1 reads:

Any Member State may also provide that the proprietor
shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his
consent from using in the course of trade any sign which is
identical with, or similar to, the trade mark in relation to
goods or services which are not similar to those for which
the trade mark is registered, where the latter has a reputa-
tion in the Member State and where use of that sign
without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimen-
tal to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade
mark. [Emphasis added]

Due cause has had something of a renaissance over the
past few years. Until very recently it was assumed that
due cause under the Trade Marks Directive should be
interpreted in the same way as it had been in the pre-
harmonization Benelux law, where it was limited to
situations where the junior user was compelled to use
the mark in question or had an earlier right to do so.
This approach deprived the dilution/unfair advantage
provision of the Directive of an important counterbal-
ance at a time when unfair advantage was interpreted
in the recent InterÔ¨Çora2 and
expansively. However,
Leidseplein3 cases, the Court of Justice of the European
Union (CJEU) has made it clear that due cause is an
autonomous concept, and not restricted to the scope of
the old Benelux provision. Instead, the CJEU has spoken
of due cause as allowing junior use that might otherwise
infringe, but amounts to fair competition and has held
that it provides an entry point for a consideration of the
subjective intentions of the junior user. The CJEU has
also explained that rather than being an ‚Äòadd on‚Äô, due
cause plays a central role in counterbalancing the width
of the dilution/unfair advantage action. At the same time,
though, it has suggested that due cause may not apply
when certain of the very harms mentioned in Art. 5(2)
occur. This brings into question the utility of the provi-
sion in many dilution cases, particularly when taken in

 Due cause is the inbuilt exception to the Trade
Mark Directive‚Äôs dilution and unfair advantage
provision. Until recently, it was believed that it
should be interpreted restrictively, following the
pre-harmonization Benelux approach. However,
this has been cast into doubt by two recent Court
of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) cases.

 This article examines the extent of ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô in
the light of InterÔ¨Çora, Leidseplein and how those
cases have been received and interpreted by the
UK courts. It is argued that, while ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô is
certainly understood as a wider concept than it has
in the past, courts in the UK remain relatively cau-
tious about its breadth. It is further argued that, in
the light of the CJEU‚Äôs jurisprudence, ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô
has particular application in unfair advantage
cases, but may be less relevant, or even unavailable,
where there is blurring or tarnishment.

 Nevertheless, there is still the potential for ‚Äòdue
cause‚Äô to further develop into a more Ô¨Çexible tool,
particularly in relation to alleviating the strictness
of the CJEU‚Äôs approach to unfair advantage.

conjunction with the way in which the ‚Äòhonest practices‚Äô
proviso to the general defences has been interpreted.

This article begins by examining the old Benelux
approach, and explains why it was unsuitable in the
European context. It then conducts a detailed analysis of

their proper scope. These cases provide clear pointers as
to the CJEU‚Äôs direction of travel, but also leave consider-
able uncertainty (and potential) as to the scope of due
cause. Consequently, the article concludes with a consid-
eration of how the CJEU‚Äôs recent due cause case law has
been received by courts in the UK and contemplates
what this may mean for the future of due cause. The rela-
tionship between ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô and the ‚Äòhonest practices
proviso‚Äô is also considered.

2. What was ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô?
The Benelux Court4 was asked to elucidate the meaning
of ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åable grounds‚Äô under Section 13A(1) of the
Benelux Uniform Trade Mark Act. That section read:

Without prejudice to the rights arising from civil liability
under ordinary law, the trade mark owner may, on the
ground of his exclusive rights, oppose:

1. any use which is made of the trade mark or a resem-
bling sign in respect of the classes of goods for which
the trade mark has been registered, or in respect of
similar goods;

2. any other use which is made commercially of the
trade mark or of a resembling sign without justiÔ¨Åable
grounds and in such circumstances that damages
may be inÔ¨Çicted on the trade mark owner.

The defendant, Colgate-Palmolive, had argued that it did
have ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åable grounds‚Äô for the use of a mark similar to
the CLAREYN gin mark, that is, that the KLAREIN mark
was particularly suitable for use on detergents since ‚Äòklar‚Äô
meant quick, ready or Ô¨Ånished while ‚Äòrein‚Äô meant clean
or fresh. Moreover, Colgate-Palmolive had been using
the KLAREIN mark outside the Netherlands well before
Lucas Bols had begun using the CLAREYN mark.
However, these grounds were rejected by the Benelux
Court. The court adopted a narrow approach to when
there will be ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åable grounds‚Äô limited to where there
exists ‚Äòsuch a necessity for the user to employ that device
that it cannot reasonably be required of him to refrain
from that use‚Äô, even though the use will cause damage to
the senior trade mark owner. Alternatively, use might be
justiÔ¨Åed where the junior user was entitled to use the
mark in his own right, although this does not appear to
have automatically amounted to a justiÔ¨Åcation.5 Indeed,
in this case, the Benelux Court called on the referring
court to consider the degree of damage likely to be

suffered by the senior user before accepting a prior trade
mark registration as providing ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åable grounds‚Äô.6

The rationale behind this strict approach was based on
the fact that a trade mark was an ‚Äòexclusive right‚Äô and a
strong right, as evidence by the scope of protection of-
fered by Section 13.7 Perhaps there is a hint in this justiÔ¨Å-
cation of the divergence that was to happen more than
30 years later: CJEU case law has emphasized that, under
the harmonized regime, trade marks do not confer abso-
lute rights, but rather grant a trade mark owner the power
to enforce his mark necessary to the extent necessary to
protect the way that his mark functions. Indeed,
in
Leidseplein the CJEU emphasized the role of ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô
in establishing a balance between the parties‚Äô needs.
Moreover, to the extent that the scope of Art. 13 was used
to justify a narrow exception, it is notable that under Art.
13(1) the protection granted where marks and goods were
similar was automatic, whereas in the harmonized regime,
confusion is mentioned explicitly as a requirement.

Despite these differences, it is not surprising that,
given the similarity in wording between Art. 13A and
Art. 5(2) of the Trade Marks Directive, and given the
dearth of CJEU-level guidance at the time, it was as-
sumed in the UK that the ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô requirement un-
der the Directive should be interpreted in the same way
as the ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åable grounds‚Äô clause of Art. 13A.
In
Premier Brands v Typhoon,8 the junior user had chosen
the mark TYPHOON because it was easily pronounced
and memorable, had ‚Äòoriental connotations‚Äô and was
understandable in the East and the West (the goods
were sourced in the Far East and sold in the UK).9 Had
there been prima facie Art. 5(2) infringement, the ju-
nior user‚Äôs reasons for choosing the mark would not
amount to ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô. While it was accepted that he
had chosen the mark in good faith, rather than to take
advantage of or harm the senior mark, good faith alone
as due cause was unacceptable.10 It would make the
outcome of cases where a mark could be seriously
harmed depend on the subjective intentions of a third
party, and could incentivize junior users to do minimal
due diligence. Moreover, it had to be shown that the ju-
nior user had due cause to harm another‚Äôs mark, not
just due cause to choose his sign. Instead Neuberger J
(as he then was) cited the Benelux Court‚Äôs options of
compulsion or prior right as ‚Äòthe approach which
should be adopted‚Äô to the interpretation of ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô
given the similarities between the two provisions.11

3. What is ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô?

In the absence of any statement to the contrary from
the CJEU, the approach adopted in Premier Brands was
assumed to be the correct one. The CJEU made no
comment on the ambit of the scope of ‚Äòdue case‚Äô for
is hard to know whether this was
many years. It
through satisfaction with the state of
the law, or
whether it was just because the opportunity to deÔ¨Åne
its scope did not occur. The CJEU cannot deÔ¨Åne mat-
ters of its own instigation and so the opportunity to
provide an interpretation of ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô most likely did
not arise. Initially, very few references were made re-
garding Art. 5(2), and when they did start to come
through, prima facie infringement was deÔ¨Åned restric-
tively, meaning that there was no need for the court to
deÔ¨Åne due cause because infringement was unlikely to
be made out.12 This changed though once the CJEU de-
Ô¨Åned unfair advantage broadly to include any trade
mark-derived advantage that was unremunerated.13
Now courts were faced with situations where Art. 5(2)
infringement was highly likely to be found, and in cir-
cumstances that some argued would have a deleterious
effect on free and fair competition.14

Such a situation arose in InterÔ¨Çora.15 The junior
user, Marks & Spencer, had purchased the senior mark
INTERFLORA as an advertising keyword, even though
it was not part of the senior user‚Äôs Ô¨Çoral distribution
network. This was prima facie Art. 5(2) infringement:
there was an advantage conferred on Marks & Spencer
because consumers using INTERFLORA as a search
term, and potentially intending to purchase Ô¨Çowers
from InterÔ¨Çora, would be confronted with the junior
user‚Äôs advertisements. As a result, they might come to
make purchases from the junior user‚Äôs website in-
stead.16 Since the junior user had not paid the senior
user any compensation for such use, this advantage was
counted, following L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure,17 as unfair.18 As
the Advocate General noted, such a result would spell
the end of keyword advertising.19 The CJEU seemed
unhappy with this result, and so it effectively went on
to undo it by holding that, despite any unfair advantage,
there was due cause where the junior user ‚Äòputs for-
ward . . . an alternative to the goods or services of the

the trade mark was a reputation‚Äô.20
proprietor of
However, offering an alternative would only be acceptable
where the offer did not cause dilution or tarnishment,
did not affect the functions of the senior mark (presum-
ably causing confusion would be the prime example of
use that would affect those functions) and did not offer a
‚Äòmere imitation‚Äô of the senior goods or services.21

While the CJEU made no mention of the Benelux
deÔ¨Ånition, such an approach clearly falls outside the sit-
uations mentioned there, in that Marks & Spencer had
no earlier right to the INTERFLORA mark and was in
no way compelled to use it. This suggests a far more ex-
pansive role for ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô. This is underscored by the
court‚Äôs explanation for allowing such use, namely ‚Äòsuch
use falls, as a rule, within the ambit of fair competition
in the sector for the goods or services concerned‚Äô.22
There is the tantalizing suggestion here that use which
is accordance with ‚Äòfair competition‚Äô may be considered
to have ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô. This is an open term which creates
a myriad of possibilities (and uncertainties) as to its
scope.

However, the court has potentially limited the use of
this deÔ¨Ånition of due cause to unfair advantage cases,
by requiring that the junior user not have caused tarn-
ishment or blurring,23 which essentially parallel the det-
riment to repute and distinctive character forms of
infringement. This would be an odd result given that it
has always been assumed that due cause qualiÔ¨Åes all
the forms of
infringement mentioned in Art. 5(2).
Technically though, it is possible, although undesirable,
to read ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô as limited to unfair advantage since
it appears prior to unfair advantage and is separated
from the two forms of detriment by a coma and an ‚Äòor‚Äô.
The provision reads:

where use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advan-
tage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the
repute of the trade mark.

This expansive deÔ¨Ånition of ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô could have
been limited to the internet context. However,
in
Leidseplein,24 the CJEU made it clear that it was of gen-
eral application and played an integral role in the way
in which Art. 5(2) is structured.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2017, Vol. 12, No. 11

The junior user, a Mr de Vries, had owned various
marks containing the term BULLDOG for beverage-
related goods in Class 32, the earliest registration of
which was 14 July 1983. He used his marks for energy
drinks. He had however used THE BULLDOG as a trade
name for hotels, restaurants and cafe¬¥s prior to 1983. The
senior user had Ô¨Åled RED BULL for non-alcoholic drinks
in Class 32 on 11 July 1983 (and so, three days before the
junior user‚Äôs Ô¨Årst application).

It seems to have been admitted that the junior use
for the energy drinks amounted to unfair advantage.25
However, the question arose whether the junior user‚Äôs
earlier use could amount to due cause, given that it was
in good faith. The senior user attempted to argue that
‚Äòdue cause‚Äô should be limited to the old Benelux deÔ¨Åni-
tion of objectively overriding reasons. However, this
was rejected by the CJEU, which explained that the
concept of due cause must be interpreted ‚Äòin the light
of the overall scheme and objectives of the system of
which it forms a part‚Äô.26 While Art. 5 does grant an
exclusive right to trade mark owners, this only goes as
far as allowing the trade mark owner to protect his
speciÔ¨Åc interests in his trade mark of ensuring that
the mark can fulÔ¨Ål its functions. Thus, the scope of
protection is limited to whether there is an effect on the
function of the mark. While the protection under Art.
5(2) must be at least as extensive as that provided for
similar and identical goods pursuant to Art. 5(1), this
does not mean that due cause must be interpreted
restrictively. Instead, this is ensured by the fact that the
signs need not be identical, as per Art. 5(1)(a) and there
is no need for confusion, as per Art. 5(1)(b). Moreover,
there is no need to prove any sort of harm to the senior
mark,
there is unfair advantage. To maintain a
balance between a trade mark owner‚Äôs interests and
those of third parties, particularly given the existence of
the unfair advantage action, due cause is included and
must cover both subjective and objectively overriding
reasons for the use of the mark in question.27

if

In a situation of prior use by the junior user, it was
necessary to look at two factors to establish ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô
which justiÔ¨Åed the taking of unfair advantage. These
were: Ô¨Årst the reputation of the junior sign amongst the
general public and secondly, the proximity of the senior
goods to those for which the junior mark had a reputa-
tion - the closer the prior goods to the contested goods,
the more needed there will be for the junior user to use
the mark for those contested goods.28

This decision is important for a number of reasons.
Perhaps most importantly, in explicitly stating that the

narrow Benelux approach to ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô is not the cor-
rect way to interpret the EU Directive, it shows that
InterÔ¨Çora was not an aberration, or limited to the inter-
net context. Instead, the court explained how due cause
is an inbuilt ‚Äòcheck‚Äô to the scope of the protection of-
fered by Art. 5(2), and so plays a fundamental role in the
structure of the provision, rather than being a dispens-
able ‚Äòadd on‚Äô. Secondly, in allowing a consideration of
subjective overriding reasons, it provides an additional
example, other than fair competition, of when junior use
will be ‚Äòwith due cause‚Äô. Finally, the court twice made an
explicit link between due cause an unfair advantage spe-
ciÔ¨Åcally. At paragraph 44, the Court noted:

Where the proprietor of the mark with a reputation has
demonstrated the existence of one of the forms of injury
referred to in Article 5(2) of Directive 89/104 and, in par-
ticular, has shown that unfair advantage has been taken of
the distinctive character or the repute of that mark, the onus
is on the third party using a sign similar to the mark with a
reputation to establish that he has due cause for using such
a sign . . .. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, at paragraph 53, the court spoke of the due
cause justifying the unfair advantage taken of the senior
mark, without mentioning it as justifying the other
forms of harm:

In order to determine whether the use by a third party,
before a trade mark with a reputation was Ô¨Åled, of a sign
similar to that mark may constitute ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô, within the
meaning of Article 5(2) of Directive 89/104, and justify the
fact that that third party takes advantage of the repute of
that mark, the referring court must carry out an assess-
ment,
two factors.
[Emphasis added]

taking into account,

in particular,

This focus on unfair advantage could be attributed to
the nature of the activity undertaken by Mr de Vries,
though ordinarily one would expect the CJEU to speak
in the abstract in an Article 234 TFEU (Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union) reference. Instead,
it is submitted that this may be tacit recognition by the
court that ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô is particularly valuable in undo-
ing the width of the ‚Äòunfairness‚Äô element of unfair ad-
vantage, which catches so many activities, without
considering their social beneÔ¨Åt, or their necessity to the
junior user. The argument for ‚Äòdue cause‚Äô in relation to
detriment is not quite as compelling, given that harm
has been caused to the senior user or its mark.

The combined effect of InterÔ¨Çora and Leidseplein is
to create a state of signiÔ¨Åcant uncertainty. There is a
suggestion that the fact that the junior user is in good

faith, or is in accordance with fair competition may
amount to due cause, but what do these very wide
terms mean in practice? Also, what is the importance of
the CJEU‚Äôs repeated emphasis of the special relationship
between due cause an unfair advantage? In particular,
what does this mean for the relevance of due cause in
relation to detriment to distinctive character or repute?

4. Reception by UK courts

Thus far there are only a handful of cases regarding how
due cause should be interpreted in the light of CJEU re-
cent jurisprudence. This is perhaps unsurprising given
that the meaning of due cause only arises in the context
of a senior mark with a reputation, and only once it has
been demonstrated that there was a link that would lead
to unfair advantage or one of the forms of detriment.29

General approach

It was clear from the outset that CJEU recent jurispru-
dence denoted a seachange in the approach to ‚Äòdue
cause‚Äô. Thus, even before Leidseplein, in Specsavers30 the
Court of Appeal of England and Wales noted, that there
had been ‚Äòa development by the Court of Justice of its
jurisprudence on the scope of Article 9(1)(c)‚Äô in that
there could be situations in which, despite the junior
user adopting a mark with the intention of deriving an
advantage from it and without paying compensation
for that advantage, it would still be necessary to con-
sider whether the use was with due cause because it
amounted to fair competition.31 However, there have
been differing approaches as to just how far the CJEU‚Äôs
new attitude goes. The two cases described below dem-
onstrate that there the courts in the UK have taken dif-
fering views to just how much Ô¨Çexibility is inherent in
the CJEU‚Äôs new approach to due cause.

One example of due cause in action can be seen in
Comic Enterprises.32 The senior user registered a Ô¨Ågura-
tive mark containing the words THE GLEE CLUB for
various forms of entertainment services, including com-
edy clubs and live shows in 2001. In 2009, the junior
user
launched a highly successful musical comedy

So, for example, in Tartan Army Ltd v Sett GmbH & Ors [2017] CSOH
22, para 166 the Court of Sessions did not consider whether due cause
arose from the fact that the term TARTAN ARMY has been in prior use
amongst the general media before it was registered as a trade mark since
the senior mark lacked an enhanced reputation and association with the
junior use was unlikely. Even in Argos Ltd v Argos Systems Inc [2017]
EWHC 231 (Ch), the due cause discussion was obiter dictum since any
advantage obtained by the junior user from the increased trafÔ¨Åc to its
website was not unfair, and thus there was no Section 10(3)
infringement.

television series about a US high school singing club. The
programme was named Glee. In relation to Section
10(2), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales found
that there was ‚Äòwrong way round confusion‚Äô: instead of
consumers believing that the junior user‚Äôs services origi-
nated with the senior user, they believed that the senior
user‚Äôs comedy clubs were somehow connected with the
junior television show.33 For the purposes of Section
10(3), this confusion was evidence of association between
the two marks and amounted to detriment to distinctive
character. Consumers of a supposedly edgy comedy club
were put off attending by the mistaken belief that it was
linked to the more mainstream Glee
television
programme.34

With prima facie dilution established, the court went
on to consider due cause. First, the junior user, Fox,
argued that its use had been in good faith given that the
subject matter of its television series was a glee club.
Although the Court of Appeal accepted that good
faith was relevant to establishing due cause, this was
outweighed by the fact that the junior use was causing
confusion.35 This approach suggests that use in good
faith does not, of itself, amount to due cause. There is a
degree of circularity in the Court of Appeal‚Äôs Ô¨Ånding that
there cannot be due cause because of the confusion. After
all, this is the very detriment which due cause is intended
to counterbalance. This unsatisfactory state of affairs very
much echoes the approach taken in InterÔ¨Çora.

The junior user also attempted to support due cause
based upon a freedom of speech argument: given the
subject matter of the television series, there was an artis-
tic connection between the content of the show and glee
clubs, and to restrain the use of the term interfered with
the junior user‚Äôs fundamental rights. This failed because
an alternative could have been chosen.36 The argument
is noteworthy, as it harks back (presumably unintention-
ally) to the unsuccessful argument in Lucas Bols that the
descriptive elements of the KLAREIN mark made it
particularly suitable for use on the cleaning products in
question. Finally, an argument that there were no mate-
rial similarities between the parties‚Äô services was rejected
as being factually incorrect.37

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2017, Vol. 12, No. 11

It is true that Comic Enterprises adopts the technical
detail inherent in InterÔ¨Çora and Leidseplein in recogniz-
ing good faith as helpful to a due cause case. Arguably,
however, it does not adopt the spirit given that there is
no real consideration of how due cause may act to
counterbalance the width of Section 10(3). Instead, the
opposite is true, with the Ô¨Ånding of confusion and
hence detriment to distinctive character being used to
rule out due cause. One way in which the judgment is
expansive is that it applies due cause outside the con-
text of unfair advantage, although it is questionable
how useful this is, given the approach taken to due
cause where detriment is present.

A more Ô¨Çexible approach is evident in Argos v Argos.38
The senior user was the owner of the well-known cata-
logue store, which owned the word mark ARGOS for,
inter alia, advertising services. The junior user was a US
computer aided design company which also traded under
the ARGOS name (Argos being a character in Greek
mythology). The junior user found that it had a signiÔ¨Å-
cant amount of mistaken trafÔ¨Åc to its website, www.argos.
com, from UK consumers. The UK consumers were
searching for the website of the UK retailer, to be found
at www.argos.co.uk. The junior user realized that it was
possible to generate revenue from this misdirected trafÔ¨Åc,
and added Google‚Äôs Adsense advertising programme to
its non-US website. The senior user objected, arguing
inter alia that this conferred an unfair advantage on the
junior user, as it was proÔ¨Åting from the advertising placed
by Google on its site.

The UK trade mark owner‚Äôs argument was rejected
by the High Court of England and Wales. First, the evi-
dence showed that consumers were not making a link
between the junior website and the senior user, since
visits from the UK were Ô¨Çeeting, and the contents of
the site could not be mistaken for the catalogue store.39
There was also no unfair advantage. The junior user
had done nothing to seek out the advantage: instead it
had chosen the internationally available domain name
and the appearance of any advertisements for the senior
user would have resulted from the senior user‚Äôs Adsense
decisions. Ultimately, the junior user gained no real
advantage from ‚Äòthe alleged riding on the coat-tails‚Äô of
the senior user‚Äôs reputation in the ARGOS mark.
Instead, it took part in a normal commercial advertising

programme and utilized web trafÔ¨Åc that the junior user
had not sought out. Indeed, it actually caused the ju-
nior user some problems (and cost) in terms of the
bandwidth required to sustain the website in the light
of the mistaken visitors from the UK.40 Given the very
different appearance of the websites, the junior use was
also unlikely to be detrimental to the distinctive charac-
ter or repute of the senior mark.41

Since there was no Section 10(3) injury, the due cause
issue did not technically arise, and the judge, Richard
Spearman QC, expressed some unwillingness to make
Ô¨Åndings on this issue.42 However, he did make several
general comments suggestive of a more Ô¨Çexible approach
to due cause. At the abstract level, he suggested a prefer-
ence of the junior user‚Äôs argument that due cause should
not be limited to the Leidseplein situation of prior junior
use.43 This opens the way for a more generalized ap-
proach based on fair competition, as in InterÔ¨Çora. On
the speciÔ¨Åc facts, he saw no problem in the junior user
making money from mistakes that were out of its con-
trol, nor any issue with the decision to join the Adsense
scheme, once the possibility of Ô¨Ånancial beneÔ¨Åt was real-
ized.44 Interestingly, the judge referred to this decision as
being ‚Äòin accordance with honest practices‚Äô.45 While this
element of the decision is obiter, the use of such termi-
nology suggests a far more Ô¨Çexible, competition-based
approach to due cause. Such an approach may enable
‚Äòdue cause‚Äô to be adopted to differing circumstances, and
may not be restricted by considerations of detail, as in,
some of the cases described below.

Examples

Perhaps the best way to understand the impact of the
new approach so far is to consider how it has been ap-
plied to concrete examples. A note of caution is required,
though. Any analysis of the case law may not identify the
entire scope of due cause because it is dependent on
which factual scenarios arise before the courts. Connected
with this is that fact that any one factual scenario is made
up of the objective situation and the way in which the
particular junior user has conducted itself. This latter
consideration may place a particularly important role
here because the CJEU has instructed us to consider the
subjective approach taken by the junior user in determin-
ing whether there is due cause.

Ibid, para 305. A seemingly analogous position was adopted in The
London Taxi Corporation Limited trading as the London Taxi Company v
Frazer-Nash Research Limited and Ecotive Limited [2016] EWHC 52
(Ch). At para 268, Arnold J concluded that, had there been detriment or
unfair advantage, it would not have been necessary to consider due cause
separately because all the relevant factors would be considered under the
descriptive use defence.

Good faith and non-UK prior use
As mentioned above, in Comic Enterprises46 the Court
of Appeal accepted that good faith in the use and/or
adoption of the junior sign can be relevant to due
cause. The consideration of good faith has frequently
been linked with prior use of the sign by the junior
user. In a number of the cases that have arisen in the
UK, the use of the junior sign has developed over a
number of years, without knowledge of the senior sign
and in a different jurisdiction (usually the USA). This
was the case in Comic Enterprises,47 Pink,48 Argos49 and
Merck.50 The consideration of good faith for these
purposes has focused not upon whether the mark was
initially adopted in good faith, but rather on how the
junior user comported itself on entry into the territory
which brought it into conÔ¨Çict with the senior mark
(entry into the UK market in the Ô¨Årst two cases and
establishment of an online presence in the latter two
cases).

In Thomas Pink the junior user had run a chain of
clothing shops in the USA, named PINK, for many
years. However, in the UK, the senior user had a num-
ber of shops selling primarily shirts named THOMAS
PINK and the use of the junior PINK was found to lead
to confusion under Art. 9(1)(c).51 An argument of due
cause was rejected because, while the junior user had a
long history of use in the USA, when entering the UK
market it gave no thought to the senior user‚Äôs rights.
Despite the territorial nature of trade mark rights, it
had failed to conduct a trade mark search. It had also
misunderstood the extent of the senior user‚Äôs use of its
mark, which covered clothing other than shirts.52 In the
words of the judge, the PINK mark was ‚Äòadopted in
good faith but it was wrong‚Äô.53

Similarly, in Comic Enterprises54 there was no ques-
tion that when the junior user chose Glee as the name
of its television programme in the USA,
it did not
know about the senior user‚Äôs comedy clubs and there
was no reason why it should have. The problem arose
when, on entering the UK market, confusion arose.

Civ 41.

In Merck55 the development of the separate chemical
and pharmaceutical businesses which shared the name
MERCK was not impugned, and indeed, the two had co-
existed under various agreements for a number of years.
The Section 10(3) infringement arose not because of the
parallel existence of the two companies, but instead be-
cause of the operation of the junior user‚Äôs websites (use
on the internet and its ability to penetrate the senior
user‚Äôs market not having been foreseen by the 1970 co-
existence agreement). Use by the junior user of the sign
‚ÄòMERCK Be Well‚Äô on a ‚Äòglobal website‚Äô56 was labelled ‚Äòa
deliberate and transparent attempt to push the bound-
aries of a long established co-existence arrangement‚Äô.57

However, the opposite can be seen in the Argos
case.58 The US Argos business developed entirely inde-
pendently of the UK catalogue store and it did not target
its website at UK consumers. Any beneÔ¨Åt was the result
of misdirected trafÔ¨Åc over which it had no direct control.
The additional website visits were also a mixed blessing,
given the need to purchase additional bandwidth to
cope with the additional demand.59

Bad faith
Deliberate attempts to take advantage of another‚Äôs
goodwill have prevented Ô¨Åndings of due
cause.
This is apparent from the Merck case described above.60
It can also be seen in Specsavers v Asda, where the
junior user‚Äôs activities were described as ‚Äòintended to
beneÔ¨Åt from the power of attraction attaching to the
Specsavers brand and to exploit, without paying any
compensation, Specsavers‚Äô marketing efforts by convey-
ing to consumers that Asda offered real value in
the form of spectacle savings.‚Äô61 This was against a
background where the junior user was considered to
have been ‚Äòliving dangerously‚Äô
in selecting a logo
intended to be reminiscent of that of the senior user.62

the realm of due cause.64 The senior user owned various
trade marks containing the word SUPREME for animal
foodstuffs and objected to the junior use of the word
SUPREME for a product marketed as ‚ÄòMr Johnson‚Äôs
Supreme Rabbit Mix‚Äô. ‚ÄòSupreme‚Äô was used to denote
the fact that the food in question was superior to the
junior user‚Äôs ‚Äòstandard‚Äô rabbit food. Arnold J drew
attention to the fact that the sign had been used for
over 20 years as favourable to the junior user.65

On the other hand, in Azumi66 the fact that the
junior user‚Äôs impugned sign was the name of her dog
was found not to amount to due cause. Although it is
not made explicit, perhaps we can extrapolate from this
that any claim to due cause based on prior or parallel
use of a term must be use as a sign in relation to goods
or services (ie trade mark use), rather than something
more indirect.

Descriptive use
Descriptive use has been said to be a factor that contrib-
utes to a Ô¨Ånding of due cause. Thus, in Supreme the de-
scriptive nature of the word ‚Äòsupreme‚Äô was mentioned
favourably.67 However,
it clearly is not a dispositive
factor. For example, the fact that the junior mark, THE
UNITED KINGDOM UKULELE ORCHESTRA was de-
scriptive did not mean that the junior user had due cause
to use it.68 His Honour Judge Hacon suggested that such
descriptive considerations did not ‚Äòconstitute the sort of
fair
in
Specsavers‚Äô. Instead, the junior mark infringed the senior
mark: THE UKULELE ORCHESTRA OF GREAT
BRITAIN. Likewise, the descriptive nature of the term
GLEE in relation to the glee club featured in the junior
user‚Äôs television series did not prevent a Ô¨Ånding of lack of
due cause.69

competition contemplated by Kitchin LJ

It is submitted that failure to consider the descriptive
nature of junior marks is unfortunate, though under-
standable. If descriptiveness amounted to due cause in
and of itself, this would allow junior users to pleading de-
scriptiveness in situations where they have sought to take

if,

advantage or marks which are inherently descriptive but
have acquired distinctiveness. It is argued that it would be
clearer
following the objective reasons/subjective
considerations structure employed in Leidseplein,70 de-
scriptiveness was accepted as providing an objectively
overriding reason for using the junior mark, but concerns
about deliberate advantage or about harm were consid-
ered when examining the subjective position of the junior
user.

Mere comparison
In Specsavers71 it is suggested that creating a link with
the senior user‚Äôs particular product offering (in this
case value spectacles) gives the junior user a marketing
advantage that goes beyond offering alternatives as en-
visaged in InterÔ¨Çora.72 Presumably the difference is that
in InterÔ¨Çora the Adword service merely used the word
mark without explicitly capturing any of its branding
connotations, whereas in Specsavers, the junior user, by
referring to the senior user in its strapline ‚ÄòSpec savings
at Asda‚Äô sought to capture the senior brand offering,
and not just the mark qua indication of origin.

Confusion
In both Pink73 and Comic Enterprises,74 the fact that the
junior use caused confusion with the senior use is
treated as fatal to there being due cause. This is argu-
ably inherent in InterÔ¨Çora,75 but presents signiÔ¨Åcant dif-
Ô¨Åculties in the sort of situations that arose in those
cases, where a junior user with an established market
abroad seeks to enter into the UK market.

Proximity of goods
In Leidseplein, the proximity of the goods favoured due
cause, because it demonstrated that the junior user had
a legitimate interest in expanding his pre-existing offer-
ing into the senior user‚Äôs market76. However, in Pink77
and Comic Enterprises,78 proximity between the goods
mitigated against due cause. Indeed, in Pink, the court
used the fact that the junior mark was being used for

facts

to distinguish the

from
different products
Leidseplein. Once confusion is seen as ruling out due
cause, it is understandable why courts might look to
the relationship between the senior and junior goods.
However,
this would seem to be a misreading of
Leidseplein, where the focus is not so much on the rela-
tionship between the senior and junior goods, as on the
relationship between the junior prior goods and the
junior impugned goods‚Äîif they are linked, then this
suggests a good reason for the junior user‚Äôs choice to
expand into the senior market. Indeed, it is implicit in
InterÔ¨Çora, where both parties were selling Ô¨Çowers, that
even identity of goods can be compatible with a Ô¨Ånding
of due cause.

5. The relationship between due cause
and honest practices

One remaining area of uncertainty is the relationship
between due cause and the proviso to the Article 6 de-
fences, which are stated to need to be ‚Äòin accordance
with honest practices in industrial and commercial
matters‚Äô. The CJEU has not addressed this issue, al-
though it has been suggested post-Leidseplein that there
is an overlap between the two concepts.79 It is, however,
submitted that this cannot be automatically assumed.
According to the deÔ¨Ånition of
‚Äòhonest practices‚Äô
adopted in Gillette,80 use which takes unfair advantage
will not be in accordance with honest practices since
use which ‚Äòaffects the value of the trade mark by taking
unfair advantage of its distinctive character or repute‚Äô is
speciÔ¨Åcally mentioned as an example of an activity that
cannot be honest. According to L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure,81 un-
fair advantage should be read the same way according
to the CJEU across all its meanings, which would mean
that where there is unfair advantage for the purposes
of Art. 5(2), the junior use will, inevitably, not be in
accordance with honest practices. By contrast, due
cause is speciÔ¨Åcally picked out in Leidseplein as the
‚Äòantidote‚Äô to unfair advantage and its width. Instead,
there is a question mark, deriving from InterÔ¨Çora, over
whether due cause is available where there is blurring
or tarnishment. On the other hand, blurring is not
mentioned as a form of activity which is not in accor-
dance with honest practices in Gillette.82 It is thus pos-
sible to read CJEU jurisprudence so that the Art. 6

defences can be used in a case which involved prima
facie blurring but not unfair advantage. Instead, use
which prima facie takes unfair advantage will not in-
fringe at all if it is with due cause. This reading could
exclude prima facie tarnishment from beneÔ¨Åting from
any form of defence, since ‚Äòdenigration‚Äô of a trade mark
is mentioned as an example of an activity which is not
in accordance with honest practices83 while InterÔ¨Çora
suggested that use that tarnishes would not have due
cause. This could have worrying implications if in fu-
ture the courts read tarnishment to include situations
where a junior user (unjustiÔ¨Åably?) criticizes a trade
marked product, identifying it by its trade mark.

6. Conclusion

Due cause remains something of an enigma. There ap-
pears to be a clear message from the CJEU case law that
there is a desire to expand its scope, but it is unclear if
this is a desire to create a Ô¨Çexible standard to cover all
forms of fair competition (as in InterÔ¨Çora), or rather to
create something that focuses more speciÔ¨Åcally on the
justiÔ¨Åcations for the junior use (as in Leidseplein). There
is also the vexed question of how, if at all, due cause
should apply if the junior use injures the senior mark
through confusion or dilution. This plays into the ques-
tion of whether due cause applies primarily as a coun-
terbalance to the width of the unfair advantage action.

Courts in the UK have taken a relatively restrictive
approach to interpreting due cause. While they have
recognized the CJEU‚Äôs desire to expand its scope, for
the most part, they have added layers of detail which,
while not limited to the old Benelux approach, can
create obstacles to establishing due cause. It remains to
be seen whether this is in accordance with the CJEU‚Äôs
understanding of the revised scope of the provision,
but there is still some hope that due cause will remain
Ô¨Çexible and adaptive to new factual situations that
come before the courts. In particular, there remains the
potential for due cause to be developed as a tool to
undo some of the presumably unintended consequences
of L‚ÄôOreal v Bellure,84 and the CJEU‚Äôs Ô¨Ånding that any
unremunerated advantage is unfair. Most urgently,
comparative advertising would seem to be a clear candi-
date for being considered ‚Äòfair competition‚Äô under
InterÔ¨Çora.
