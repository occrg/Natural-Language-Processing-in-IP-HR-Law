Treating trade secrets as property:
a jurisprudential inquiry in search of coherency
Smriti Tripathi*

The property can be denied, but the conÔ¨Ådence cannot be!1

Introduction

Traditionally, the concept of trade secrets has been
seen as arising out of a contractual obligation. In this
sense, what required protection was the relation rather
than the information.2 However, in the mid- and late
19th century, this understanding underwent a shift and
the courts were tasked with the position to take.
Plaintiffs sought remedies under the breach of trust
law, breach of contract and property law. Granting
trade secrets protection under property law seemed
feasible without any hindrances. Indeed, over time
courts have relied on property law to provide plaintiffs
with remedies.3 However, a deeper analysis and com-
parison of trade secrets law and property law shows
that they are not really compatible. The main problem
is twofold: Ô¨Årst, the intangible nature of trade secrets;
secondly, the questionable validity of restraining agree-
ments pertaining to trade secrets. Thus, although a
trade secret is seen as a property for the purpose of
providing a remedy, can it ever qualify as such in the
real sense of the word?

Trade secrets

Understanding trade secrets

The building stones of trade secrets law were laid down
during industrialization, ie in a context that is very dif-
ferent from the one in place today. As trade and com-
merce expanded, so did competition and trade-related
issues. New mechanisms were set up to compete with

 Trade secrets law is a good example of how the ju-
risprudential conquest has afforded character to a
law on need-basis. Originated as a branch of con-
tract law, the courts have subsequently and easily
shifted to treating trade secrets as property during
the 19th century.

 This article submits that, if a structural and juris-
prudential enquiry is undertaken, then the theory
of treating trade secret as property is one that lacks
coherency. This is due to the intangible nature of
trade secrets and appears to have evolved only to
uphold the restraining clause so as to provide relief
to the plaintiff. The article provides an understand-
ing of trade secrets law and then indulges into a
brief, jurisprudential quest into theories of prop-
erty. Thereupon, it directly moves to the broader
question whether trade secrets can be treated as a
property in the real sense and for any purposes.
The problems are noted down and the points of
differences highlighted.

 The following analysis is a not a symposium on the
conÔ¨Çict between trade secrets and property law but
rather an inquisitive quest into both realms.

the ever-growing industrial world. The inception of
trade secret law was sometime around the middle of
the Nineteenth century as a part of common law of the

Protection of trade secrets has been granted under many heads, including
contract and breach of conÔ¨Ådence: see Ridsdale Ellis, Trade Secrets
(Baker, Voorhis New York 1953). See also Kim Lane Scheppele, Legal
Secrets: Equality and EfÔ¨Åciency in the Common Law (University of
Chicago Press Chicago YEAR) 240. In all these cases, whatever the claim
or the theory applied, protection was afforded to trade secret only when
the defendant knew the plaintiff and the claim arose from their relation-
ship. Scheppele points out that if A tells B a secret and B tells that secret
to C, and then C uses it, then C will not be liable for trade secret

misappropriation. Thus establishing the nexus of a relationship in gen-
eral. And most times than not, this ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô is that of conÔ¨Ådence
arising out of contractual obligations. However, when this C engages in
the intentional misappropriation then C will be liable as in Atlantic Wool
Combing Company v Norfolk Mills Inc, 357 F 2d 866 (1st Circuit 1966).
At this juncture, the author would like to clarify that since the mid-19th
century, the reliefs in trade secret cases were provided under the law of
contract, property, tort and equity; to name them broadly. Ibid.
However, this article analyses the treatment of trade secret only as prop-
erty. This does not mean that other branches are not recognized in this
article but that they are outside the intellectual quest of this article.

English Courts. The First Reinstatement of Torts of
19394 was the Ô¨Årst relevant clear codiÔ¨Åcation. As part of
the law of breach of conÔ¨Ådence, trade secrets law repre-
sented a relatively dormant
theorization until after
World War II.5 Before the war, disputes relating to con-
Ô¨Ådential information were adjudicated under common
law, just like any other dispute, and decided based on
general principles rather than treated as a special branch
of law.6 At the same time, in the USA, the following
policy was formulated by Justice Gray: ‚ÄòIt is the policy
of the law, for the advantage of the public, to encourage
invention and commercial enterprise.‚Äô7
and protect
Here, recognition was also afforded in terms of prop-
erty law.

India, on the other hand, still does not have a codi-
Ô¨Åed doctrine of trade secrets and the courts still rule on
relevant issues by relying on common law principles.
The elements of undisclosed information are laid down
in Article 39.28 of the Agreement on Trade-related
Aspects of International Property Law (TRIPS).9 Article
XVII of GATT10 and other related articles provide that
Member States are under no obligation to disclose con-
Ô¨Ådential information. This is complemented by s 2711
of
the Indian Contract Act 1872 in respect of
employer‚Äìemployee trade secrets.

DeÔ¨Åning the boundaries of trade secrets

Though the degree and the technicalities may vary,
there are some common basic elements for a piece of
information to qualify as a trade secret.12 In India, for
instance, although there is no legislation codifying trade
secrets law, the courts have been borrowing, developing
and establishing the elements of trade secret law by vir-
tue of the common law system. These elements are:
 A trade secret should contain information. This re-
quirement is practically as broad as it can get and
can cover a wide range of information such as for-
mulas,13 lists, customer details, patterns, processes,
etc.14 Whatever the owner deems valuable may qual-
ify as ‚Äòinformation‚Äô.

 The information must be secret,15 ie it should not be
publicly and generally known, although it does not need
to be ‚Äòunique‚Äô. Instead, the information in question
simply must not be generally known or easily accessible
to competitors and the public at large. However, if a
competitor somehow generates the same information
on its own or through reverse engineering,16 it would
not mean that the information ceases to be a secret.

 The information has commercial viability/value. This
means that, if the information is not protected, the

Moat (1851) 9 Hare 241 where the injunctions granted to the plaintiff for
preserving their conÔ¨Ådential information was said to have arisen conse-
quent to the law relating to property, agreement, conÔ¨Ådence, trust and
bailment. See further WR Cornish, Intellectual Property: Patents,

Newbery is one of the earliest cases dealing with equity jurisdiction and
decided on the basis of breach of contracts law. Cf. Williams v Williams
(1317) 3 Mer 157, 36 ER 61, 62 (Ch) where court afÔ¨Årmed the said ques-
tion relating to jurisdiction. However, this was not a settled, well-adapted
principle as seen in the verdict in Morison v Moat (1851) 9 Hare 241, 68
ER 492 (Ch) where the court‚Äôs jurisdiction was not in doubt, but rather
the source of this jurisdiction (whether derived from contract law, prop-
erty law or breach of trust law). All these cases/judgments show that
though there was conÔ¨Çict, it was treated just as any other contract law
dispute. It was only later that the problem was also viewed from the an-
gles of breach of trust and property related reliefs.
In Vickery v Welch, 36 Mass 523, 527 (1837) and Jarvis v Peck, 10 Paige
Ch 118, 125 (NY Ch 1843), the concept of restraint on further trade of
the employee for the purposes of protecting undisclosed information
seemed too far-fetched as they validated the non-compete clause; how-
ever, non-compete clause were upheld as they were the only recourse for
the employer as the information that the employee had gathered by vir-
tue of the employment could not be restricted by any other means.
See Peabody v Norfolk, 98 Mass 452 (1868) where the defendant employee
joined a competing trade to use information gathered from the plaintiff
and the plaintiff requested an injunction against the competing factory.
In response, the defendant had evoked precedence in his defence and op-
posed the concept of trade secret. Justice Gray‚Äôs policy was formulated in
response to the case.

owner will incur commercial loss / suffer a setback.
While it is not necessary that the owner demonstrate
signiÔ¨Åcant commercial advantage, the protection of
the information must result in improving the posi-
tion of the owner of the information in contrast to
the absence of protection. To determine this, the fol-
lowing factors are usually employed by courts:
 the value of the information to the owner and its
 the amount of effort and/or money invested in de-
 the level and amount of effort invested into keep-
 the level of difÔ¨Åculty faced by others when acquir-
 the accessibility of the information to the public,
including whether any portion of this informa-
tion is in the public domain or is made obtain-
application(s) or
able
marketing.
 Reasonable measures have been taken by the
owner to keep the information secret. The point to
be noted here is that the steps taken/effort invested
by the owner must be ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô in amount.17
The rationale for this is once again tied to the re-
quirement that the information is valuable to the
owner and he or she has a genuine interest in
keeping it protected. This scrutiny will depend on
the circumstances of the case,18 although, in gen-
eral, it may be sufÔ¨Åcient to show that positive steps
to secure the secret have been taken.

through prior patent

The above requirements appear to mandate the protec-
tion of trade secrets as a form of property. The follow-
ing discussion will discuss this from a theoretical
standpoint.

Trade secrets and property

The primary objective of this contribution is to deter-
mine whether trade secrets should be entitled to the
same treatment as other forms of real and personal
property. In this respect, no deÔ¨Ånite answer can be pro-
vided unless we refer to these two notions, in line with
what courts have also done.

Understanding property

The concept of property is more complex than it may
appear. In simple terms, property could mean the rights
that people enjoy over any object/thing.19 The classic
notion of property refers to a physical, tangible object,
not really something in the form of information. This
raises difÔ¨Åculties when property is not just conÔ¨Åned to
tangible forms, including determining whether and to
what extent intellectual property is actually a form of
property. Property, in its classical formulation, is a bun-
dle of rights over an object.20 In a sense, if something is
‚Äúproper‚Äù to me, it is my own property.21 Like all things
on this earth, property also has two notions: one actual
and the other legal.22 Then again, property is not just
about the thing owned, but about the relationship that
people (the owner, a third-party, etc) have with it.23
Bartolus (1313‚Äì1357) was the Ô¨Årst to deÔ¨Åne property as

See Pioneer Hi-Bred Int‚Äôl v Holden Found Seeds, 35 F 3d 1226, 1235 (8th
Cir 1994) (holding that protection need not be absolute but must be rea-
sonable). MAI Sys Corp v Peak Computer, 991 F 2d 511, 521 (9th Cir
1993) deÔ¨Ånes the term ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô as including the act of letting em-
ployees know of the existence of a trade secret, divulging it only on a
‚Äòneed to know basis‚Äô and making the employees sign a conÔ¨Ådentiality
agreement. See R Milgrim, Milgrim on Trade Secrets (PUBLISHER PlACE
YEAR) s 1.04, para 1-126, who adds the act of keeping the trade secret
locked. Rockwell Graphic Sys Inc v DEV Industries, Inc, 925 F 2d 174 (7th
Cir 1991) allows disclosure for limited purposes to licensees, etc. What is
reasonable also depends on a company‚Äôs own policies/rules, and a failure
to comply with internal rules would mean that reasonable steps were not
taken to keep the information secret, which can be a basis for denying
trade secret protection as held in CVD, Inc v Raytheon Co, 769 F 2d 842
(1st Cir 1985).
See Rockwell Graphic Systems, above, n 17, where the plaintiff, a printing
press manufacturer, had given the blueprints for its machine parts to a
limited number of vendors and to its own engineers. It alleged that the
defendant, a competitor, had misappropriated the drawings. In its judg-
ment, the Court of Appeal for the 7th Circuit explained that it would not
be reasonable to require that the manufacturer forbid any replication of
blueprints, thereby forcing all of the vendors and engineers to share a sin-
gle copy. The court famously noted that ‚Äòperfect security is not optimum
security‚Äô (PARA 27).

the right to fully dispose of a material good provided
that this was not prohibited by law.24 Though by ‚Äòmate-
rial good‚Äô he meant a good which we can see and touch;
it would not be a stretch to include trade secrets in this
category. While information may not be material, in
the sense that it is not a physical object, it is material in
the sense that the information is material to the owner.
This is because property is more about the rights at-
tached to it than it is about physical appearance or
sheer existence.

Theories on property

There are different theories on property, but for the
present discussion one of the most relevant is the Ô¨Årst-
possession theory of property.25 This theory stems from
a naturalist description which states that all resources
which constitute property in themselves or collectively
make up property, exist in nature and are available to
all. However, the Ô¨Årst person to take possession of any
of these resources becomes their Ô¨Årst and true owner,
to the exclusion of others. This theory justiÔ¨Åes property
through physical ownership of the object in question.
This theory has been criticized as advancing a notion of
property suffering from further complexities and con-
sidered in conÔ¨Çict with later theories, including labour-
related. As far as trade secrets are concerned, the Ô¨Årst-
possession theory does not appear to accommodate
them within the notion of property. In terms of infor-
mation creation, trade secrets cannot be claimed by
anyone under the logic of Ô¨Årst possession, as the Ô¨Årst
owner is also the creator of the trade secret. If the infor-
mation is not of the nature that needs to be created, if
it is readily available in the public domain, then it is
not a trade secret. Thus the whole mechanism of ac-
quiring property has no signiÔ¨Åcant role to play as far as
trade secrets are concerned. Information for the pur-
pose of trade secret is something that is developed over
time and not something that is merely acquired.

The Lockean labour theory of property26 undoubt-
edly is the theory that has afforded the broadest IP pro-
tection under the umbrella of property. Rather than
justify property based on mere Ô¨Årst-possession, it pos-
tulates a further act giving rise to property. Only if one
puts any kind of labour into an object existing in the

state of nature, can he or she become its rightful owner.
Mere acquisition does not justify an ownership claim.
This theory of unilateral appropriation demands that
others morally acknowledge such ownership and the
rights attached to it. Trade secrets may thus be accom-
modated within this understanding of property: infor-
mation, in the form of raw facts, exists in nature, and
as soon as a person invests efforts/labour into it, he or
she becomes its rightful owner. Locke went on to say
that the fruits of one‚Äôs labour are one‚Äôs own.27 He thus
supported exclusive ownership of property. Although
Locke‚Äôs views pertained mainly to land ownership, his
theory can be applied to the types of property under
discussion. In this sense, an employer will be the true
owner of his property by virtue of the fact that he has
developed the property (information) and that he his
trade has improved as a result. The employer may dis-
close this property to another (the employee) but only
in the course of his trade and with the objective of fur-
thering his trade. If the employee were to disclose it to
a third party,
to stealing the
property.

this would amount

Trade secret as propertys: the problems
Courts have recognized trade secrets as property and
provided the plaintiff with consequential reliefs for
some time. What appears problematic is not really clas-
sifying trade secrets as property, but rather determining
the logical consequences of such classiÔ¨Åcation. If trade
secrets are considered akin to any other tangible prop-
erty, then that would mean that a contract in restrain of
transfer (disclosure of the information) of such trade
secret property would not be unlawful.28 More gener-
ally, all the restraining clauses pertaining to trade se-
crets will be valid because it is upon the owner of the
property to choose what to do with it. By way of exem-
pliÔ¨Åcation, if a certain trade secret is seen as the prop-
erty of the employer who then passes it to the employee
for the purposes of the employment related activities,
this means that the employer is giving the employee the
right to use the property for certain speciÔ¨Åed purposes.
Since the employer is still the owner of the property,
the employee has limited power over it: he cannot dis-
pose of it, nor can he sell/mortgage/bail the property

Smriti Tripathi  Treating trade secrets as property

ARTICLE

without the consent of the employer. In a way, the em-
ployee has the possession of the property but does not
have any rights over it as the ownership lies with the
employer. Due to the intangible nature of the property
at hand, the implications of this are complex. More spe-
ciÔ¨Åcally, the following problems arise:

1.

2.

Information cannot be simply plucked from the em-
ployee‚Äôs mind. As a result, it can never be ‚Äòtaken
back‚Äô from him completely. The risk of the em-
ployee transmitting it to third parties is always
present.

Information can exist at multiple places at the same
time. It can have two or more masters. If the acts of
the employee are not restricted by a restraining clause,
there will be no difference between the employee‚Äôs
and the employer‚Äôs ownership of the property. This is
not true of physical property, which can be held by
one person at a time and even if it is held by multiple
owners, they cannot all have full ownership and en-
joyment of that property at the same time.

The issues outlined above strengthen the argument in
favour of restraining clauses for trade secret, as well as
indicate that trade secrets can never be absolutely equa-
ted with other forms of property as the classical rules
governing traditional forms of property fail to provide
an appropriate framework.

Nonetheless courts have afforded trade secret protec-
tion as a form of property. One could wonder how
this could be done without
frustrating the existing
principles pertaining to property.29 More speciÔ¨Åcally, one
of the major questions that emerge when treating trade
secrets as property is the following: if secret information
is property, why does the owner not have ‚Äòan exclusive
right to it as against the public‚Äô
like other property
owners?30

If we go back to the evolution of trade secrets law,
19th-century courts seem to have avoided the func-

tional aspects of property and focused instead on the
ideal concepts capable of
‚Äòproblem-solving‚Äô. In the
common law system, a person acquired the actual rights
over property by having ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô over that property,
exercised through either possession31 or ownership.
The question here again is how one can possess some-
thing intangible. And even if one could, how can it be
ensured that only one person possesses it at any point
in time? Since property here is information, any num-
ber of people can possess it without reducing the
others‚Äô share. If you learn that two plus two equals
four, then that will not decrease my knowledge of the
equation. In this case, how can I limit my ownership/
possession over such a piece of property? The only
plausible solution appears to keep it secret. Then again,
a piece of information (eg an idea) cannot be a secret at
the development stage as the idea might require others‚Äô
input to be fully developed.32

Conclusion

The analysis presented above has highlighted how trade
secrets can hardly be accommodated within the notion
of property. The intangible nature of
trade secrets
makes them highly distinctive from the classical notion
of property. Even if the deÔ¨Ånition of property is ex-
panded to Ô¨Åt trade secrets under its ambit, the fact re-
mains that a piece of information cannot be erased
from a defendant‚Äôs mind and can exist in more than
one place at a time without making any the information
holder any less of an owner and without sacriÔ¨Åcing
with the others‚Äô share. Trade secrets have been afforded
protection under the umbrella of property, but this has
mostly been the case for the purpose of validating rele-
vant restraining agreements, rather than because of a
natural Ô¨Åt within property doctrines.

See JC Stedman, ‚ÄòTrade Secrets‚Äô (1962) 23 Ohio Stat LJ 4, 26‚Äì27, who
notes that, historically, the courts have found it easier to afford trade se-
crets protection by viewing the restraint as a restraint on the sale of busi-
ness rather than on employment. Stedman highlights the fact that the
defendant is free to engage in any trade or occupation, as long as he does
not divulge any protected information to a third party, in particular to a
competing trade. The courts have adopted this view and carefully
avoided the contended nullity of the restraints by virtue of them being re-
straints on the trade of the defendant.
