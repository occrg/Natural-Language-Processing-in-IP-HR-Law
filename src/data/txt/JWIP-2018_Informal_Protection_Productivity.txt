The main objective of this paper is to investigate the direct
relationship between formal and informal protection meth-
ods and firms' productivity and financial performance. This
study used Chilean firms' level data. The principal findings
are that micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)
with informal protection methods positively influence
productivity and financial performance. Moreover, the
results show that formal and informal protection methods
are interconnected. Their joint effect accelerates firms'
productivity and makes financial performance stronger as
compared to using a single protection method. This outcome
is robust across SMEs and large firms. Thus, this finding
suggests that using a combination of formal and informal
protection method benefits firms' productivity and financial
performance. The managerial
implications of this study
suggest that business managers/owners could use multiple
protection methods (a mix of formal and informal) to
increase their
In
addition, to support innovation in Chilean firms, economic
policies must encourage innovation in small businesses
through subsidies (tax credits) and R&D grants, as well as

INTRODUCTION

Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are effective tools for protecting firms' innovation output from imitation. These IPRs
are also known as protection methods in the innovation literature. Protections methods not only generate additional
revenues for firms but also provide them with strategic competitive advantage (see, Spithoven, Vanhaverbeke, &
Roijakkers, 2013). This study focuses on firm's formal (requiring legal measures with registration costs) and informal
(based on trust and relationship and not requiring registration costs) protection methods and their association with
firm's productivity and financial performance. In order to protect innovation, firms use different combinations of
formal (patents, copyrights, and trademarks) and informal (secrecy and confidentiality agreements) methods (Hall,
Helmers, Rogers, & Sena, 2014). However, for a firm, the choice between formal and informal protection methods
depends on the innovation output. For instance, many firms prefer to use patents for product innovation and secrecy
for process innovation. Similarly, firms' adoption of formal and informal protection methods may also depend on the
degree of novelty of the innovation. A firm can use patents for a radical innovation (new to the world) and secrecy for
incremental type of innovations (new to the business) (see Hanel, 2008). However, both formal and informal methods
require costs: patents are usually expensive, and for secrecy or confidentiality agreements firms may require active
knowledge management in the form of internal secrecy policy (see Hall et al., 2014).

Regarding the benefits of protection methods, these methods (patents, trademark, copyrights, utility model,
secrecy etc.) reduce information asymmetry and it is easy for small firms to secure external credit backed by IPRs
(Rossenfosse, 2012); increase firms' revenue through monopoly power and could help domestic economy in securing
foreign direct investment (Yang, Huang, & Lin, 2014). Moreover, protection methods discourage imitation and
increase employees' loyalty through the reputational incentives (Thoma & Zimmermann, 2013). Further, Hagedoorn
and Zobel (2015) empirical study of 101 manufacturing firms concludes that firms with strong protection methods
(patents, copy rights, brands, and trade secrecy) are more likely to engage in open innovation activities with customers,
suppliers and competitors. Such protection methods not only protect knowledge but also encourage open firms to
exchange that knowledge with external partners in order to value their innovation output.

In short, the aim of this empirical study is to examine the direct relationship between protection methods (formal
and informal) and firms' productivity and financial performance. Based on Chilean micro level data, these formal
(patents, utility models, branding, and plant variety methods etc.) and informal
(secrecy and confidentiality
agreements) protection methods represent the importance of property rights to firms, as measured on a Likert scale.
This study is novel and contributes to the existing knowledge in several ways. First, previous studies (Jensen &
Webster, 2006; Passi & Valkokari, 2010; Thoma & Bizer, 2013) neglected to make a direct estimation of the relation
between protection methods (both formal and informal) and Chilean firms' performance. Second, past studies reveal a
research gap in terms of empirical analysis of the interrelation between formal and informal protection methods and
their joint effect on Chilean firms' performance. To measure the firms' performance, two proxies have been used; first,
productivity (total factor productivity) and second, financial performance (net profit margin). Profitability ratio is
crucial for firms' long term existence and it is regarded as a major source of small firms' capital when considering their
external constraint. Further, protection methods are connected to firms' output, that is, increasing their productivity
and thus profiting from their innovation. To analyze the impact of protection methods on firms' performance, the data
were split into four size categories, that is, micro, small, medium (MSMEs), and large enterprises. This strategy
investigates the link between protection methods and firms' performance more appropriately than taking a single size
of firm'. Overall, the research paper formulated the following research questions: Do formal and informal protection
methods affect firms' productivity and financial performance? and, How the interrelation between formal and
informal protection affect firms' productivity and financial performance?

Concerning the empirical approach, this paper uses a Tobit regression model (based on censored data) to analyze
the relationship between protection methods and firms' productivity and financial performance. The principal
outcome of the Tobit regression analysis suggests that informal protection methods positively affect SMEs'
productivity and financial performance more than they do more those of large firms. However, no association is found

between formal protection methods and MSMEs productivity and financial performance. Interestingly, use of
interactive variables of formal and informal protection methods further accelerates the productivity and financial
performance of SME and large firms. This outcome indicates that the joint effect of formal and informal protection
method on productivity and financial performance is stronger than that of a single protection method. This paper is
structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the literature and Section 3 presents the methodology and
research context of the paper. Section 4 discusses the obstacles to firms' innovation and Section 5 provides the
empirical results. Lastly, Section 6 concludes the study and presents policy implications.

2 | THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Several studies (Huggins & Weir, 2012; Jensen & Webster, 2006; Naqshbandi & Kaur, 2015; Spithoven et al., 2013)
stressed the importance of protection methods in determining small firms' innovation performance. Past studies
corroborate that innovation alone is not sufficient to maximize firms' profits, but that a simultaneous protection
mechanism is essential to monetize their innovations using formal and informal protection methods. Jensen and
Webster (2006) panel study of Australian manufacturing and services SMEs asserted that the use of formal protection
methods (patents, trademarks, and designs) is a key factor in SMEs innovation performance. Based on a panel study of
open innovation practices in 1427 Belgian SMEs, Spithoven et al. (2013) concluded that innovation performance of
SMEs is strongly driven by protection methods. In support of Spithoven et al. (2013), Eppinger and Vladova (2013) also
stressed the importance of protection methods (patents, trademarks, copyright, and secrecy) in three German
pharmaceutical SMEs to profit from their innovation output. Similarly, Naqshbandi and Kaur (2015) conducted a cross-
sectional survey of 339 High-Tech manufacturing firms (pharmaceutical, electronics, and aerospace) from Malaysia.
They found that formal (patent) and informal (secrecy) protection methods are effective innovation mechanisms for
Malaysian firms. Comparatively, Huggins and Weir (2012) paper on small knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS)
found that low innovation in small firms' leads to high cost of protection methods (e.g., cost of patent application and
renewal and the litigation cost). The aforementioned studies apparently indicate that protection methods (formal and
informal) encourage innovation in SMEs and thus accelerate productivity and profitability.

In contrast, a number of researchers (Boldrin & Levin, 2013; Frietsch, Neuhausler, & Rothengatter, 2013; Kitching
& Blackburn, 1998; Olander, Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, & Mohnen, 2009) argued that formal protection methods are
costly for SMEs due to their resource constraint. Previous studies (see Frietsch et al., 2013) provided two major
reasons for the low level of formal protection methods in SMEs. First, there is a lack of R&D expenditure in small firms
which results in low innovation output, and this discourages small firms from protecting their innovation output.
Second, the cost of patent application and renewal is high, and litigation and defending patents fees is often high
(Thoma & Zimmermann, 2013). Thus, when cost exceeds benefits, SMEs rely less on formal protection methods. On
the other hand, Passi and Valkokari (2010) study on 40 Finnish and Dutch public firms' argued that informal protection
methods (confidentiality contracts) are important to protect the loss of firms' tacit knowledge and convert it to explicit
knowledge. Similarly, empirical evidence is provided by Kitching and Blackburn (1998) regarding the use of informal
methods (customer-supplier relationship, trade secrets) in British SMEs. A study based on Italian manufacturing firms
by Bolisani, Paiola and Scarso (2013) found that small firms prefer to use informal methods to protect their innovation
output.

Concerning the link between protection methods and SMEs performance, numerous studies (e.g., Agostini,
Caviggioli, & Filippini, 2015; Agostini, Filippini, & Nosella, 2016; Fischer, Volckner, & Sattler, 2010; Paallysaho &
Kuusisto, 2011) analyzed the relationship between protection methods (both formal and informal) and SMEs
performance. Ghapar, Brooks, and Smuth (2014) found that patent activity in Malaysian SMEs significantly influenced
their net profit margin. Thoma and Zimmermann (2013) study on 1257 German SMEs found that protection methods
such as utility models (petty patents), trademarks, and retaining employees over the long term positively affected
(2010) argued that branding products increases the
SMEs innovation performance. Similarly, Fischer et al.

productivity of SMEs because brand-loyal customers are willing to pay a higher price. Another study by Paallysaho and
Kuusisto (2011) examined the formal and informal protection methods in small businesses in the UK and Finish service
sector. They showed that informal practices such as secrecy, restricted access to information, technical protection,
and staff rotation were more prevalent in the UK and Finnish small businesses compared to formal protection
methods (patents) and that these informal practices significantly improved their performance. In addition, Hanel
(2008) investigated the IPR methods in Canadian manufacturing firms. Based on a logit regression analysis, Hanel
found that the use of IPRs significantly improved firm's innovation and profitability performance. In sum, to the best of
this author's knowledge, there no empirical study has been conducted to examine the impact of protection methods
on Chilean firms' productivity and financial performance. Based on previous findings, this study has extracted four
hypotheses, as follows:

H1: Formal protection methods positively influence SMEs' productivity.
H2: Informal protection methods positively influence SMEs productivity.
H3: Formal protection methods have a positive impact on SMEs' financial performance.
H4: Informal protection methods have a positive impact on SMEs' financial performance.

2.1 | Interrelatedness of protection methods

SMEs use various types of protection methods. Paallysaho and Kuusisto (2011) stated that UK and Finnish SMEs
utilized formal (patents) and informal (secrecy) protection methods to accelerate business performance. Spithoven
et al. (2013) study of Belgium SMEs suggested that SMEs use of diverse protection methods significantly improves
their innovative product sales. While Hall et al. (2014) qualitative study implied that the choice of protection method
(formal or informal) depends on the innovation output. According to Hall et al. (2014), secrecy is effective for process
innovation and patents are useful for product innovation. Similarly, Olander, Vanhala, and Hurmelinna-Laukkanen
(2014) pointed out the interconnectedness between formal (patents, copyrights, and trademarks) and informal
(secrecy and employees contracts) protection methods analyzing 209 Finnish firms'. They argued that the choice of
formal and informal protection mechanism depend on the firms' invention. For instance, a firm' with an original idea
(technological innovation) can protect it from imitation by legal means, that is, using a patent, copyright or trademark,
while protecting the tacit knowledge embodied in employee' does not require costly protection methods. For
example, using HR practices (informal) such as reducing employees' turnover, increasing staff commitment and
providing training could protect knowledge flows between firms. Moreover, Graham and Somaya (2006) investigated
the interrelationship between protection methods in US software firms. Using seemingly unrelated regression, they
found that complementary link exist between copyrights and trademarks from common inputs of organizational
resources (managerial attentiveness to protection methods). To conclude, previous studies indicate that firm use
simultaneously diverse protection methods to protect their inventions. However, these studies failed to address the
interconnectedness between formal and information protection methods and their joint effect on the Chilean firms'
productivity and financial performance. To examine the statistical
link of interrelatedness between these two
protection methods and firms' performance, an additional hypothesis is developed, as follows:

H5: The interrelatedness of formal and informal protection methods positively influence firms' productivity
and financial performance.

3 | DATA SOURCE

Chilean firm level data was accessed from the Ministerio de Economia de Chile and were initially gathered by the
National Institute of Statistics (INE) in 2015. Regarding the number of observations, 4057 firms responded to the

274 |

REHMAN

survey. However, only 2,304 (56.7% of the total) provided financial information (sales). Further, the sample size
dropped to 1,568 (39%) due to missing information on variables such as capital and materials. The postal survey was
mainly targeted at registered firms (tax payers). The data provided information on key variables such as R&D,
protection methods (IPRs), financial performance (sales and assets) and obstacles to innovation. In addition, the survey
covered 15 regions of Chile including the capital Santiago (67.37%), as well as Valparaiso (6.29%), Del Biobio (5.20%),
Los Lagos (2.59%), La Araucania (2.59%), Antofagasta (2.34%) and so forth. Table 1 presents information on the survey
data which covered the different sectors of the economy. Predominantly, the data were collected from firms in
defence and social security (33.3%), manufacturing (almost 15%) and so forth (see Table 1 for details). This paper has
included firms from all sectors of the economy for two reasons: First, this strategy can generalize the results for all
sectors; second, splitting the data in terms of manufacturing or services sector reduces the sample size significantly,
resulting in insignificant estimates.

In addition, Table 2 presents information on the firms' size categories. In Chile, firms' sales are used as proxy to
define micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), based on the Unidad de Fominto (UF) valuation. Through this
method, the exchange rate between the Chilean peso (the national currency of Chile) and the UF is constantly
adjusted for inflation so that the UF value remains unchanged on a daily basis. In the survey, the initial financial
information was provided in Chilean pesos. However, to deflate the financial information, the Chilean peso is
converted into UF valuation. According to the official Chilean definition of MSMEs, of the total sample 2,304 (the
remaining firms did not provide financial information), 244 firms are micro enterprises and 427 and 415 were classified
as small and medium-sized enterprises respectively in the sample, while in the total sample, larger-sized firms are
predominant (n = 1218).

3.1 | An overview of intellectual property rights in Chile

Chile is a strong, middle-income country in South America in terms of GDP per capita (nearly US$ 15000), with low
inflation and unemployment rates. Chile exports mainly copper, wine, and salmon-related products to the rest part of
the world. Chile spends 0.4% of GDP on research and development (R&D) and has a low level of usage of IPRs. This
indicates that the Chilean economy has a low investment in knowledge-based resources (low R&D and human capital

and poor university-industry linkages). Interestingly, the Chilean economy is mainly comprised of small and medium-
sized enterprises (99%) and 60% of the total workforce is employed in the small business sector. However, Chilean
SMEs have high unit costs of R&D (or patents), face difficulty in securing external finance and have low purchasing
power in the domestic market (see, Benavente & Goya, 2012). Concerning the innovative support programs in Chile,
two institutions, FONTEC (National Productivity and Technological Development Fund) and FONDEF (Science and
Technology Development Fund), provide R&D subsidies, training and development to SMEs' entrepreneurs. To
protect firms' innovation output, Chile has signed various treaties, for example, TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-related
aspects of Intellectual Property Rights); CUP (Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property); UPOV
(International Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties) and so forth. Specifically, FONTEC rules consist of a
clause which states that firms with patent results can reimburse the public funds of a FONTEC funded-research
project. Further, FONDEF encourages IPR agreements between firms and research organizations.

industrial

Benavente and Goya (2012) stated that despite the efficient legal system in Chile, Chilean firms' use of IPRs is low.
They argued that the size of the Chilean domestic market and the purchasing power is exogenous to IPRs, resulting in a
high unit cost of patents. Nevertheless, Chilean enterprises use several protection methods to protect their innovation
outputs such as patents, utility models, copyrights, trademark, trade secrecy,
law, confidentiality
agreements, and plant variety protection methods. These protection methods (formal and informal) protect product
innovations in the manufacturing, services and agriculture sector. However, the cost of each protection method is
different and patents/utility models are relatively expensive. It is estimated that it costs nearly US$ 1500 to file a
patent (including examination fee) and over and above that, the cost of litigation (when infringement take place) is high
for Chilean MSMEs. Moreover, small Chilean innovative enterprises face several barriers to protecting their
innovations. For example, small business entrepreneurs perceive that high learning and legal cost of applying for
patents and inefficiency in the legal system are the major obstacles (see De León & Fernandez Donoso, 2016). De León
and Donoso's (2016) case study on small businesses from Latin America revealed that in many South American
countries including Chile, lack of awareness and knowledge and the cognitive bias related to the IP system reduce the
business performance. Overall, this study seeks to investigate the impact of protection methods (formal and informal)
on firm's productivity and financial performance.

3.2 | Importance of protection methods for firms

In order to measure the importance of protection methods for firms, initially firms were ask to respond to a list of
protection methods on a scale of 1 = high importance; 2 = medium importance; 3 = low importance; 4 = no
importance. These rank statements were based on nine protection methods: i) brand name; ii) patent; iii) utility model
(petty patents); iv) industrial law; v) copyright; vi) plant variety methods (related to new breeding of a plant); vii)
business secrecy; viii) methods of confidentiality clauses for employees; and ix) method of confidentiality contracts for
suppliers and/or customers. Table 3 shows information related to the protection methods in terms of their
importance. Overall, Chilean firms have a low tendency to adopt protection methods. Of the total of 4,057, only

13.29% and 11.95% firms opted for brand and patent methods, respectively, as being highly important in protecting
their innovations. However, majority of the firms have low (<10%) tendency to utilize protection methods.
Interestingly, the last three methods, business secrecy, employees' confidentiality contracts, and confidentiality
contracts for suppliers and/or customers, had a high response rate as compared to other protection methods (see
Table 3). This indicates that Chilean firms are more at ease while using these protection methods.

4 | OBSTACLES TO FIRMS' INNOVATION

A number of studies (e.g., Abor & Biekpe, 2007) have argued that SMEs are more financially constrained as compared to
large firms. The lack of financial resources for SMEs results in low investment in R&D projects. Not surprisingly, R&D is a
key input to a firm's innovation output. For example, the panel study of Artz, Norman, Hatfield, and Cardinal (2010) on US
firms' found that firms undertaking R&D were more likely to introduce patents. However, due to a lack of financial
resources, SMEs can receive R&D support programs such as R&D subsidies, R&D grants or tax credit to accelerate their
firm's performance (see, Hottenrott & Lopes-Bento, 2012). Further, Benavente and Goya (2012) conducted a micro-
level qualitative study on Chilean firms' and found that the high unit cost of R&D, no tax incentives and the lack of R&D
support programs are the major obstacles to Chilean SMEs. According to the statistics of Chile 9th Innovation Business
Survey which was conducted in 2014, only 6.41% of Chilean SMEs introduced product innovation and majority of these
firms (74.38%) generated an incremental type of innovation (new to the business). Regarding process innovation, nearly
23% of 5,620 firms introduced process innovations. Moreover, only 6% of firms were engaged in internal R&D and
approximately 3% of firms (N = 5,620) were engaged in external R&D. The statistics concerning low innovation activities
in Chilean firms suggest that small firms would prefer to use informal protection methods (business secrecy and
confidentiality agreements) to avoid the high cost of formal protection methods. Overall, these finding from the
innovation survey shows that Chilean SMEs face constraints in terms of investment in innovation activities. In sum, this
study included four additional dummy variables (codified 1 if firm reported yes to the obstacle or otherwise 0) such as the
lack of qualified staff, lack of financial resources, no or inadequate tax incentives and the lack of R&D support programs.
These dummy variables would investigate the impact of innovation obstacles on the firm's productivity and financial
performance and could help in policy implications concerning protection methods implementation.

Figure 1 shows the innovation obstacles by firm size. In the figure, it can be seen that firms have reported the lack
of qualified staff as their least important obstacle. However, the lack of financial resources (over 25%) is higher for
micro and small enterprises than medium or large firms. Similarly, SMEs have fewer tax incentives as compared to

REHMAN

| 277

FIGURE 1 Obstacles by firms' size (in percent)

large firms. On the other hand, the majority of the firms reported the lack of R&D support as their major obstacle to
innovation activities (see Figure 1). Overall, no or fewer tax incentives and the lack of R&D support programs are the
major barriers for firms in all size categories. This study introduced an additional hypothesis to investigate the impact
of obstacles on firms' productivity and financial performance. This hypothesis can provide a deeper understanding of
obstacles to Chileans firms' performance.

H6: Obstacles negatively affect the firms' productivity and financial performance.

5 | EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

The firm's importance towards protection methods were initially measured on ordinal scale (i.e., 1 = High importance to
4 = No importance). This indicates that data on protection methods have violated the parametric assumption (non-
normally distributed data). Therefore, Spearman's rank correlation method, a non-parametric method, is an appropriate
technique to examine the correlation between protection methods (Field, 2005, p. 129). Table 4 reports the correlation
coefficients of protection methods. These positive correlation coefficients are statistically significant at 5%. This implies
that firms' protection methods positively influence each other in terms of protecting their innovation outputs. In other
words, firms may use different combinations of protection methods. This outcome also suggest that using such firms'
perceived protection methods directly in the regression analysis would result in a severe multi-collinearity problem. In
order to remove this multi-collinearity problem, principal component factor analysis (PCFA) is used (see, Table 5). PCFA
minimizes the variable numbers and provide the structural link between these variables. Factors are derived from the
Kaiser Criterion (see Kaiser, 1960), which indicates that those factors should be obtained with an Eigen value equal or
greater than one. To remove the collinearity between variables, variance maximizing orthogonal method is used.

Table 5 presents information on the factor analysis of protection methods. Overall, two factor are extracted: factor 1 is
linked with formal protection methods and factor 2 is connected with informal protection methods. In columns 2 and 3, high
factor loadings (bold italic values) are provided, showing the correlation between a variable and the factor. To interpret,
brand protection with a factor loading of 0.5717 shows that nearly 57% of brand is positively correlated to a formal
protection method. The remaining protection methods such as patent, utility model, industrial law and copyrights are
positively correlated to formal protection methods. The last three protection methods, that is, business secrecy and
confidentiality agreements, are positively correlated to informal protection methods. The factor loading for informal
protection methods is found to be higher than formal protection methods. In addition, the column labelled “uniqueness”
quantifies the variance of each variable that is not shared with other variables in the factor models. A variable with high

two tests have been carried out. First, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test, the value of which is 0.90 and second, the scale
reliability coefficient, which is 0.91, suggesting that the use of the factor model is highly satisfactory.

5.1 | Regression strategy

In order to estimate the prior expectations, this study split the productivity (see Appendix 1.a) and financial
performance (see Appendix 1.b) data into micro, small, medium, and large size categories. To obtain estimate for each
firms' size category, productivity and net profit margin are multiplied by the firms' size categories (e.g., TFP × micro,
NPM × micro, TFP × small, NPM × small and so forth). This strategy results in limiting the dependent variable values to
zero. In other words, a substantial number of observations take the value of zero. Having censored data, the use of
least squares would result in biased and inconsistent parameters. Since the dependent variable is censored, the Tobit
regression model is an appropriate regression strategy. This estimation procedure uses the maximum likelihood
procedure based on two sorts of a data, that is, the limit observations (y = 0) and the non-limit observations (y > 0) in
the dependent variable (Hill, Griffiths, & Lim, 2007).

The equation for Tobit model is

¼ Xiα þ εi

y*
i

 

where εi ∼ N 0; σ2



y*
i is a latent variable and censored. The model assumes that errors are normally distributed. The observed value of y is
defined by the following equation;

(
yi ¼ y*

if y* > 0
0 if y* ≤ 0

In the Tobit model, it is assumed that the data are censored at 0. Similarly, the firms' formal and informal
protection methods are also multiplied by firms' size categories. This empirical approach investigates their statistical
link more appropriately.

5.2 | Regression results

REHMAN

Table 6 reports the findings of the Tobit regression analysis of the relationship between protection methods and firms'
productivity performance.1 In the first column of Table 6, explanatory variables are presented. The coefficient of the
formal protection method is 0.026 which is positively signed and shows that with a 1% increase in the formal
protection methods (e.g., brand, patent, utility model, etc.), the productivity of micro-sized firms' rises by 2.6%.
However, no statistical association is found between the formal protection method and the productivity of micro-
sized firms. In comparison, informal protection methods (e.g., business secrecy and confidentiality agreements) with
positively signed parameter (i.e., β = 0.240) shows that a 1% rise in the informal protection methods would be likely to
increase the productivity of micro-sized firms' by 24%. Further, informal protection methods present a statistical link
(significance at 5%) with micro-sized firms' productivity.

In addition, the estimate value of formal protection method becomes negative (β = −0.013) and shows no
statistical relationship with small size firms' productivity. However, the parameter of informal protection methods
presents a statistical association with small firms' productivity. Similarly, the estimated value of informal methods
provides positive association with the medium-sized firms' productivity. Overall, the regression analysis identified that
the coefficients of informal protection methods for MSMEs are strong and present statistical association with
productivity. Interestingly, both formal and informal protection methods in larger firms' show positive association with
the productivity of large-sized firms' (see Table 6). Overall, the outcome between protection methods (formal and
informal) and productivity across firms' size categories supports the initial expectations (H2). Protection methods
positively influence the firms' productivity. However, this relationship is found to be stronger for larger firms than for

those in any other size category. In sum, this finding supports the empirical findings of Paallysaho and Kuusisto (2011),
Spithoven et al. (2013), and Fischer et al. (2010).

The link between informal protection methods and MSMEs productivity suggest two possibilities. First, Chilean
MSMEs have a low tendency to use formal protection methods due to their lack of awareness of these methods.
Second, the high cost of formal protection methods (e.g., patents application/renewal or litigation), low innovation
output and the uncertainty related to patenting discourages small firms from undertaking formal protection methods.
Another reason is small firms have less bargaining power in negotiating formal protection methods with competitors
and in particular when the patent is declared invalid, it is a major risk for MSMEs (see Pajak, 2015). On the other hand,
large firms prefer to use both formal and informal protection methods to accelerate their productivity performance.
This implies that large firms have a resource advantage over small firms. Regarding obstacles to innovation, the lack of
financial resources and no or inadequate tax incentives negatively affect the productivity of SMEs. This result
suggests that Chilean SMEs are financially constrained. This outcome confirmed our prior expectation (H6). Firm age is
used as control variable and most of the firms are young (the average age is 3 years). The estimate of age is negatively
associated with micro-sized firms' productivity and this may indicate that younger firms have lower productivity than
older firms because of their inexperience in technology and innovation.

Table 7 provides information on the relationship between protection methods (formal and informal) and firms'
financial performance. The parameters of formal protection methods show no association with the MSMEs' financial
performance. However, the coefficient (β = 0.240) of informal protection method indicates that a 1% rise in informal

protection methods (secrecy and confidentiality agreements) would be likely to increase the financial performance of
micro-sized firms by 34%. Similarly, the estimated values of informal protection methods become stronger for SMEs
and present positive association with financial performance. Overall, the results are in line with the previous findings
in the Table 6 and supported the prior expectations. To conclude, Chilean MSMEs are more likely to utilize informal
protection methods to accelerate their financial performance.

The parameter value of the lack of financial resources shows a negative association with firms' financial
performance. Specifically, no (or inadequate) tax incentives has a negative impact on the SMEs' financial performance.
In sum, obstacles such as the lack of financial resources and no tax incentives negatively affect the firm's productivity
and financial performance. The coefficients of age show a negative relationship with micro and small firms' financial
performance. This suggests that younger firms are less likely to experience high profitability as compared to older and
large firms.

5.3 | Estimation—interrelatedness of protection methods (H5)

To analyze the interrelation between formal and informal protection methods, interactive variables were introduced.
Their joint and positive effects suggest their complementary relationship. In Table 8, the coefficient of interactive
variables of protection methods for micro sized firms is negatively signed but fails to show the statistical link with
productivity. The remaining parameters of interactive variables for SMEs and large firms present a positive and
significant association with productivity. This outcome has confirmed the prior expectation (H5).

Further, Table 9 provides information on the interactive variables (formal × informal) of protection methods and
firms' profitability. The estimates of interactive variables are positively signed and show a statistical association with
profitability. Overall, the coefficients of these interactive variables indicate that formal and informal protection
methods complement each other. This outcome suggests that firms' using one mechanism of protection would
increase the probability of value of the other. Use of interactive variables of protection methods has stronger

of formal and informal protection methods strongly influences the Chilean firms' productivity and financial
performance.

6 | CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

This empirical study answered the research questions regarding the link between protection methods and firms'
performance. The Tobit regression analysis results revealed that informal protection methods positively influence
MSMEs productivity and financial performance. Furthermore, the principal outcome of this study indicates that firms'
using multiple protection methods (a combination of formal and informal methods) experience higher productivity and
financial performance than do those using single protection mechanism. This outcome is also robust across SMEs and
large firms.

These findings support two managerial implications: first, if SMEs owners face financial constraint (low R&D
investment) then informal protection methods are relatively cheaper, as they require no registration or litigation cost,
specifically when infringement takes place. Specifically, small firms can keep secret information related to
manufacturing process, marketing and distribution strategies etc. without patenting them because small firms deem
such secret information to be their primary knowledge resource and are reluctant to share it with competitors.
Similarly, confidentiality contracts of small firms with customers and suppliers may accelerate their financial
performance through collaborations despite their lack of resources (see Brito, Brito, & Hashiba, 2014). This
collaborative strategy would provide SMEs with access to complementary resources. Second, the interconnectedness
between formal and informal protection methods further increases firms' productivity and financial performance.
Business managers could patent their innovation output and at the same time, firms' may protect key knowledge
through confidentiality agreements (e.g., signing agreement with key employees who are most closely engaged in the
process of developing the innovation). Such confidentiality contracts would protect information leakage for a limited

time. Thus, firms could experience high productivity and profitability while using a combination of protection
mechanisms. Concerning public policies, this empirical study identified that Chilean firms' have a low tendency to use
protection methods, mainly due to low innovation output. Therefore, government policies at micro level should
subsidize R&D projects (tax credits) to support innovation culture in small businesses and then create awareness in
small firms relating to the use of protection methods.

This study has used Cobb–Douglas production (with OLS) method for measuring the productivity due to the non-
availability of longitudinal data. Future studies could use Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) productivity estimation
procedure which addresses the endogeneity between factor inputs. Moreover, the reverse causality between
protection methods could also be resolved using the instrumental variables approach. Currently, the dataset has failed
to provide exogenous instruments. Further, in future, firms' direct measures of protection methods such as number of
patent counts, utility models, trademarks etc. could examine their link with firms' productivity and financial
performance more accurately.

APPENDIX A

Total Factor Productivity

To measure the firms' productivity, total factor productivity (TFP) is used. First, TFP is measured through Cobb–

Douglas production function. The mathematical expression for Cobb–Douglas production equation is;

y ¼ f l; k; m
Þ

ð

ð1Þ

Y represents firms' gross output (sales) which is the function of labor, capital, and materials. To deflate the
financial information (initially the data were given in Chilean pesos), sales, capital and materials are converted
into UF (Unidad de Fomento). One unit of UF equals 23,957.82 Chilean pesos (CLP), which is taken as average
value in the year 2015. The following accounts of sales, capital, and material are deflated by using formulas as
follows:

Sales ¼ðSalesiÞ=23; 957:82

Capital ¼ Σn

ð

i¼1 land; building; office equipment

Þ=23; 957:82

Materials ¼Σn

ð

i¼1 office supplies; laboratories equipment; chemicals

Þ=23; 957:82

Thus the final values are obtained in UF. Regarding the measurement of TFP, this study used the empirical
approach of Harris (2005); Harris and Li (2008). To obtain the total factor productivity (TFP), first augmented
production is estimated as follows:

yi ¼ γ0 þ γ1li þ γ2ki þ γ3mi þ ϵi

ð2Þ

Equation (2) measures the TFP (in logarithmic forms). These determinants (labor, capital, and materials) are

included directly in the model. Consequently, TFP is defined as (removing the subscripts):

REHMAN

lnTFP^≡y   γ^

1l   γ^

2k   γ^

3m

| 287

ð3Þ

However, measuring TFP based on equation (3) would result in (i) biased estimates by omitting variable from
equation (2) that determines output and (ii) provide inefficient estimates (potentially inconsistent standard errors and t
values). Thus, the preferred approach is to directly include these factors of output (TFP) into equation (2). This
estimation method avoids the problem of inefficiency and omitted variable bias. In sum, TFP is defined as any change
in output not due to changes in the input factors.

Net Profit Margin
The net profit margin (NPM) is used to measure the firms' financial performance. This study has used profitability

ratio (NPM) which shows the efficiency of the business in terms of profitability. The formula is;

Net Profit Margin ¼ Net Income=Sales

The net income account represents the sales minus all other expenses of the business such as salaries of R&D and
technical support staff members, leasing expenses, consultancy fees payment, security, intellectual property rights
and transportation costs, etc. Then 22% corporate tax is applied on sales to obtain the net income. Finally, the figures
were converted into UF units of account to obtain deflated values.
