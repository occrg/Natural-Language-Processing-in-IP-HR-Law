New Zealand: Wai 262 report and after
Barbara Sullivan and Lynell Tuffery-Huria*

The Waitangi Tribunal’s report on the Wai 262 claim was
released on 2 July 2011.1

The Wai 262 claim addressed the ownership and use
of Maori traditional knowledge, cultural expressions and
indigenous species of ﬂora and fauna, all of which are
known as taonga (treasures), and of inventions and pro-
ducts derived from indigenous ﬂora and fauna and/or
utilizing Maori knowledge.

In the report—Ko Aotearoa Te¯nei (‘This is New
Zealand’)2—the tribunal found that the government had
failed to comply with its obligations under the Treaty of
Waitangi to ensure that guardian relationships between
Maori and their taonga were acknowledged and pro-
tected. The tribunal recommended that future laws, pol-
icies and practices do acknowledge and respect those
relationships.

The report has implications for owners of all intellec-
tual property rights, and is particularly relevant for
those who may wish to register and use trade marks
which include Maori words or symbols, or obtain
patents for inventions or plant variety rights which rely
on Maori traditional knowledge or involve indigenous
ﬂora and/or fauna.

In this article we will describe those recommendations
that relate to intellectual property, and review some of
the other developments in the area of indigenous intel-
lectual property rights in New Zealand.

Background
The tangata whenua (people of the land, indigenous
people) of Aotearoa/New Zealand are the Maori. New
Zealand was settled by treaty. The Treaty of Waitangi was
signed in 1840 by certain Maori chiefs and a representa-
tive of the then British Monarch, Queen Victoria. The
Treaty of Waitangi has been described as New Zealand’s
founding document.

There has been much controversy surrounding the in-
terpretation of the Treaty (it was written in both English

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2014, Vol. 9, No. 5

The Waitangi Tribunal was established by the Treaty
of Waitangi Act 1975.4 A copy of the Treaty is annexed as
Schedule 1 to that Act. The tribunal considers claims by
Maori who consider themselves to be, or to be likely to
be, prejudicially affected by legislation, government
policy, practice, or any act or omission of the govern-
ment, which is ‘inconsistent with the principles of the
Treaty’.5 If the tribunal ﬁnds a claim to be well-founded
it can recommend that the government take action
to compensate for or to remove the prejudice. The
tribunal’s recommendations are not binding on the
government.

Key concepts
The Wai 262 claim considered certain key concepts
which are fundamental to Maori culture. These include:
† ma¯tauranga Maori—Maori knowledge, the unique
Maori way of viewing themselves and the world. It
encompasses both what is known and how it is
known and incorporates language, genealogy technol-
ogy, systems of law and social control, systems of
property and value exchange and forms of expression,
amongst other things.
† whanaungatanga—kinship, the relationship between
Maori and all things animate and inanimate in their
world, including people (living and deceased), gods,
plants, animals, mountains and rivers.
† kaitiakitanga—the obligation, arriving from the kin
relationship, to nurture and care for a person or
thing.
† kaitiaki—a guardian: a person who has the kaitiaki-
† taonga—anything that is treasured, including tangible
things (such as land, waters, plants, wildlife and cul-
tural works) and intangible things (such as language,
identity and culture, and ma¯tauranga Maori itself).

† taonga works—works
that are an expression of
ma¯tauranga Maori that invoke ancestral connections.
† taonga-derived works—works that derive their inspir-
ation from ma¯tauranga Maori, but do not have ances-
tral connections.

tanga obligation.

The claim
Commonly known as the indigenous ﬂora and fauna
and cultural and intellectual property claim, the Wai 262

claim raised concerns about the place of Maori culture,
identity and traditional knowledge in New Zealand’s
laws, and in its government policies and practices.

The claimants argued the government has an obliga-
tion to protect and that it did not protect:
† taonga works, taonga-derived works and ma¯tauranga
Maori from misuse and misappropriation (including
the acquisition of private rights by those who are not
kaitiaki);
† taonga works or the kaitiaki relationship between

Maori and taonga works.

In addition, it was claimed that the government agreed
to various international agreements and obligations and
developed policy and practices, all of which affected or
overrode Maori relationships with ma¯tauranga Maori,
taonga works and taonga-derived works.

The claimants sought authority over ma¯tauranga
Maori, taonga (including indigenous ﬂora and fauna),
taonga works and taonga-derived works.

The report
The tribunal considered the role of more than twenty
government departments, and the report contains chap-
ters on taonga works and intellectual property, genetic
and biological resources of taonga species, the environ-
ment, conservation, Te Reo Maori (the Maori language),
Crown control of ma¯tauranga Maori, rongoa¯ Maori
(traditional Maori healing) and the making of inter-
national instruments.

The tribunal said that the Wai 262 claim must be seen
in the context of the partnership established by the
Treaty of Waitangi. The tribunal noted that the tradition
in European society is to attribute value by granting
property rights, whereas Maori society deﬁnes value in
terms of kinship and obligations to the collective. The
tribunal observed:

[T]he guiding principles of kaitiakitanga on the one hand
and property rights on the other are really different ways of
thinking about the same issue—that is, the ways in which
two cultures decide the rights and obligations of communi-
ties in their created works and valued resources.6

Noting that ‘IP rights are never absolute’, the tribunal
acknowledged the need for a transparent and principled
mechanism to balance the interests of Maori with those
of other participants in New Zealand’s commercial and
cultural life. Regarding this balance, the tribunal said:

ARTICLE

[T]he balance should generally be struck in favour of pro-
tecting the cultural integrity of matauranga Maori, taonga
works, and the Maori elements of taonga-derived works.7

Recommendations
Trade marks and designs
The Trade Marks Act 20028 established the requirement
that the Commissioner of Trade Marks must appoint an
‘advisory committee’9 (commonly referred to as the
‘Maori Trade Mark Advisory Committee’) to advise the
commissioner on whether ‘the proposed use or registra-
tion of a trade mark that is, or appears to be, derivative
of a Maori sign, including text and imagery, is, or is
likely to be, offensive to Maori’10.

Members must have some knowledge of Maori proto-
col and culture (tikanga Maori) and the Maori world
view (te ao Maori).11

The Maori Trade Mark Advisory Committee con-
tinues to consider whether the use or registration of
trade marks incorporating Maori words and imagery
would be offensive to Maori. In the past three years, the
Maori Trade Mark Advisory Committee has considered
over 200 trade marks, and has advised the commissioner
that the use of only 15 trade marks would be offensive.

There have been calls for a committee with a broader
mandate, because the commissioner is not obliged to
follow the advisory committee’s advice; the committee
does not consider uses of trade marks for which applica-
tions have not been ﬁled; and the committee does not
consider non-trade mark uses of signs.

The tribunal made the following recommendations:12
(i) The Maori Trade Mark Advisory Committee
should be disbanded and replaced by a new, expert
commission with wider powers;

(ii) The proposed commission would have three func-
tions: adjudicative, facilitative and administrative;

(iii) The commission should be empowered to con-
sider all applications to register trade marks and
designs that include Maori elements, and consider
whether their use would be derogatory or offen-
sive to Maori;

(iv) In its adjudicative capacity,

the commission
should also hear objections about derogatory or
offensive uses of Maori elements (which could
include elements and uses that fall outside realm

of trade mark law, such as decorative use) and
make binding decisions;

(v) The commission’s main facilitative function would
involve the establishment of best practice guidelines
for the use, care, protection and custody of mataur-
anga Maori,
taonga works and taonga-derived
works;

(vi) The commission’s administrative functions would
include the establishment and maintenance of a
register of kaitiaki in respect to taonga works and
taonga-derived works. The register would be
aimed primarily at works that have come into the
public domain. (The tribunal recognized that
some matauranga Maori and taonga works are
‘essentially secret’.);

(vii) The commission’s decisions would be binding on

the Commissioners of Trade Marks and Designs;

(viii) All existing intellectual property rights of the
current rightsholders would be unaffected—with
one exception: the derogatory or offensive use of
taonga works and taonga-derived works, either
existing or in the future, should be prevented. The
commission would determine whether uses are
derogatory or offensive or not;

(ix) The future commercial uses of certain taonga
works and taonga-derived works or knowledge,
for which a kaitiaki can be identiﬁed, should be
the subject of consultation with, and in some cir-
cumstances require the consent of, the relevant
kaitiaki;

(x) Private and public, non-commercial use of taonga
works and taonga-derived works will not be
affected, unless the use is derogatory or offensive.

The tribunal proposed that there be such a commission
to protect, and give effect to, the kaitiaki relationship
with taonga works and their associated ma¯tauranga
Maori. The tribunal said the language of the Treaty of
Waitangi requires that kaitiaki ‘must have enough author-
ity and control over their taonga works to enable them to
meet the obligations and enjoy the beneﬁts of the
[kaitiaki] relationship’.13

The tribunal said the commission would need to be
multi-disciplinary and should have expertise, ‘at com-
mission level’ and ‘within the secretariat’ in ma¯tauranga
Maori, intellectual property law, commerce, science and
stewardship of taonga works and documents. The tribu-

nal noted that ‘size, structure, and budget will be for
ministers and ofﬁcials to work through’.14

Patents
The tribunal made the following recommendations with
respect to the New Zealand patent law regime:15

(i) An advisory committee should be formed to
advise the Commissioner of Patents on Maori
interests in proposed patents;

(ii) The proposed committee should advise the com-
missioner on issues relating to novelty, inventive
step and/or utility in relation to ma¯tauranga
Maori;

(iii) The committee would also advise the commis-
sioner where kaitiaki interests are at risk. The
report suggested that where a patent is contrary to
kaitiakitanga (the guardianship interest), it could,
subject
to balancing with other interests, be
refused on the grounds that it is contrary to ordre
public (public order)—a ground which is permit-
ted under
the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (‘TRIPS
Agreement’);16

(iv) The commissioner should be required to take
formal advice from the committee when consider-
ing an application that raises Maori issues;

(v) The committee should not only function at the
commissioner’s request—but should be allowed to
investigate, of its own volition, any patent applica-
tion, or any patent ﬁled or granted in New Zealand;

(vi) Kaitiaki would be able to register their interests in
particular species in order to give patent owners
fair warning of an interest. However, an interest
would not need to be registered to be taken into
account by the committee;

(vii) Patent applicants should be required to disclose
whether an application relies on Maori traditional
knowledge. This requirement would be manda-
tory, although the exact sanctions for failure to
disclose are not mentioned in the report.

The Patents Act 201317 requires the commissioner to
appoint a ‘Maori advisory committee’.18 The commit-

tee’s functions are to advise the commissioner, at the
request of the commissioner, on whether a claimed in-
vention is derived from Maori traditional knowledge or
from indigenous plants or animals, and if so, whether
the commercial exploitation of that invention is likely to
be contrary to Maori values.19

While this amendment does introduce a Maori advis-
ory committee, the role of this committee is restricted to
a consideration of whether an invention is derived from
Maori traditional knowledge or from indigenous plants
or animals. The committee is not required to advise on
novelty, inventive step or utility issues.

The Maori advisory committee is authorized to
provide advice only at the request of the commissioner,
and while the commissioner must consider the advice
given by the committee, the commissioner is not bound
by that advice.20 (The tribunal’s recommendation was
that the committee’s formal advice be binding on the
commissioner.21)

The tribunal’s recommendation that patent applicants
should be required to disclose whether an application
relies on Maori traditional knowledge may yet be imple-
mented. The regulations concomitant to the Patents Act
2013 have not been published at the time of writing.
Section 39 of the Act outlines the required contents of a
complete speciﬁcation. Section 39(1)(d) states that every
complete speciﬁcation must ‘include any other pre-
scribed information’. The regulations may provide that
this prescribed information include any Maori tradition-
al knowledge relied on by the applicant.

The Patents Act 2013 provides for revocation of a
granted patent.22 Whilst ‘any person’ may commence a
revocation proceeding, there is no provision in the legis-
lation for the advisory committee to have the ability to
revoke a patent.

Plant variety rights
The tribunal found that ‘while Maori have no propri-
etary rights in taonga species, the cultural relationship
between kaitiaki and taonga species is entitled to reason-
able protection’.23

The tribunal was asked to consider whether the
propagation, sale and export of taonga species should be
restricted to kaitiaki only. The tribunal believed that

there should be no such restriction, ﬁnding that the
propagation, sale and/or export of taonga species are not
inconsistent with the kaitiaki relationship. The tribunal
said that it is desirable to encourage businesses and indi-
viduals dedicated to the re-vegetation of New Zealand in
native ﬂora, and that such re-vegetation is consistent
with the kaitiaki relationship.24

The tribunal recommended that:25
(i) any new Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation
should include a power to refuse a PVR if it would
affect kaitiaki relationships with taonga species;
and

(ii) the Commissioner of Plant Variety Rights should
be supported by the same advisory committee as
recommended for patents.

Matauranga Maori
The tribunal considered the roles of government agen-
cies in three sectors: culture and heritage; education; and
research, science and technology. The tribunal said there
was a clear necessity for the government and Maori to
work in partnership, as ‘[p]rotecting and transmitting
ma¯tauranga Maori is a responsibility shared between
Maori and the Crown; neither party can succeed without
the help of the other . . .’.26 It recommended the establish-
ment of viable partnership models, and the application of
a series of principles to include ‘Crown co-ordination,
appropriate prioritisation, sufﬁcient resourcing, and
shared objective-setting with Maori’.27

Reactions of the Government
of New Zealand
The government has not made a formal response to the
Wai 262 Report or to the recommendations contained in
the report, nor has it communicated a timeframe for
responding. We understand that a ‘whole-of-govern-
ment’ response to the report is to be prepared.

The Attorney-General has advised that signiﬁcant
work has been undertaken ‘to review the ﬁndings and
recommendations of
in Ko
Aotearoa Te¯nei, to locate this work within the context
of Crown-Maori relationships generally, and to con-
sider domestic and international policy settings and
issues’.28

None of the recommendations proposed for trade marks,

designs or plant variety rights has been implemented.

New Zealand’s patent legislation has recently been
updated. The Patents Act 2013 provides for an advisory
committee, but with more limited functions than were
recommended in the Wai 262 Report.

Other developments
Toi Iho—Maori-made trade mark
The Toi Iho scheme was developed in February 2002 as a
trade mark for quality and authentic Maori artworks
under the government’s art body, Creative New Zealand.
Creative New Zealand decided to stop investing in this
brand. Creative New Zealand has publicly stated that the
Toi Iho concept ‘failed to deliver on its promise in terms
of increasing sales of Maori art by licensed artists and
stockists (retailers)’ and accordingly ‘the funds that sup-
ported its operation will be reallocated to other Creative
New Zealand Maori arts development initiatives’.29

Anecdotally, it was said that some renowned Maori
artists considered it inappropriate that they should be
required to submit work for appraisal by their peers, and
considered that use of the Toi Iho brand would not be an
advantage because they had established reputations.

A core group of supporters of the Toi Iho concept
were able to convince Creative New Zealand to transfer
all rights in this trade mark to a new entity entitled Toi
Iho Kaitiaki Incorporated (TIKI), which would assume
responsibility for administering the Toi Iho brand. An
agreement was reached in 2010 whereby TIKI acquired
the Toi Iho brand.

Ka Mate haka
The haka (action song) ‘Ka Mate’ was composed in the
1820s by Te Rauparaha, a rangatira (chief) of the iwi
(tribe, people) Nga¯ti Toa Rangatira (Nga¯ti Toa). At the
time, Te Rauparaha was being chased by an enemy, and
while receiving shelter from an ally, penned what was to
become one of New Zealand’s most well-known haka
both domestically and overseas.

Nga¯ti Toa see the Ka Mate haka as an integral part of
their history, culture and identity, representing the sur-
vival of Te Rauparaha and their iwi. Nga¯ti Toa also
regard themselves as the kaitiaki of the Ka Mate haka.

In 2009, Nga¯ti Toa attempted to register phrases from
the Ka Mate haka (including KA MATE) to allow them
to stop third parties from commercially exploiting words
and phrases from the haka. These applications were

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2014, Vol. 9, No. 5

opposed by a New Zealand souvenir company, Prokiwi
International Limited, which sold, amongst other things,
tea towels bearing the words of the Ka Mate haka.
Prokiwi International Limited was not the only operator
selling similar souvenirs of this kind at the time.30

The opposition succeeded on the ground that the
marks are non-distinctive. The commissioner found that:
‘[i]t is clear from the evidence before me that certain
traders of New Zealand themed goods and services will,
in the ordinary course of their business, wish to legitim-
ately use the entire wording of the haka Ka Mate because
the haka Ka Mate is an important part of New Zealand’s
heritage, a New Zealand icon, and is a powerful reference
to New Zealand . . .’. If
the phrases were registered,
‘honest traders would effectively be hindered in using the
haka Ka Mate in relation to New Zealand themed
merchandise and commercial sporting events in New
Zealand, because they would be uncertain whether they
were exposed to infringement proceedings’.31

Since this decision, Nga¯ti Toa has initialled a Deed of
Settlement32 with the Crown, which amongst other
things provides for recognition and acknowledgement of
their connections to the Ka Mate haka.33 Under the Deed
of Settlement, the Crown must pass legislation that:
† acknowledges the Ka Mate haka is a taonga of Nga¯ti
† acknowledges the Ka Mate haka is an integral part of
† acknowledges the statement of association made by

the history, culture, and identity of Nga¯ti Toa;

Toa;

Nga¯ti Toa Rangatira relating to:

(a) the composition of the Ka Mate haka by Te Rau-

paraha;

(b) Nga¯ti Toa’s particular cultural, spiritual, historical,
and traditional association with the Ka Mate haka;

(c) Nga¯ti Toa’s ongoing role as kaitiaki of the Ka

Mate haka;

(d) Nga¯ti Toa’s values concerning the use and per-

formance of the Ka Mate haka; and

† provides for the Crown recognition that Nga¯ti Toa

Rangatira hold the right of attribution.

The right of attribution provides that Te Rauparaha be
identiﬁed clearly and reasonably as the composer and

rangatira of Nga¯ti Toa in any publication of the Ka Mate
haka for commercial purposes, in any communication of
the Ka Mate haka to the public, and in any ﬁlm that fea-
tures the Ka Mate haka and is shown in public or issued
to the public. The right of attribution does not apply to
public performances of the Ka Mate haka, use of the Ka
Mate haka that is made for educational purposes, or in
any work made for the purpose of criticism, review, or
news reporting. Should a third party fail to acknowledge
Nga¯ti Toa or Te Rauparaha, then representatives from
Nga¯ti Toa can enforce the right of attribution in the
courts and recover their costs for doing so.

The proposed legislation34 will not confer on Nga¯ti
Toa any entitlement to require consent in advance of any
treatment of the Ka Mate haka. In addition, the proposed
legislation does not entitle Nga¯ti Toa to charge, levy or
accept any form of royalties, compensation or damages
in any treatment of the use of the Ka Mate haka.

The proposed legislation must also be reviewed in ﬁve
years’ time to determine whether the protection granted
is adequate and/or whether the Ka Mate haka is better
protected by other generic legislation in place. This sug-
gests that the government anticipates introducing legis-
lation that could provide more generic and broader
rights to owners of Maori intellectual property.

The proposed Ka Mate legislation is new and innova-
tive. However, the legislation does not enable Ngati Toa
to stop culturally offensive or unauthorized commercial
use of the Ka Mate haka, and thus may fall short of what
was originally proposed.

Science and matauranga Maori
The tribunal noted that ‘[t]he greatest collaboration
between Maori and the science sector seems to occur at
the furthest remove from the policy-makers, and at the
practical level of those conducting the actual research.35

Many successful collaborations have involved use of
ma¯tauranga Maori and Western science to produce
beneﬁcial outcomes, and to address/solve challenges,
including health and environmental challenges. These
collaborations have taken place between local Maori
communities and scientiﬁc agencies and/or research
institutes. Examples include:
† Harvesting of freshwater crayﬁsh (lake ko¯ura) using
the traditional tau ko¯ura method on Lake Rotoiti36
(Te Arawa and the Te Arawa Lakes Trust);

challenges faced by the tı¯tı¯ (sooty shearwater, mutton-
bird) population,
including insights gleaned from
ma¯tauranga Maori, with a view to enhance the sustain-
ability of the species and its harvesting as a traditional
food source38 (Hauraki Maori, Landcare Research);
† Collection of ma¯tauranga Maori concerning kereru¯
(New Zealand pigeon) from Tu¯hoe Tuawhenua elders,
including knowledge of the distribution, survival and
breeding habits of these birds. This knowledge is used
to inform the management of ecological systems affect-
ing the species39 (Tu¯hoe Tuawhenua Trust, Landcare
Research);

Television channel and is supported by the Ministry of
Business, Innovation & Employment.

Publicizing a rich resource
The Wai 262 decision is considered to be one of the most
signiﬁcant decisions issued by the Waitangi Tribunal,
and the report itself generated signiﬁcant publicity. This
publicity has exposed the wider New Zealand public to
the issues raised in the claim and report, and to ma¯taur-
anga Maori as a unique, rich and valuable resource.

The government states it is working on its formal re-
sponse to the report, and we could have assumed the
amendments to the Patents Act were in response to the
tribunal’s report. In fact, these amendments were pro-
posed before the tribunal’s report, and were purposely
delayed to provide the government with an opportunity
to incorporate any additional points raised by the
tribunal. While the Patents Act amendments go some
way to address the issues raised by the tribunal, not all
the tribunal’s additional recommendations were subse-
quently incorporated into the amendments.

Other developments in New Zealand around the pro-
tection of ma¯tauranga Maori have primarily been driven

by Maori for a speciﬁc purpose or to address a speciﬁc
issue. Some of these initiatives have been supported by,
or received funding from government, but government
driven initiatives still await some formal direction.

The government has not yet given a timeframe for its
response to the tribunal’s report and, as it is election year
in New Zealand, the formal response could be left to the
next government.
