A Dutch bankruptcy: how does it affect
intellectual property, licensors and licensees?
Gino van Roeyen and Denise Verdoold*

The Netherlands is an important hub for trade, attract-
ing international business. The country has become home
to several renowned multinationals, quite often via so-
called special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Such SPVs are
typically used to either transfer a company’s intellectual
property rights (IPRs) into the Netherlands or to license
those rights. These SPVs are in most cases set up to
become licensors for the purpose of inter-company or
third-party licensing. Since this practice forms a crucial
pivot for international business, it is essential that the in-
tellectual property rights lying at the core of this business
are well protected.

When a company established in the Netherlands is
declared bankrupt, a trustee is appointed by the compe-
tent court and all the company’s assets become subject to
a general ‘freeze’ in order for the trustee to pursue their li-
quidation. The company thus loses the capacity to trade
with the assets, including its intellectual property rights.
The main task of the trustee is to settle the bankruptcy in
the interest of the company’s creditors. Accordingly, the
trustee has the power to sell and transfer the relevant in-
tellectual property rights for as high a price as possible.

It is a common perception that unencumbered prop-
erty has a greater market value and may be sold at a
higher selling price than property which, for example, has
been licensed. Accordingly, licences are often regarded as
having a price-reducing effect in intellectual property
sales. However, for a number of reasons, third parties
interested in buying intellectual property may also settle
for a ‘licence included’ purchase. For example, the third
party purchaser may require the intellectual property to
be licensed if it does not have the means of exploitation
itself. Further, royalty payments to which a licensee may
be bound under a licence agreement may prove a valuable
source of income.

If, despite the possible desirability of purchasing
licensed intellectual property, the bankruptcy trustee
seeks to transfer the relevant rights free from licences,
several legal issues arise, including the (limitations to)
the powers of the trustee with regard to the intellectual
property rights and the effect of the bankruptcy on the
legal position of licensors, licensees and third parties.

main task is to settle the bankruptcy in the inter-
est of the company’s creditors. Accordingly, the
trustee has the power to sell and transfer the intel-

for

amongst others regarding the (limitations to) the
powers of the trustee with regard to the intellec-
tual property rights and the effect of the bank-
ruptcy on the legal position of licensors, licensees
and third parties.

† In this article, the authors seek to provide some
insight and guidance with regard to these legal
questions. For this purpose, the article focuses on
(the impact of) two judgments of the Dutch
Supreme Court
in the so-called Nebula and
Berzona cases, which are regarded as pivotal in
this light.

In this article the authors seek to provide some
insight and guidance with regard to these legal issues in
the light of both case law and legal principle. For a clear
understanding of the issues involved, the authors ﬁrst
provide a succinct overview of bankruptcy law in the
Netherlands.

Bankruptcy law in the Netherlands
at a glance
Bankruptcy proceedings in the Netherlands are governed
by the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A debtor who has ceased
to pay his debts may be declared bankrupt by a district
court following a petition for bankruptcy. The debtor
may be a legal or a natural person. The bankruptcy peti-
tion may be ﬁled by the debtor’s creditors or by the
debtor himself.

The creditor ﬁling the bankruptcy petition must es-
tablish that he has a monetary claim against the debtor,
that the debtor has ceased to pay his debts and that he
has at least one more creditor.

Following the grant of a bankruptcy order by the dis-
trict court, the court appoints a bankruptcy trustee (in
most cases an attorney-at-law). The trustee acts under
the supervision of a member of the court.

The main task of the trustee in the bankruptcy proceed-
ings is to liquidate the debtor’s assets in order to divide the
proceeds between the creditors. As a general rule all cred-
itors are equal and should be treated equally, but there are
exceptions to this rule. Secured creditors such as mort-
gagees and pledgees, for example, can ignore the bankrupt-
cy and can, as a general rule, sell the mortgaged or pledged
property publicly in order to obtain payment of the debt.

The bankruptcy order freezes all assets (all property, in-
cluding intangible property) of the debtor in order to li-
quidate those assets for the beneﬁt of the creditors. The
debtor is no longer entitled to manage and dispose of these
assets as the trustee takes over these powers. Transactions
by the debtor concluded after the bankruptcy do not bind
the estate unless they are beneﬁcial to the estate or the
trustee accepts the obligations arising from the transactions.
Upon appointment, the bankruptcy trustee is entrusted
with the preservation, administration and liquidation of
the bankrupt’s estate. Actions and claims from all cred-
itors are stayed. The bankruptcy trustee is entitled to con-
tinue the business of the bankrupt if the supervisory
judge agrees. Assets of the bankrupt may be sold (at a
public auction or privately on approval of the supervisory
judge) by the bankruptcy trustee if this is not contrary to
third-party ownership or security rights.

The leading principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the
so-called paritas creditorum, which means that all creditors
have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of
the bankrupt’s estate shall be distributed in proportion
to the size of each creditor’s claims. In order to obtain
payment of the proportion of the proceeds to which they

ECLI:NL:HR:2014:1681 (Berzona).

are entitled, any unsecured creditor must submit their
claims in writing to the trustee for validation.

There are two groups of creditors to whom the prin-
ciple of paritas creditorum does not apply: secured cred-
itors and creditors who have a preference by virtue of the
Dutch Civil Code or any other relevant statute.

Secured creditors, for example those with a mortgage,
pledge or charge, have the right of summary foreclosure
and may sell the secured property, thereby ignoring the
bankruptcy. Following the foreclosure, secured creditors
are entitled to the proceeds before unsecured creditors.

Preferred creditors are, unlike secured creditors, not
entitled to initiate foreclosure proceedings. They are
required to present their claims to the trustee. Upon dis-
tribution of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate, the
secured creditors receive payment before the unsecured
creditors on a pro rata basis.

Creditors with insolvency claims are entitled to the
proceeds of the realization of the debtor’s assets. Insolv-
ency claims are claims that have arisen before the
opening of the proceedings. Certain claims are regarded
as claims against the estate. In general, claims which
arise as a result of or following an adjudication of bank-
ruptcy are considered claims against the estate. Exam-
ples include the salary of the bankruptcy trustee, the
cost of liquidating the estate and the wages of employees
of the bankrupt company as of the date of the bankrupt-
cy adjudication. Claims against the estate have to be sat-
isﬁed immediately and do not have to be submitted to
the trustee for validation.

The Nebulaand Berzonadecisions
Two decisions of the Hoge Raad (the Dutch Supreme
Court) led to the topicality of these issues in Dutch intel-
lectual property practice since their delivery in 2006 and
2014 respectively.1 Curiously, the litigation which gave
rise to these decisions did not concern intellectual prop-
erty or licence litigation in a bankruptcy context at all.
On the contrary, the decisions concern private property
leases. For a thorough understanding of the implications
of these cases for intellectual property practice, it is ne-
cessary to give a full and detailed account of the related
facts, as well as to the considerations of the Hoge Raad.

The facts of Nebula can be summarized as follows. Nebula

with two apartments. Nebula transferred the economic
ownership of the property to a party known in the judg-
ment as A B.V. With the consent of Nebula, A B.V. trans-
ferred the economic ownership of the property to a party
known as B B.V. In the agreement regulating the latter
transfer, several parts of the agreement between Nebula
and A B.V. were referred to and declared applicable. B
B.V. then entered into an agreement leasing one of the
apartments to C & D (anonymous natural persons). After
Nebula was declared bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee
initiated legal proceedings against C and D, seeking their
eviction and arguing that Nebula had remained the
owner of the property. According to the trustee, C and D
were living in the apartment without being entitled to do
so as there existed no contractual relationship between
Nebula and C and D. In ﬁrst instance, the trustee pre-
vailed, but the Court of Appeal reversed this decision. The
trustee successfully appealed to the Hoge Raad.

The Hoge Raad considered that this case turned on
whether the economic owner of immovable property
was allowed to lease this property following the bank-
ruptcy of the legal owner of the property, with binding
effect upon the bankrupt estate.

The Hoge Raad ﬁrst considered that the Dutch legisla-
tor has refrained from regulating or deﬁning the concept
of ‘economic property’ in the Dutch Civil Code. Accord-
ingly, it found that this term should be regarded as a
general term, not being interpreted autonomously in the
same manner as the legal relationship between the parties
who contractually created the economic property. In this
light, the Hoge Raad referred to its decision in Stichting
B.V. Vagobel v Geldnet, in which it held that economic
property is not legal property, the term ‘economic prop-
erty’ only aiming at the existence of contractual rights and
obligations with regard to an object, where these rights do
not necessarily have the same meaning in all cases.2

Secondly, the Hoge Raad considered that, under Dutch
insolvency law, a bankruptcy has no inﬂuence at all on re-
ciprocal agreements and leaves the obligations of the bank-
rupt and his contracting parties unchanged.3 However,
according to the Hoge Raad, this does not imply that a
creditor party to a long term agreement with a contract-
ing party who has been declared bankrupt is allowed to
execute his rights under this agreement as if there was no
bankruptcy. The Hoge Raad clariﬁed that any other view

would have the effect of ignoring the principle of equal-
ity of creditors, which forms the basis of the Dutch In-
solvency Act, in an unacceptable way. The same is true
where an agreement does not require the bankrupt to
actively perform an obligation but simply to tolerate
certain use of his property. If the contracting party of the
bankrupt debtor could require the trustee to tolerate the
continued use of the property, this would effectively
enable the creditor to ignore the bankruptcy. According
to the Hoge Raad, creditors may ignore the bankruptcy
only in exceptional situations explicitly regulated by
statute.4 Allowing creditors to do so in other situations,
it ruled, would also seriously complicate a good manage-
ment (by the trustee—GvR/DV) of the property, being
part of the bankruptcy estate for which long-term agree-
ments exist.

The Hoge Raad concluded, contrary to the decision of
the Court of Appeal that, following the bankruptcy of
Nebula, B as the economic owner of the immovable
property could no longer invoke its right of use with
regard to this property against the trustee of Nebula’s
estate. This is not changed by the right of use not being
affected by the bankruptcy of Nebula, on the basis of the
Hoge Raad’s second consideration.

Berzona
In 2014, the Hoge Raad delivered its decision in Berzona.5
In this case ABN AMRO Bank N.V. had ﬁled a request for
bankruptcy against Berzona B.V., which had failed to pay
its debts to the bank. According to ABN AMRO, Berzona
had also left other creditors unpaid. Under Dutch bank-
ruptcy law, one of the requirements to obtain a bankrupt-
cy order is the existence of prima facie evidence of a
‘second creditor’ claim, the rationale being that a bank-
ruptcy aims at dividing the assets of the debtor between
his joint creditors. Obtaining a bankruptcy order against
a debtor with only one creditor would be in conﬂict with
this rationale. According to this condition, a creditor
other than the creditor seeking to obtain the bankruptcy
order must have a separate claim against the debtor. ABN
AMRO relied on alleged claims of creditors leasing ﬂats of
Berzona to fulﬁl this requirement. The claims of these
lessees allegedly arose from their right to quiet enjoyment
under a lease, as well as Berzona’s obligation under the

lease to perform maintenance on the ﬂats. Berzona denied
that ABN AMRO had a directly collectable claim against
Berzona and also denied that the alleged claims of the
lessees could serve as second creditor claims required for
the grant of the bankruptcy order.

Both the District Court in ﬁrst instance and the Court
of Appeal rejected the bankruptcy order request for
failure to meet the second creditor claim requirement.
The Hoge Raad took a different view, referring to the re-
quirement of prima facie evidence of a second creditor
claim in order for a bankruptcy order to be granted.
Citing established case law, the Hoge Raad considered
that the justiﬁcation for this requirement was the under-
lying notion of a bankruptcy being aimed at the division
of the debtor’s capital between his joint creditors. This
aim would be nugatory if a bankruptcy order could be
obtained where a debtor had only one creditor.

In order for a claim to qualify as a second creditor
claim, the Hoge Raad established that it should be viable
to be presented for validation in the bankruptcy, so that
the creditor can eventually share in the proﬁt when the
bankruptcy estate is liquidated. Viable claims also include
those for which the exact value is unknown at the time of
validation, as well as non-monetary claims. Accordingly,
claims for maintenance and quiet enjoyment under a
lease may qualify as second creditor claims. However, as
ABN AMRO had failed to establish that Berzona had
breached its obligation for maintenance under the lease,
there was merely a possible future claim for maintenance,
which could be presented for validation. Accordingly, the
claim could not serve as a second creditor claim.

With regard to the claim for quiet enjoyment under a
lease, the Hoge Raad considered that, in the absence of
differing statements from ABN AMRO, the starting
point should be that the obligation to grant the lessees
quiet enjoyment under the lease was met at the time of
the application for the bankruptcy order. Having estab-
lished this, the Hoge Raad ruled as follows.

As in its ruling in Nebula, the Hoge Raad conﬁrmed,
referring to the explanatory notes to the Dutch Insolv-
ency Act, that a bankruptcy does not have any inﬂuence
on existing reciprocal agreements and does not therefore
lead to a change of the obligations following from such
agreements. However, on the basis of Article 37(1) of the
Dutch Insolvency Act, the trustee is entitled not to
perform the bankrupt’s obligations under a reciprocal

agreement upon request of the contracting party of
the debtor. Article 37(1) of the Dutch Insolvency Acts
reads:

If the obligations under a mutual agreement, at the time of
the declaration of bankruptcy, have not been performed at
all or only partially by both the debtor and his contracting
party and the bankruptcy trustee does not declare himself,
within a reasonable period determined for this purpose by
the contracting party in writing, to be prepared to perform
his obligations under the agreement, the bankruptcy trustee
loses his right to claim performance.6

The Hoge Raad, acknowledging this power of the bank-
ruptcy trustee and explicitly referring to Nebula, held that
the claims arising from the non-performance by the
trustee of obligations under reciprocal agreements could
be presented for validation in the bankruptcy. Even so,
the trustee only has the right to (‘passive’)7 non-perform-
ance of contractual obligations, which concerns obliga-
tions which must be fulﬁlled out of or at the expense of
the bankruptcy estate, such as a payments, delivery of
goods or the creation of a right. In contrast, trustees do
not (‘actively’)8 non-perform obligations under a con-
tract as they are not entitled to any actions which statute
or agreement does not grant them, such as actions for
eviction or to assert ownership of the leased property
if the lease is still in force. This would oppose the princi-
ple underlying the Dutch Civil Code that a bankruptcy
does not have any inﬂuence on existing reciprocal agree-
ments.

Signiﬁcantly, the Hoge Raad clariﬁed that Nebula es-
sentially contained no other decision, but offers a single-
sentence summary that ‘the Nebula decision concerns
matter other than the matter at hand’. Nebula is held to
concern only the question whether the trustee is bound
by a lease agreement which has been entered into by the
economic owner of property after the bankruptcy of the
legal owner of the leased property on the basis of a con-
tractual authorization of the legal owner.

Now addressing the issue raised in Berzona, the Hoge
Raad held that, if the lessee at the time of ﬁling a bank-
ruptcy request quiet enjoys a lease, the trustee has no au-
thority to end this enjoyment if the lease agreement is still
in force. In that case, the claim for quiet enjoyment under
a lease does not constitute a claim that can be presented
for validation in the bankruptcy. Accordingly, it cannot

the Hoge Raad uses it appears that it refers to situations where the trustee
has a contractual obligation to do something and does not comply with
that obligation by failing to perform such action.

that the trustee does not gain any extra enforceable rights from the
bankruptcy as such. The rights which the trustee wishes to enforce must be
derived from existing agreements or statute.

serve as a second creditor claim, taking into account the
requirement explained above that there be more than one
creditor in order for a bankruptcy order to be granted.

Application of Nebulaand Berzonato a
bankruptcy involving IPRs and licensing
Introductory remarks
Nebula led to a general belief in the view that the Hoge
Raad had entitled the trustee not to perform contractual
obligations, which could have negative impacts on intellec-
tual property licences. Berzona seemed to have somewhat
weakened this belief, although it has certainly not been dis-
pelled.9 Accordingly, practice has come up with various
constructions to create ‘bankruptcy-proof’ licences. Van
Zanten offers an insight into the different ways practice
has sought to curb the ‘right of the trustee to breach of
contract’:

For instance, experiments were conducted and philosophies
were developed concerning the (effect of) encumbrance of
intellectual property rights with usufruct rights, transfers of
intellectual property rights on the condition precedent that
bankruptcy would nullify the transfer and unconditional
transfers to administration foundations. In addition, many—
less far-reaching and as a result less secure—contractual
constructions were suggested, which not so much prevent
that the rights of licensees would be interfered with, but that
should provide the trustee with an incentive not to do so,
such as mounting royalty obligations or bonuses at the end
of the term of the contract.

As, in the view of the authors, the Hoge Raad in Nebula
and Berzona did not recognize the trustee’s right to default
on the contractual obligations of the bankrupt, nor did it
suggest that the trustee has such a right, the question
arises as to what the effect of these two decisions actually
has on intellectual property licensing practice.

For the purpose of providing insight into the answer
of this question, it is now necessary to examine the pos-
sible consequences of Nebula and Berzona in the case of

10 As matters concerning the conﬂict of laws, which may arise here, would
unnecessarily complicate our case example, it is assumed that Dutch law
governs the bankruptcy.

the bankruptcy of the licensor, followed by the situation
in which the licensee is declared bankrupt.

When a licensor located in the Netherlands
is declared bankrupt
In this situation, licensor A, a company having its statutory
seat in the Netherlands, grants a licence to licensee B allow-
ing B to undertake certain actions with regard to the IPRs
owned by A. At a certain point in time, after the licence
agreement has been entered into, licensor A goes bankrupt
and a bankruptcy trustee is appointed in the Netherlands.10
The bankruptcy trustee will clearly use his best efforts
to maximize the value of the estate in the interest of
the creditors. As intellectual property in many instances
accounts for a substantial part of a company’s economic
value, the bankruptcy trustee will probably wish to sell the
bankrupt’s intellectual property free from any licences.

Directly after Nebula, the view that a trustee is entitled
to default an agreement became and still is a popular
mantra.11 The authors, however, share a contrary view.
Close reading of Nebula learns that this decision does
not pave the way for a general rule which justiﬁes the
trustee in a bankruptcy estate to default on agreements
which are in force when the request for bankruptcy was
ﬁled. In addition, as indicated above, the Hoge Raad in
Berzona clariﬁed that it follows from Article 37(1) of the
Dutch Insolvency Act that a bankruptcy does not affect
reciprocal agreements, notwithstanding the trustee’s en-
titlement to decide not to perform certain ‘passive’ obli-
gations arising out of such agreements.

As the Hoge Raad in Nebula states, a trustee may not
ﬁnd it in the interest of the bankruptcy estate to perform
contractual obligations. Accordingly, the interest of the
bankruptcy estate is said to play the role of determining
whether a claim arising out of contractual obligations
will be performed by the trustee or be left to be pre-
sented for validation. The trustee must consider this
carefully before deciding that the bankruptcy estate will
not comply with obligations arising out of an agreement.
It is this careful consideration which arguably renders it

necessary to refrain from the mantra that the Hoge Raad
in Nebula accepted an absolute right of the trustee to
default on contractual obligations. The Hoge Raad has not
done so and, moreover, emphasized in Berzona that
Nebula only affects whether the trustee is bound by a lease
which has been entered into after the bankruptcy of the
legal owner of the property leased by the economic owner
of that property on the basis of a contractual authorization
which the legal owner has provided to that end. Nebula
thus concerns a highly speciﬁc situation and is not a ﬁt
basis from which to make a generalization. One way or
another, the approach of the Hoge Raad in Berzona
strengthens the opinion of the authors that the Hoge Raad
warns practice not to read into Nebula what it did not
decide (the mantra that the trustee is simply entitled to
‘say hello and wave goodbye’ to contractual obligations).

In addition, the Hoge Raad in Berzona stressed that a
bankruptcy order does not have the consequence of
granting the trustee an ‘active’12 right or action which
statute or contract do not assign to him/her.

This leads us to the following conclusions with regard
to whether the trustee is entitled to sell the intellectual
property free from licences to a third party. The mindset
of a trustee of a bankrupt intellectual property owner
with regard to a reciprocal licence agreement13 should
initially be that the bankruptcy does not affect this agree-
ment. Secondly, the trustee should carefully consider
and investigate whether a sale and transfer of the intel-
lectual property free from licences to a third party would
be beneﬁcial to the joint creditors of the bankruptcy.
Thirdly, if such a sale and transfer seems to be in the
interest of the joint creditors, the trustee should deter-
mine which are the relevant obligations with respect to
such sale and transfer that are laid down or can be
derived from the licence agreement. These obligations
should be identiﬁed by the trustee in order to administer
the points on which he/she intends to default on the
agreement. Finally, the trustee has to take into account
that he cannot enforce rights or bring any action against
the licensee which have not been agreed upon and which
cannot be derived from statute. Thus where there is no
contractual or statutory basis the trustee is not entitled
to prohibit the licensee from performing his rights and

12 Again, note the quotation marks used by the Hoge Raad, which sought to
clarify that the trustee does not gain any extra enforceable rights from the
bankruptcy as such. The rights which the trustee is allowed to enforce must
be derived from an existing agreement or from statute.

13 Nebula and Berzona only concern reciprocal agreements.
14 Article 2.33 of the Benelux Convention on Intellectual Property and

Related Rights (2006) (BCIP) and Article 23 of the European Trade Mark
Regulation 207/2009 regarding trade marks, article 3.27 BCIP and Article
33 of the European Community Design Regulation 6/2002 regarding
registered design rights and article 56 of the Dutch Patent Act 1995
regarding patents.

obligations under the licence agreement in order to fa-
cilitate a sale and transfer of the intellectual property free
from licences.

As an aside, when determining the actions of the
trustee in the light of current contracts after a bankrupt-
cy order, the Hoge Raad’s ruling that the trustee does not
have any ‘active’ rights or actions which are not assigned
to him by agreement or statute need not be forgotten.
For instance, where the licensee of the bankrupt breaches
its obligations under the licence agreement, the trustee
may be held to be entitled to invoke the rights of the
bankrupt trade mark proprietor against the licensee on
the basis of Article 2.32(2) of the Benelux Convention on
Intellectual Property (BCIP), which states that the trade
mark proprietor make invoke its exclusive rights against
licensees breaching the terms of their licence agreements
relating to, inter alia, the scope of use of the trade mark
allowed by the licence or the territory in which the trade
mark may be used by the licensee. Despite qualifying as
an ‘active’ right or action, the trustee arguably has this
power as the BCIP (a statute) assigns this right to him.

There is another reason why the authors defend this
reasoning. Save for the Dutch Copyright Act and the le-
gislation concerning the unregistered Community design
as laid down in European Community Design Regulation
6/2002, all intellectual property right statutes and regula-
tions in force in the Netherlands provide for the registra-
tion of licences in a public register.14 The effect of such a
registration is that the licence can be invoked against third
parties.15 A registered licence allows for a defence of the li-
censee against a third party who has purchased and owns
the licensed intellectual property to respect the licence
(agreement).

A careful trustee should determine whether the IPR
he wishes to sell and transfer to a third party is encum-
bered by registered licences and a third party interested
in purchasing that IPR should certainly investigate this
independently. Although a trustee who sells and trans-
fers an IPR free from licences, knowing that a licence
righto use it has been registered, may not risk a success-
ful claim from the licensee,16 the third party who pur-
chased that right may successfully bring a claim against
the trustee on the basis of a free-from-licences-clause in

15 The European Trade Mark Regulation 207/2009 and the European Design

Regulation 6/2002 even go further in case a licence is invoked against a
third party with knowledge of the registration of the licence in the registers.
Article 23(1) and 33(2) of these Regulations respectively state:
‘Nevertheless, such an act, before it is so entered, shall have effect vis-a`-vis
third parties who have acquired rights in the registered [Community
design or Community trade mark] after the date of that act but who knew
of the act at the date on which the rights were acquired.’

16 If the trustee acts according to the conclusions which the authors derive

from the Nebula and Berzona decisions set out above.

the purchase agreement. The bankruptcy does not affect
the registration of the licence and the effect of registra-
tion on third parties. However, the third party might
successfully argue that the trustee did not sell and trans-
fer the intellectual property as agreed. The risk of failing
to regard this as being quintessential is also a reason why
the authors object to reducing the Nebula decision to the
unjust mantra that a trustee is entitled to default with
regard to a reciprocal agreement.

It follows from the above that licence agreements
should, from the perspective of both the intellectual
property proprietor and the licensee, be designed with a
keen eye to bankruptcy situations. However, the protec-
tion of a licensee against the bankruptcy of a licensor by
virtue of an agreement, or statute for that matter, may
be far from watertight. A licensee can only pursue the
options best protecting his interests. This means, for
example, trying not to accept a bankruptcy termination
clause and demanding that the licence be registered in
order to hold the licence against third parties who may
obtain the licensed intellectual property from the trustee
when the licensor goes bankrupt.

There is also another side of the coin which may offer
some perspective for the intellectual property proprietor to
complicate the purchase and transfer of the intellectual
property free from licences. In case of a bankruptcy, the
registration of a licence might not be in the interest of the
intellectual property proprietor. Registration of the licence
has third party effect which may discourage third parties
wishing to obtain IPRs that are unencumbered. This might
open doors for a more fruitful restructuring of the insolv-
ent company. A similar effect, although less strong, may
follow from contractual provisions which aim at the con-
tinuation of a licence if the intellectual property owner is in
dire straits and ends up bankrupt. From the perspective of
Article 37(1) of the Dutch Insolvency Act, it might be
worthwhile to proﬁt from the continuation of the licence
agreement and seek to render such a continuation attract-
ive for the trustee as well as the joint creditors in whose
interest the trustee has to manage the bankruptcy estate.

When a licensee located in the Netherlands
goes bankrupt
The considerations which led the Hoge Raad to the
Nebula and Berzona decisions and the implications these
cases may have for intellectual property-related agree-
ments, may also play a role if a trustee needs to manage
the bankruptcy estate of the licensee.

As has been argued above, the trustee must determine
the implications of the continuation of the licence agree-
ment with a view to the management of the bankruptcy
estate in the interest of the joint creditors. The trustee
may rely on Article 37(1) of the Dutch Insolvency Act
allowing him/her not to perform certain obligations of
the agreement if this is in the interest of the bankrupt
licensee’s estate. This offers the trustee a certain freedom
to act. If, for example, royalties are due and payment of
these royalties is not in the interest of the bankruptcy
estate of the licensee, the trustee is entitled to refrain
from payment. Where payment is proﬁtable, the licence
agreement may be performed.17

The actions the trustee may take also depend on what
is agreed between the licensee and licensor. If the agree-
ment, for example, contains provisions taking effect
upon the bankruptcy of the licensee, this will as a general
rule have the effect of the licensee and thus the trustee
no longer being entitled to use the licensed intellectual
property, paving the way for infringement actions by the
intellectual property owner.18

Illustrative in this light is the following. The licence
agreement may stipulate that, on bankruptcy, the licen-
see is not allowed to dispose of any stock covered by the
terms of the licence agreement. On the basis of Article
37 of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act and the Nebula and
Berzona decisions, the trustee may continue to sell stock
despite this provision. After all, the trustee would argue
that the Hoge Raad in Berzona held that the trustee has
the right to decide not to perform contracts and non-
perform the obligations following from such contracts.
However, such a view would be contrary to the Hoge
Raad’s consideration that the trustee does not have an
‘active’ right which statute or agreement does not assign
to him. Accordingly, the trustee is not entitled to sell the
stock as the consideration of the Hoge Raad that the
trustee is allowed to decide not to perform contractual
obligations only grants the trustee an active right or to
claim that it follows from agreement or statute. In this
case, in the absence of a contractual or statutory right or
claim to this end, the trustee should refrain from selling
the stock.

If the trustee, despite the absence of an ‘active’ right,
seeks to sell the stock, the intellectual property proprietor
may have a claim against him/her on the basis of the
agreement or statute (trade mark infringement). In add-
ition, the agreement may provide for the suspension of
the performance of obligations under the contract in case
of a breach of the obligations on the part of the licensee

(ie trustee), which also might pave the way for an in-
fringement action and liability.

Some ﬁnal remarks
Legal doctrine and practice have erroneously distilled the
mantra from Nebula that the bankruptcy trustee is entitled
to breach contracts. This mantra does not do justice to the
balanced approach necessary to thoroughly understand
the complex problems that bankruptcies can cause for in-
tellectual property proprietors and licensees. Berzona
clearly offers proof of the Hoge Raad teaching that no
lessons can be learned from Nebula other than those expli-
citly laid down in that decision. In Berzona, the Hoge
Raad rightly stressed that the legal question it decided
upon in Nebula should be treated as case-speciﬁc, possibly
not having implications for situations differing from this
case. For intellectual property practice, Nebula would
imply that a party entitled to exploit intellectual property
rights on the basis of an agreement cannot enter into
agreements with third parties regarding the exploitation
of such rights after the bankruptcy of the intellectual
property proprietor. Accordingly, the Hoge Raad stresses
that, in Nebula, no general right of the trustee for non-
performance of reciprocal agreements was acknowledged.
On the contrary, it follows from Berzona (and this has
been signposted in Nebula) that bankruptcy does not

affect reciprocal agreements. Such agreements should in
principle be performed after bankruptcy, unless the trustee
has indicated upon request that he does not wish to
honour the contract, which the Hoge Raad explained as
non-performance of the contractual obligations. For re-
ciprocal agreements, this means that these remain valid,
unless contract or statute determines otherwise. The trustee
is not entitled to disregard these contracts—indicating
the importance of Berzona as compared to Nebula. On
the contrary, Berzona contains an assignment of the
Hoge Raad to bankruptcy trustees to perform a proper
investigation to the rights and obligations on the part of
the bankruptcy estate following from reciprocal agree-
ments. This trustee may not automatically non-perform
such agreements on the basis of Nebula. The trustee must
determine whether performing the obligations under the
agreement is in the interest of the bankruptcy estate. If this
is not the case, the trustee is entitled to non-performance
of such obligations. The justiﬁcation for non-performance
is to be found in the interest of the bankruptcy estate. This
is important to emphasize, as this may not be realized
in practice. In addition, the trustee should take into
account that the provisions of reciprocal agreements, as
well as statutory provisions, determine if and, if so,
which actions a trustee may invoke against the counter-
party. Bankruptcy as such does not provide the trustee
with additional rights to be invoked.
