 

The Rise of Safe Havens for Threatened 
Cultural Heritage
Nikolaus Thaddäus Paumgartner*

Abstract: In light of the recent rise of destruction and looting of cultural 
property, a need for formalized heritage protection has arisen. Increasingly 
popular in the debate has become the instrument of international assistance 
known as “safe havens.” These temporary refuges for at-risk cultural goods in 
a third country have recently been implemented by Switzerland, France, the 
United States, and the Association of Art Museum Directors. We assess the 
contributions and shortcomings of these four regimes using a comparative 
approach. Mainly, we find that, despite variations in their scope and structure, 
none of the models accounts entirely for today’s major difficulties in protecting 
endangered cultural properties. We draw recommendations for future safe haven 
states against the backdrop of the existing models and hope to see the instrument 
used in practice as a way to safely isolate cultural property from destructive 
conflicts.

INTRODUCTION

The rampant destruction and looting of millennia-old cultural property in coun-
tries subject to armed conflicts, such as Iraq, Syria, Mali, Egypt, or Afghanistan, 
has prompted international outrage during the last decade. Heritage destruction, 
as an instrument of war, has led to irreplaceable losses and the illicit trafficking of

cultural heritage items as a way to supplement the funding of militant groups.1 The 
instrument of international assistance known as “safe havens”—granting tempo-
rary refuges for at-risk cultural goods in a third country—has become increasingly 
popular recently in the debate on heritage protection.

Though of a hybrid nature, generally the following three main characteristics of safe 
havens may be identified: (1) they stem from international cultural heritage obliga-
tions that are related to cultural materials endangered by armed conflicts, terrorism, 
and natural disasters; (2) they are primarily a matter of national law; and (3) they 
give effect to ethical considerations of non-state actors that establish such facilities 
based on instruments of self-regulation. The first two characteristics are mirrored 
in the manifold international soft and hard law developments that ultimately led to 
Switzerland, the United States, and France adopting national laws on the granting of 
safe havens during the last three years, while further countries are expected to follow. 
The Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) is exemplary of the third char-
acteristic by issuing a self-regulatory framework for the provision of safe havens in 
the institutions of its members. Facing today’s challenges, safe havens are one instru-
ment that may contribute to better protecting threatened cultural heritage.

In this article, we first explore the recent history of safe havens as a safekeeping 
instrument for threatened cultural property. Next, we apply a comparative approach 
to analyze the conditions and modalities of the provision of safe havens in Switzerland, 
France, the United States as well as at the museum level. After assessing the four 
different safe havens models, we then discuss the contributions and shortcomings of 
each of the four models. Finally, and against the backdrop of the challenges identified 
in the previous section, we conclude by identifying recommendations for the future 
establishment and implementation of safe havens through national laws.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF SAFE HAVENS

First International Developments

Traditionally,  there  has  been  a  vast  international  humanitarian  practice  to  pro-
tect and safeguard cultural property evacuated from occupied territories. It is by 
virtue of international customary law that states have a duty to protect, preserve, 
and return property belonging to foreign states.2 Moreover, according to interna-
tional law, the property of foreign states is immune from jurisdiction and seizure.3 
Prominent examples for the granting of safe havens to works being endangered 
abroad can be found in Switzerland, though not on the basis of specific national 

1In this sense, archaeologists estimate that Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has looted up to USD  
300 million worth of antiquities. See Sangwon Yoon, “Islamic State Is Selling Looted Art Online for 
Needed Cash,” Bloomberg, 29 June 2015.

legal provisions. As early as the Spanish civil war (1936–39), the Musée d’art et 
d’histoire of Geneva provided a refuge for large numbers of paints from the col-
lection of the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid.4 More recently, from 2000 to 
2007, Afghan cultural material was stored for safekeeping in the privately owned 
Afghanistan Museum in Bubendorf, Switzerland.5 Lastly, the city of Geneva has 
been storing archaeological treasures from Gaza in the Geneva Freeport.6

Until the middle of the last century, states would grant such protection based 
on their own diverse set of practices, national (antiquities) laws, export controls, 
and rules and mechanisms of enforcement.7 The role of international law gained 
importance with the passing of the 1954 Hague Convention.8 Setting rules for the 
transport of cultural property outside an endangered territory and for its return 
at  the  end  of  the  hostilities,9  the  convention  constituted  the  first  worldwide 
international treaty focused exclusively on the safeguard of cultural property. The 
obligation of states to cooperate to preserve cultural heritage from destruction 
and misappropriation was further strengthened by several additional treaties that 
were subsequently passed in the course of the last few decades, most notably the 
1999 Second Protocol to the Hague Convention.10 International hard laws have 
been complemented by several political soft law commitments by states and by 
international mobilization campaigns. Prominent examples of such initiatives are 
“Unite4Heritage,” which was launched by the United Nations (UN) Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2015, as well as the 2015 Expert 
Committee report and resolution on the proposed extension of the doctrine of the 
“responsibility to protect” to cultural property—that is, acts of intentional destruc-
tion of cultural heritage would justify action from the UN Security Council.11

Though generally providing for the safeguarding of cultural property, neither 
international laws nor national implementations had yet to contain particular rules 
on the granting of safe havens for threatened cultural property. In response, the 
International Law Association adopted the Guidelines for the Establishment and 
Conduct of Safe Havens for Cultural Material (ILA Guidelines) in 2008.12 These 
guidelines constitute normative recommendations that act as a basis for states 
when establishing and conducting safe havens or when integrating the regime into 
their national laws. In essence, the ILA Guidelines and the appended Safe Haven 
Model  Contract  provide  for  non-binding  standards  for  safekeeping,  preserving, 
and returning cultural material on which governmental and non-governmental 
bodies—typically museums—may rely when establishing safe havens. Particular 
attention is given to the condition of care by both the safe haven state and the 
source state or entity.13 By providing for well-reflected and practical guidelines in 
a field so far characterized by uncertainty of standards and procedures, the ILA 
Guidelines contributed to the emergence of national safe haven implementation in 
the decade following their adoption.

The concept of granting safe havens dramatically gained importance during the 
international debate on heritage protection following the rise of the militant group of 
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the destruction and looting of millennia-
old cultural property as an instrument of war. It has only been recently that 40 states 
have committed to create an international network of safe havens, both at a national 
level and in third countries, by adopting the Abu Dhabi Declaration on Heritage at 
Risk in the Context of Armed Conflicts, 3 December 2016 (Abu Dhabi Declaration). 
As per the declaration, refuges in third countries shall be a solution of last resort and, 
in accordance with international law, be provided at the request of the governments 
concerned and take into account the national and regional characteristics and contexts 
of cultural property. The declaration also approves the setting up of a fund, an effort led 
by France and the United Arab Emirates, aiming to raise USD 100 million by 2019 for 
the implementation of programs for cultural property in danger on account of armed 
conflict.14 Following this initiative, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2347 
(2017) in order to encourage nations, inter alia, to consolidate their cultural property 
in a network of safe havens in their own territories.15 Concurrently with the rise of the

concept on the international stage, the proliferation of safe havens has recently found 
its way into the national laws of several states as outlined in the subsequent paragraphs.

Switzerland

In the course of the complete revision of its Federal Act on the Protection of 
Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, Disaster or Emergency Situa-
tions (PCPA), Switzerland was the first country to transpose this instrument into 
its national laws in 2015.16 Pursuant to Article 18 of the PCPA, the Swiss state may 
henceforth grant safe havens to cultural property being threatened abroad.

France

In the same vein, Jean-Luc Martinez, director of the Musée du Louvre, was charged 
by François Hollande, the former French president, with a mission concerning the 
protection of cultural goods in armed conflicts. In the respective report, Martinez 
argued that France should follow Switzerland, and he foresaw a legal instrument 
to enable the removal and the temporary storage of threatened cultural material.17 
Martinez’s report led to the proposed amendment “Palmyre” of the Projet de loi 
relatif à la liberté de création, architecture et patrimoine, including a novel article 
added to the Code du patrimoine that enables the French state to grant safe havens. 
The bill was finally adopted in July 2016, and the result is an instrument based on 
the Swiss model, but containing certain particularities.18 Since the law stipulates 
that the modalities of its application are to be determined by the Conseil d’État on 
an ordinance level and since this ordinance has not been passed to date, certain 
concretizations still remain to be seen.19

United States

The Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act was signed into 
law in the United States on 9 May 2016. It seeks to counter the black market trade 
of plundered Syrian cultural goods.  Inter alia, it imposes specified import restric-
tions (as set forth under section 307 of the Convention on Cultural Property 

16Bundesgesetz über den Schutz der Kulturgüter bei bewaffneten Konflikten, bei Katastrophen und 
in Notlagen, SR 520.3 (PCPA).

Implementation Act) with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material 
from Syria, as if Syria was a state party to the Convention on the Means of Pro-
hibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership 
of Cultural Property.20 The AAMD, in reaction to the first draft of the Protect 
and Preserve International Cultural Property Act introduced in the House of 
Representatives on 19 March 2015, released a statement in which it criticized 
the import restrictions for forbidding the entry into the United States of cul-
tural property that ISIS was in the process of destroying or that may be brought 
in by Syrian refugees, forcing the latter to leave their heritage in Syria, where it 
was most likely to be stolen or destroyed.21 The result was the addition to the 
bill of a waiver to the import restrictions regarding a temporary deposit of the 
(unlawfully  removed)  cultural  good  in  question,  which  led  to  a  form  of  safe 
haven that may be granted by the United States upon the request of the owner 
or custodian.

Other Countries

Germany, which also revised its Kulturgutschutzgesetz (Law on the Protection of 
Cultural Property), considered the option of establishing safe havens for Syrian 
and Iraqi cultural property.22 The proposition was introduced by the Deutsche 
Kulturrat but, in the end, was not implemented as part of the revision that came 
into force in August 2016.23

In February 2017, the United Kingdom’s (UK) Parliament passed the Cultural 
Property (Armed Conflicts) Act 2017 to implement the 1954 Hague Convention24 
and its First and Second Protocols,25 with the convention and the protocols subse-
quently being ratified in September 2017.26 Part 5, section 28, of the Cultural Prop-
erty (Armed Conflicts) Act 2017 implements the UK’s obligations under Article 14

of  the  convention  to  ensure  that  cultural  property  that  is  being  transported  for 
safekeeping may not be seized or forfeited while it is in the UK.27 In the case of 
cultural property being transported to the UK for which the UK has accepted the 
obligation to act as depository and safeguard under Article 18 of the Regulations 
for the Execution of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural 
Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, subsection (5) of the Act provides that the 
cultural property is protected while under the custody of the secretary of state or 
the person or institution the latter has designated responsible for its safekeeping.28 
In the event that the UK is requested to act as depositary, any cultural property 
should be appropriately housed and cared for, and such property should only be 
returned on cessation of the conflict.29 The government may make enquiries 
regarding the provenance of the cultural property in order to avoid bringing cul-
tural property with disputed ownership into the UK.30 According to Article 18 of 
these regulations, in such cases, the UK is to extend to the cultural property as great 
a measure of care as that which it bestows upon its own cultural property of com-
parable importance and only return the good on cessation of the conflict.

In Italy, a UNESCO Emergency Task Force for Culture has been established 
with the aim of protecting cultural sites and artifacts in zones of conflict. The 
task force will assist with the transfer of at-risk movable cultural heritage to safe 
havens.31 The implementation of safe havens into the national laws of Italy, however, 
does not seem to be planned at this current stage. In addition, China’s national 
body overseeing the protection of historical heritage has recently vowed to respond 
to  the  call  for  establishing  safe  havens.32  It  would  seem  that,  following  the  Abu 
Dhabi Declaration and the UN Security Council’s resolution outlined earlier and 
given the regulatory requirements associated with the granting of safe havens, it 
may be expected that further countries will follow and implement the concept in 
their national laws.

Criticisms

Not all states have embraced this evolution, with Greece and Egypt publicly raising 
concern about the concept of granting safe havens. Notably, contention arose

during Egypt’s adoption of Resolution 2347 (2017).33 In general, the creation of 
safe havens outside of national boundaries was seen as not respecting the principles 
of sovereignty and non-intervention.34 The Greek prime minister, on the other 
hand, argued that the transfer of objects into third countries should be a solu-
tion of last resort and that guarantees for their safe return should be established.35 
Throughout the last century, these countries were repeatedly at the center of dis-
putes over the return of cultural material. Illustratively, Greece has long sought 
the return of the Parthenon Marbles, sculptures removed from the Parthenon by 
Lord Elgin in the early 1800s and sold to the British Museum.36 Despite several 
petitions since Greece’s independence in 1832 and formal requests through the 
UN, the sculptures are still on permanent public display at the British Museum.37
AAMD

Concurrently with these legal developments, the AAMD, with its current network 
of 242 museum directors in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, has issued a set 
of guidelines on 1 October 2015 regarding the provision of safe havens for threatened 
cultural property by museums.38

under the respective safe haven regime. However, while both the French and the 
Swiss legislature use fairly broad definitions of cultural property, the US definition 
is relatively narrow and, therefore, more restrictive. The Swiss legislature refers to 
the definition of Article 1 of the Hague Convention, according to which cultural 
property shall cover all “movable or immovable property of great importance to 
the cultural heritage of every people.”39 The Hague Convention exemplifies this by 
enumerating manuscripts, books, and other objects of artistic, historical, or  
archaeological interest as well as scientific collections, important collections of 
books or archives, and reproductions of the property defined above.40 The defini-
tion of cultural property under the French Code du patrimoine is even broader; 
it covers all movable or immovable property that represents a historical, artistic, 
archaeological, aesthetic, scientific, or technical interest and does not, therefore, 
require that the object to be protected have a specific significance.41

Under the US regime, however, a safe haven may only be granted to designated 
material of archaeological or ethnological interest. In order to qualify as material 
of archaeological interest, the object must be of cultural significance, must be at 
least 250 years old, and must have been normally discovered as a result of scientific 
excavation, clandestine or accidental digging, or exploration on land or under-
water.  Ethnological  objects  are  defined  as  products  of  a  tribal  or  non-industrial 
society and as important to the cultural heritage of a people because of the objects’ 
distinctive characteristics, comparative rarity, or contribution to the knowledge 
of the origins, development, or history of that people.42 In addition, the mate-
rial must, in theory, form part of the Designated List of Archeological Material of 
Syria issued by the secretary. However, the designated list “covers all archeological 
and ethnological material of Syria” and, thus, does not include further restrictions. 
Considering that these conditions are cumulative, the scope of the US regime is 
significantly more restrictive than the other two jurisdictions. However, it should 
be kept in mind that all material not qualifying thereunder may be imported with-
out the import restriction applying and, therefore (in theory) is granted protection 
in the United States (though not under the safe haven regime).

Endangerment in a Third State

Threat

According to the Swiss law, the cultural property must be under threat, while, in 
France, it must be subject to a situation of emergency and of serious danger in the

third state.43 In both cases, the endangerment does not depend on the origin of the 
situation of danger but, rather, on the probable impact of the danger on the cul-
tural good.44 Regarding the aim of a vast protection of both laws, we expect that the 
Swiss Federal Council and the Conseil d’État would interpret the notion broadly.45
Under the US legislation, which is linked directly to the Syrian conflict, such 
endangerment is seen as de facto given, and refuge may be granted to all “property 
unlawfully removed from Syria on or after March 15, 2011,” which was the official 
date of the beginning of the Syrian civil war.46 Under the import restriction, no 
archaeological or ethnological material from Syria may be imported unless (1) Syria 
issues a certification or other documentation that certifies that the exportation is 
not in violation of the laws of Syria or (2), in the absence of such documentation, 
satisfactory evidence is provided that the material was exported from Syria not less 
than 10 years before the date of such entry and that neither the person on whose 
account the material is imported (or any related person) has contracted for, or 
acquired an interest in, the material more than one year before the date of entry 
into the United States.47

Armed Conflict and Disasters

In line with the ILA Guidelines,48 in both Switzerland and France, the endanger-
ment must be the result of an armed conflict or a catastrophe (or an emergency).49 
The term “armed conflict” encompasses both international and non-international 
conflicts and, hence, not only declared wars between two or more countries but 
also other armed conflicts without recognition as a state of war.50 Since safe havens 
implement the international assistance efforts of the Second Protocol to the Hague 
Convention, it seems that the dichotomy between armed conflicts, on the one 
hand, and internal unrest and tensions (which are not, therefore, within the scope 
of the Swiss and French laws), on the other hand, should also apply.51

The revision of the Swiss rules in 2015 aimed at an adaptation toward today’s 
danger and threat situation, therefore, extending its scope of application to disasters  

43PCPA, Art. 2 lit. c; Code du patrimoine, Art. L. 111-11, respectively. Similarly, see ILA Guidelines, 
Art. 2, requires that the cultural material is “endangered.”

and emergencies, whereas, as discussed earlier, France took over the notion of disas-
ters only.52 According to the Swiss Federal Council, a catastrophe is an event whose 
implications overstrain the personal and material means of the community con-
cerned and, therefore, requires external support. On the contrary, an emergency is 
not characterized by a single event but, rather, by a development of events that leads 
to the state of necessity of external support mentioned earlier.53 In France, the term 
“catastrophe” should be interpreted broadly, considering the protective aims of the 
law, and, consequently, also cover what Switzerland defines as disaster and emergency 
(since the notion of an emergency is part of the definition of threat). Despite the fact 
that the Swiss message of the Federal Council only refers to natural disasters, we are 
of the opinion that man-made disasters should also be subsumed under the term.54

Requesting Entity
Under the Swiss model, it is not entirely clear whether a safe haven may only be 
granted  upon  request  by  a  foreign  state  owning  or  possessing  the  respective 
cultural good in danger or also upon request by a non-state owner or possessor (or 
even upon determination by the Swiss state itself), since the wording of the clause 
contains no information thereto.55 On the contrary, the French model is clear in 
this sense. A safe haven may only be granted upon request of the foreign state 
owning or possessing the cultural good or upon a respective resolution by the UN 
Security Council.56

An opposite approach is followed by the United States’s Syrian-adapted model, 
where safe havens may only be granted upon request of the foreign (non-state) 
owner or lawful custodian of the good in danger. Furthermore, in the case where 
no owner or lawful custodian can reasonably be identified, the president of the 
United States may determine whether a safe haven should be granted.57

Conclusion of a (State) Treaty with the Source State

State Treaty

In France, the conclusion of a state treaty is required unless a respective resolution 
by the UN Security Council is in existence.58 Even though the second paragraph

possessor; for a detailed assessment, see Paumgartner and Zingg 2014, 1378.

58Although not explicitly mentioned, this may deviate from the fact that only states may request a 
safe haven and, therefore, a respective treaty between the requesting state and the French state must 
always be concluded in one form or another.

of Article 12 of the PCPA contains a detailed list of what should be included in a 
respective state treaty, it is not entirely clear whether the provision of safe havens 
in Switzerland requires the conclusion of a state treaty with the source state.59 The 
question is linked with that regarding who may request the granting of safe havens. 
In this context, it remains questionable whether, for instance, a group of insur-
gents or belligerents, who does not have legal personality,60 have the legal capacity 
to enter into a treaty with Switzerland regarding the protection of endangered 
cultural material under a safe haven61 or if a non-treaty-based safe haven may be 
granted. In the United States, on the other hand, where the provision of a safe 
haven constitutes a waiver of import restrictions for goods imported from Syria, 
no state treaty is required.62

UN Security Council

As outlined above, an innovative approach to combat these issues was introduced 
in France by leaving the French government the possibility of granting a safe haven, 
irrespective of any approval of the source state, when a resolution of the UN Security 
Council is taken in this respect.63

Treaty Conditions

Article 12, paragraph 2, of the PCPA contains a detailed list of what should be 
included in the state treaty between Switzerland and the source state,64 whereas the 
French provisions currently remain silent in this regard.65 The conclusion of the 
treaty may, in theory, be oral and is not subject to any formal requirements, but the 
written form will most probably be the rule, even in the course of time-restricted 
procedures.66 France could eventually follow Switzerland’s decision that foresees 
the drafting of a model safe haven treaty in order that the Federal Council may react 
promptly to potential requests.67

59PCPA, Art. 12, stipulates that the Federal Council “can” enter into state treaties.
60Dinstein 2014, 65.
61When a state recognizes insurgents or belligerents, the latter are provided with a legal personality of 
functionally limited nature, which encompasses the capacity to enter into agreements regarding the 
protection of persons. In regard to the Swiss model and the open wording of the PCPA, Art. 12, it can, 
in our view, be deduced in analogy that insurgents or belligerents recognized by the Swiss state have 
the legal capacity to enter into treaties regarding the protection of cultural property. See Paumgartner 
and Zingg 2014, 1378.

No Contribution to Illegal Trafficking or Financing of Criminal or Terrorist 
Activities
In order to fight the abuse of safe havens, under the US model, there should not be 
any credible evidence that granting the waiver will contribute to illegal trafficking 
in cultural goods from Syria or to the financing of criminal or terrorist activities. 
Though not explicitly mentioned in the respective provisions, we expect that this 
also applies to the Swiss and French model. The same caveat was already identified 
in the ILA Guidelines.68

The Provision of Safe Havens

Authority to Grant Safe Havens
The power to decide upon the granting of a safe haven lies with the executive 
authorities in all three jurisdictions—that is, the Federal Council in Switzerland, 
the Ministre des Affaires étrangères in France, and the president in the United 
States.69 In order to grant the waiver, the president of the United States must certify 
to the congressional committees that the respective conditions (described above) 
for the granting of such are fulfilled.70

Places of Refuge
Safe havens should generally be characterized as protected facilities offered by the 
countries with climatic, security, and technical conditions to guarantee state-of-
the-art safekeeping.71 Illustratively, Switzerland has already determined a (secretly 
kept) refuge near Affoltern in the Canton of Zurich.72 Similarly, the French state 
will make available secured premises. It remains to be seen whether this will also 
happen in advance or only upon the individual requests for the granting of safe 
havens, whereas François Holland in his former role as president of the French 
Republic indicated that the Centre de réserves du Louvre in Liévin could become 
a safe haven.73 In the United States, the facilities of the US government or of a 
cultural or educational institution would be used.74

Collaboration with UNESCO
The pivotal role of UNESCO is underlined by the requirement that the safe-
keeping of the cultural material in Switzerland has to occur under the patronage of 
UNESCO and that, in France, UNESCO has to be informed about the provision of 
the safe haven.75 In the past, the ILA Guidelines had already urged countries to ask 
UNESCO and other international organizations, such as the International Council 
of Museums and the International Council on Monuments and Sites, for assistance 
and advice.76 On the contrary, there is no such rule under the laws of the United 
States.

Fiduciary Custody
Under Swiss law, the cultural material has to be deposited under “fiduciary cus-
tody,” which (pursuant to Swiss law) requires that all protective measures are taken 
according to the state of the art (Fachkunst) and in the exclusive interest of the 
bailor.77 The further details of the obligations of Switzerland of such custody are 
to be specified in the respective treaty regulating the safe haven.78 Under the new 
Article L111-11 of the Code du patrimoine, there is no such mention concerning 
how the deposit shall be handled; the obligations of the custodian, therefore, are 
either to be negotiated bilaterally between the French state and the source state or 
formalized in the ordinance still to be passed. Similarly, the US laws stipulate that 
the material is held in custody without further specifying the details. Detailed 
exemplary rules on the safekeeping and preserving of the cultural goods can be 
found in Article 4 of the ILA Guidelines.

Use of the Cultural Property
Under the Swiss model, the underlying treaty must contain the conditions and 
modalities of the exhibition or study of the cultural material.79 On the contrary, the 
Swiss laws do not foresee the possibility of exhibiting the material in the absence of 
such an agreement. According to the French model, loans may be granted, upon the 
explicit consent of the source state, in order to circulate the material for exhibition 
with the purpose of making known that such material is in danger. The material, 
therefore, may also leave French territory under the condition that the state where 
the exhibition is taking place grants immunity from the seizure of the respective 
material.80 In the United States, a set of uses, such as restoration, conservation,

study, or exhibition without profit, are foreseen,81 but it is not regulated whether 
or not the consent of the owner or the rightful custodian is required. Other forms 
of use, such as the private loan of cultural material or the exploitation of rights—
for instance, by photographic reproduction—shall, in principle, be forbidden.82

Immunity from Seizure
Immunity from seizure is granted to any material protected under safe haven in 
all three jurisdictions.83 This mechanism creates ex ante incentives for the source 
state—respectively, the non-state owner or possessor—to transfer the cultural 
good(s) to the safe haven since claims by third parties will not be considered by 
courts in the safe haven country during the safekeeping period.

Import Restrictions
Customs and tax provisions are triggered by the entry of movable cultural goods 
with the aim of deposit.84 In Switzerland, the Federal Council has proposed using 
a simplified warehousing procedure since the goods are not brought, distributed, 
or used in another context.85 It remains to be seen whether a simplified import 
procedure may be available for safe haven goods in France.86

Return of Cultural Property
Safe  havens  are  limited  in  time  by  their  very  nature.  The  French  laws  stipulate 
that the state shall return the goods after the end of the situation that caused their 
safekeeping or at any moment upon a respective request of the source state. The 
conditions and modalities of return for Switzerland must be regulated in the un-
derlying treaty. In the United States, the material must be returned to the owner or 
lawful custodian at any time it is requested, irrespective of whether the Syrian civil 
war has ended or not.87

Costs
The Swiss Federal Council estimates that the yearly costs that will be incurred for the 
Swiss state in connection with safe havens (mainly for material and personnel) will 
be approximately 50,000 to 100,000 Swiss francs, whereas the exact cost allocation

between the depositor and the Swiss state for each safe haven transfer is to be 
agreed upon in the underlying treaty.88 The laws of France and the United States, 
on the contrary, do not specify details on the cost distribution. In that regard, the 
ILA Guidelines argue that based on fairness and on the importance to overcome 
financial reluctances, the source state is expected, in principle, to provide compen-
sation for reasonable expenses.89 Regarding the eventual revenues flowing from the 
protected good(s), we recommend that the parties agree that the safe haven state 
is entitled to use those for the maintenance and financing of the places of refuge.90

SAFE HAVENS ON A MUSEUM LEVEL

As a result of the limitations of the first draft of the Protect and Preserve Interna-
tional Cultural Property Act, the AAMD has issued a set of ethical guidelines—
the so-called AAMD Protocols for Safe Havens for Works of Cultural Significance 
from Countries in Crisis (AAMD Protocols)—for the provision of safe havens by 
museums.91 The AAMD Protocols therefore build upon an established practice in 
the field of cultural heritage and museum management, where self-regulation and 
the observation of extensive ethical codes have complemented (incomplete) legal 
standards.92 Most famously, this is illustrated in the return of World War II era art 
confiscated by the Nazis93 or in the museum acquisition process.94

Similar to the Swiss and the French rules, the AAMD Protocols apply to works 
in danger as a result of war, terrorism, and natural disasters. Under the protocols, 
however, assistance in the form of a safe haven may be requested by any depositor 
(that is, by state and non-state entities) of the works in danger and only require that 
the request is made in compliance with applicable laws (that is, not violating the 
rights of lawful owners). The AAMD Protocols list, inter alia, museums in the area 
affected that hold works, governmental entities of or within the areas affected, US 
government authorities who have seized works, or private individuals, companies, 
or organizations that own, or have come into possession of, works as examples of 
depositors that may request the granting of a safe haven from a member museum.95
According to the AAMD Protocols, the works should be returned depending only 
on the circumstances existing in the source country and, therefore, in our opinion,

nance and financing of safe havens. See also ILA Guidelines, Guideline 4, with such provision.

only when the situation that gave rise to the need for a safe haven has passed. In 
between, the objects will be treated as loans96 and published on the AAMD object 
registry.97 In addition, it is recommended that the inventorying and documenting 
of the objects should take place in the country of origin and that a new condition 
report should be prepared upon their arrival.98 Works should be transported by 
the safest and surest method to the closest safe haven possible, whereas the depos-
itor shall bear the respective costs unless otherwise agreed. Subsequently, the works 
should be stored under conditions that are suitable and consistent with the security, 
climate, and storage protocols of the respective museum. The works may only be 
exhibited when appropriate and with the permission of the depositor. Similarly, 
conservation should only be undertaken with the consent of the depositor, unless 
there is an emergency.

Since the AAMD is aware of the potential legal issues that circumvent the granting 
of safe havens on a non-state level, the AAMD Protocols contain several precau-
tionary provisions and recommendations in this regard. Accordingly, museums 
are advised to exercise caution in assuring that the granting of the safe haven will 
not violate the rights of lawful owners99 and that the return of the objects is in 
compliance  with  applicable  laws.  Requests  for  safe  haven  and  agreements  to 
accept  should  be  documented.  Furthermore,  the  protocols  recommend  that  the 
museum should examine whether legal protections, such as immunity from seizure, 
are available in the safe haven state before accepting the works.100 Referring to the 
complexity of the legal issues, institutions are advised to consult with legal counsel 
before accepting or returning the objects.

ASSESSMENT OF THE MODELS

Switzerland

The Swiss model is characterized by provisions that are fairly broad, leaving the 
executive authorities a lot of space for individual tailor-made solutions in order 
to grant adequate protection to endangered cultural property. As with any other 
broad clause, this is naturally accompanied by several uncertainties. It is highly 
uncertain and thus remains to be seen whether a safe haven in Switzerland may be 
requested only by the foreign source state and whether a state treaty is required. 
Should that be the case, we think that the Swiss model is too restrictive and not 
adequately suited to the pitfalls of the protection of cultural property during armed 
conflicts. It is notable that the acceptance of works without the explicit consent of

NIKOLAUS THADDÄUS PAUMGARTNER AND RAPHAEL ZINGG

the source state could lead to several legal and diplomatic uncertainties. In order 
to avoid these situations, Switzerland would have to undertake complex legal 
clarifications, especially regarding whether the cultural property has been lawfully 
removed from the source state. Otherwise, Switzerland would risk, inter alia, being 
accused of having breached international treaties and of supporting the illicit plun-
dering of cultural heritage.

The Swiss model does not provide for protective measures regarding the export 
of the endangered cultural objects from the conflicted area to Switzerland. Despite 
the  fact  that  the  transport  may  be  regulated  in  the  treaty,  the  depositor  is  left 
with the highest hurdle when seeking to receive protection abroad. We are of the 
opinion that safe haven states should also try to account actively for this problem 
area. Room for respective actions becomes particularly small when a safe haven 
is requested by a non-state entity, given that any measures taken by Switzerland in 
the absence of the consent of the source state would potentially interfere with the 
source state’s sovereignty. Nevertheless, the safe haven state could seek collaboration 
with international organizations, such as the UN.

The broad definition of cultural property is clearly advantageous as it covers all 
types of cultural material. The Swiss provision accounts properly for today’s risk 
situation by covering external and internal armed conflicts. As a first Safe Haven has 
already been determined in Switzerland, we welcome the fact that Swiss authorities 
are demonstratively prepared to react promptly to requests. As mentioned above, 
a model state treaty will also be drafted; a task to which particular attention shall be 
drawn, as a detailed regulation would enable certain uncertainties to be overcome. 
One point that should be regulated in greater detail is the return of the object in 
order to overcome possible problems that might arise, for example, in cases where 
the conflict ends earlier or later than anticipated under the treaty or in the case where 
the state entity with which the treaty was concluded no longer exists.

The Swiss model ensures that measures are taken in accordance with interna-
tional expert organizations by requiring that the provision of safe haven must 
occur under the patronage of UNESCO. The Swiss legislature has also reacted to 
the urge to grant immunity from seizure to the cultural material in storage. Lastly, 
one should remember that the Swiss model has played a pioneer role in this matter, 
driving other states to enact similar legislation based thereon.

France

Aspects of the French legislation point to the Swiss model as an example but expand 
on existing principles. The result is more detailed and clear provisions that, how-
ever, also contain shortfalls with regard to the vast protection of cultural property 
in danger. The respective ordinance that is to be passed by the Conseil d’État will 
potentially bring further clarifications. The central shortfall of the French model 
is that the provision of a safe haven by the French state may only be requested by 
the source state of the cultural objects in danger. This is highly problematic in the

case where the government requesting a safe haven is not accepted by the interna-
tional community, the state itself is not recognized by France, or where a non-state 
owner of cultural property (for example, a private owner or non-state museum) 
wishes custody of works in a safe haven, but the source state does not. Even though 
enabling non-state entities to request safe havens leads to several legal and diplo-
matic uncertainties (particularly in the absence of the source state’s consent101), 
we believe that this is essential in order to account adequately for the dynamics of 
today’s armed conflicts.

The only possibility to overcome this deadlock situation under the French system 
is a respective resolution by the UN Security Council. Although such a resolution 
would be an innovative and clearly useful approach that would improve possible 
protection and that, at the same time, would express the value of safe havens as 
an instrument of international peace and security, it is questionable whether a 
resolution would be taken against a source country’s explicit dissent or whether a 
resolution may always be taken in due time and prior to the danger having mani-
fested itself. Of a primarily symbolic nature, the willingness of the French state to 
collaborate internationally in this field is further marked by the legal obligation to 
inform UNESCO about the granting of a safe haven.

In addition thereto, the fact that the property has to be returned at any time 
upon request of the source state is to be criticized, especially since cultural property 
may still be at risk when a respective request for return is placed. The French model 
also currently provides no answer as to whether and to whom the cultural goods 
shall be returned in case the owner or possessor no longer exists or has changed 
since the safe haven was granted. A recent case in the Netherlands has shown that 
such uncertainty may restrain the state in which the goods are temporarily located 
from returning such goods. The Netherlands “handed back” 69 looted artifacts to 
Iraq in 2009. In fact, the items could only be symbolically returned to the Iraqi 
ambassador in the Netherlands and will be exhibited in the Dutch National Museum 
for Antiquities until they can be safely returned to the Iraqi National Museum 
in Bagdad.102 Another prominent example of the problems that can arise was the 
storage of certain Polish art treasures in Canada during World War II. With the 
change of the Polish government leading to various complications vis-à-vis the 
Canadian authorities, among many other issues, it took the new Polish government 
from 1945 until 1960 to re-obtain possession of all of the treasures.103

The French model, which is similar to the Swiss model, does not contain any 
measures regarding the export of the goods from the conflicted areas to French 
territory. Whilst immunity from seizure is granted, it remains to be seen how 

101This raises the same comments as those mentioned above.

custody will occur—that is, since there is no mention with regard to its fiduciary. 
Therefore, it is desirable that questions such as these will be regulated under the 
ordinance. What is clearly advantageous regarding the French model is the fact 
that the definition of cultural property is the broadest among the three models, 
enabling for the protection of a wide range of cultural goods without undergoing 
problems of qualification. The French model adequately covers the main threats 
of cultural property today (that is, all types of armed conflict and natural catastro-
phes). The legal anchoring of the possibility of displaying the cultural objects in  
national  and  international  exhibitions  should  be  considered  primarily  advanta-
geous, particularly since this action enables the awareness of the endangerment 
of the cultural objects to be raised. However, caution must be taken in case the 
ownership of the works is unclear since false impressions can be created by display-
ing illegally acquired and/or imported goods as goods that have been rightfully 
acquired and imported.

United States

When assessing the US model, it should be taken into account that it works as a 
waiver to certain import restrictions that would otherwise prohibit the import of 
certain goods from Syria. As it only applies to a very limited set of cases, the model 
cannot be examined from the same perspective as the Swiss and French models. 
Overall, however, we are of the opinion that it represents a relatively flexible 
exemption solution regime and that the principle of safe havens at an individual 
state level should be further explored. In particular, a highly democratic legiti-
mation within the safe haven state is ensured, which, in our view, is particularly 
important with respect to the granting of safe havens without the source state’s 
(explicit) consent. The requirement that there must be no credible evidence that 
granting the waiver will contribute to illegal trafficking or financing of criminal or 
terrorist activities additionally lowers the risk of abuse of the protection measures, 
particularly if the works are exhibited.

As outlined above, the definition of cultural property to which a safe haven 
may be granted under the US model is relatively narrow. Goods that do not fall 
under the definition are not subject to the import restriction and may be imported 
(all other conditions fulfilled) and be granted protection in the United States.104 
Through the requirement that the request for protection has to be made by the 
lawful owner or custodian, the US model reacts adequately to the situation in Syria 
and the pitfalls of cultural property endangered in zones of conflict. Practical issues 
might yet arise with regard to proof of ownership or the lawfulness of the custody. 
In order to mitigate this problem, the president of the United States is granted the 
power to decide upon a safe haven in case no owner or lawful custodian can be 
reasonably identified.

THE RISE OF SAFE HAVENS FOR THREATENED CULTURAL HERITAGE 

343

As under the French model, the objects may be exhibited, in which case, inter-
estingly, custody transfers to the respective institution in the United States. Similar 
to the other two countries, the United States has addressed the central need of 
granting immunity from seizure to the stored cultural material. Finally, as with 
the French model, a point to criticize is that the objects must be returned anytime 
upon an owner’s or a custodian’s request and that certain modalities of return are 
not regulated. A further issue lies in the fact that the power to make such decisions 
lies with the president, who must certify to the appropriate congressional commit-
tees considering that a decision on this level of democratic legitimacy may not be 
taken in due time.

AAMD

The  AAMD  Protocols  demonstrate  a  remarkable  private  initiative.  With  its  
current  network  of  242  member  museums  across  Mexico,  Canada,  and  the 
United  States,  potential  depositors  may  not  only  select  the  country  but  also 
the  museum  and,  therefore,  the  most  suitable  conditions  for  storage  of  the 
respective  endangered  cultural  objects.  The  protocols  are  exemplary  for  the  
introduction  of  codes  of  ethics  and  self-regulation  by  museums  and  other  
actors in the field of art due to ethical considerations. Scholars widely acknowl-
edge  the  positive  impacts  such  ethical  codes  can  have,  supplementing  or 
substituting incomplete legal norms.105 Given that the AAMD Protocols do not 
limit the entities that may request a safe haven to states, the problems that are 
discussed above do not arise. In addition, since the objects should be returned 
depending only on the circumstances, we believe that a higher degree of pro-
tection may be reached.

Although the AAMD Protocols address the handling of legal risks repeatedly, 
the central shortfalls of the model on a museum level are the legal uncertainties 
that may impede this development. Determining the origin of the work in order to 
avoid accepting illegal artifacts with false provenance106 and identifying the rightful 
owner may be particularly challenging, especially under time constraints. A mu-
seum also needs to ascertain that the object was not unlawfully removed from its 
source state, which is a problem that is further exacerbated by the fact that safe 
havens may also be requested by private individuals and, therefore, without the 
consent of the source state. Museums are thus confronted with the strong risk of 
complex  legal  disputes,  fines,  and  high  financial  and  reputational  damages.  The 
protocols  recommend  that  museums  consult  legal  counsel  before  accepting  or 
returning  any  works.  In  addition  to  being  costly,  the  determination  of  the  legal 
framework of the ownership and the conditions of the return in special situations

may also become extremely complicated and time consuming to clarify for legal 
experts.107

A recent case in Switzerland (as mentioned above) may illustrate the complexity 
and challenges of safe havens at the museum level. The Musée d’art et d’histoire 
in Geneva had exhibited a collection of 530 pieces belonging to the Palestinian 
National Authority and the collector Jawdat Khoudary in its exhibition Gaza à la 
croisée des civilisations in April 2007. After Hamas took power in Palestine in June 
2007, the works could not be returned due to the political insecurity that followed. 
The city of Geneva then accepted custody of the works, but several issues followed. 
Because  the  goods  had  transited  partly  via  Alexandria  and  partly  via  Tel-Aviv,  
custom-related issues prevented the cultural goods from being returned.108 In 
addition,  the  city  of  Geneva  could  not  discuss  the  case  with  the  Palestinian 
National Authority for several years. Ultimately, the city of Geneva had to request 
federal funding to cover the yearly costs of 35,000 Swiss francs for the works’ deposit 
in the Geneva Freeport.109 The transport of the collection to the Palestinian Museum, 
near Ramallah, was planned for 2017.110

We believe that safe havens for objects with a complex legal background may be 
granted by museums only in collaboration with the safe haven state. The AAMD Pro-
tocols also eventually recommend that the museums should consider whether legal 
protection, such as immunity from seizure, is available to protect the object and the 
museum from claims. Since the objects may be deposited in museums under the US 
model, this model works as an example for such museum–state cooperation.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In light of the current systematic destruction and looting of cultural heritage, the world 
faces immense challenges in preserving cultural sites and artifacts in conflict zones. In 
this respect, we think that the establishment of places of refuge abroad may, in theory, 
contribute largely to the rescue of endangered relics. Though the possible measures for 
protecting cultural material on site in the conflicted areas are manifold and potentially 
of great impact, such protective actions must always be weighed against other prior-
ities, such as preventing attacks on civilians or protecting key infrastructure.111

THE RISE OF SAFE HAVENS FOR THREATENED CULTURAL HERITAGE 

345

Safe havens, on the contrary, have the potential to isolate movable cultural goods 
from imminent or ongoing conflicts and to keep them safe until the conflict has 
ended. However, the challenge that safe haven states will often face is that of moving 
from a symbolic measure to an instrument with practical impact. When consid-
ering how fast conflicts may spread, one realizes that there may be little time in the 
early period of a crisis to export works threatened by the imploding violence.112 At 
later stages, the geopolitical situation may prevent the conflicted state from making 
use of the possibility of requesting a safe haven abroad, as currently evidenced by 
Syria. Simultaneously, and particularly in the absence of the consent of the source 
state,  it  may  become  extremely  difficult  for non-state entities to export endan-
gered cultural objects from conflicted areas without any external support.

As outlined herein, each of the four models has different advantages and disad-
vantages regarding the challenges inherent with the granting of safe havens, despite 
the fact that, to our knowledge, neither the Swiss, the French, nor the AAMD safe 
haven models have been used so far.113 Our recommendations to strengthen the 
effectiveness and potential impact of safe havens are sevenfold. First, as the granting  
of safe havens under consent of the source state is clearly beneficial, safe haven states 
must engage in diplomatic proactive efforts and flexibility to create incentives for 
third countries to make use of safe havens. Second, safe haven states should put a 
high value on the safeguard of mankind’s heritage and, thus, be open when negoti-
ating the cost allocation in order to counter the eventual lack of financial means of 
source states. Additionally and ideally, safe haven states should, inter alia, by way of 
collaboration with international organizations, such as the UN, foresee measures 
for the export and transportation of the cultural goods from the source state to the 
safe haven state. This is particularly important in the case of requests by non-state 
depositors. Third, the treaty regulating the safe haven should address issues such as 
the transfer and return of the cultural property clearly, also foreseeing unexpected 
legal, factual, and political changes. Fourth, we recommend that future safe haven 
states account better for the potential impact of a crisis in the law, such as a change 
of regime or failed states. Fifth, goods should only be returned once the conflict 
has ended. Sixth and despite the diplomatic and legal issues, we argue that the 
effectiveness and use of safe havens should be reinforced through the acceptance 
of deposits by non-state actors. Finally, we are of the opinion that states should 
support private non-state initiatives, such as that by the AAMD, particularly by 
providing them with legal protection measures.

112One recent example is the Arabic Spring, where Hosni Moubarak resigned from the presidency 
of Egypt only 18 days after the first protests in Tahrir Square or where Zine El Abidine Ben-Ali was 
ousted within one month.
