Latin American and Spanish Copyright
Relations (1880–1904)

In this article, an attempt is made to capture experiences embodied through bilateral copyright
relationships between Latin America and Spain (1884–1904). Special attention is devoted to issues
bracketed off in traditional historical narratives, such as the always-decisive intervention of a
suitable time to act and the techniques by which political relations outside the Berne Convention
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Property 1886 were established. In doing so, attempts
are made to describe the practices in carrying out negotiations and to follow the simultaneous
emergence of problems interwoven in those political practices. The main aim is to try to
appreciate abilities to establish contacts and to frame different themes, prioritizing and singular-
izing issues, furnishing trust and helping to construct horizons in bilateral copyright relations.

Keywords Berne Convention; South America

As copyright historiography has thoroughly explored, the multilateral copyright
negotiations that gave birth to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Property 1886 (the Berne Convention) involved a speciﬁc mode of
gathering and communicating determined in diverse and particular protocols (Rick-
etson, 1987, pp. 81–125). An important issue to consider when staging a history of
international copyright running through those two formative decades (1880–1900) is
that, at that precise moment, the life and fate of the Berne Convention was
unpredictable.1 Better said, its value as the model for international copyright was at
risk for many reasons. Uncertainty and hesitation about the future were concomitant
to the venture. While the openness of the text initially signed at Berne and, more
precisely, the procedural future ﬁnally absorbed some of those uncertainties,2
simultaneous ways of imagining international copyright overlapped that model and
those protocols. An exploration of the ways through which that second framework
emerged is of greater interest in this article, which focuses on the co-existence of a
speciﬁc type of concurrent relations, perceived then as international, that has attracted
little attention in copyright historiography: the making of bilateral copyright negotia-
tions; in other words, processes of relating and attaching to copyright between nations
that simultaneously emerged on both sides of the Atlantic in those formative decades
of international copyright. In pursuing this prospect, the diplomatic channels opened
between Latin American countries and Spain are speciﬁcally explored.

Peripheries in the Centre

By whim of history, this period of international formation of copyright simulta-
neously gave birth to a series of copyright bilateral relations that evolved between

Latin American and European countries.3 The prominent, ‘‘nervous’’, skilled and
talented Jose Mar ´ıa Torres Caicedo appeared at the centre of these initial commu-
nicative inputs.4 Torres Caicedo was a Colombian journalist and a cosmopolitan
writer,5 and an audacious ‘‘overall’’ Latin American diplomat,6 with speciﬁc desires
for Latin American political uniﬁcation.7 He was also—and surprisingly—a copy-
right scholar (Torres Caicedo, 1875; 1879). At that time, he was described as the
mentor to Latin Americans visiting Paris, an extremely ‘‘talented politician who
worked as hard as you can imagine’’,8 someone who coined the term ‘‘Latin
America’’ as opposed to ‘‘North America’’.9 His investment in that particular
representation of the world would be crucial because it became an image naturally
shared by a substantial number of politicians and intellectuals. That distinction
between Latin America ‘‘as such’’ and North America grounded a possibility of
establishing distinct relationships between Europe and Latin America. Indeed, it
was an image that shaped a set of issues that this article is attempting to describe.10
At this particular political moment, Latin America emerged as a speciﬁc historical
‘‘object’’ in which to think and to make history,11 that is, an ‘‘imagined community’’
from where narratives could spring (Anderson, 1983, p. 204). To understand how so
many bilateral copyright relationships were attempted in such a short time is to
rediscover that dream again.

Nevertheless, and to continue with Torres Caicedo, there is still a salient feature
in that biography for us to highlight. He was not only a copyright scholar. He
became president of the most inﬂuential copyright association of that time, the
Association Litt ´eraire et Artistique Internationale (ALAI).12 Taking into account his
crucial presence in a sequence of events that we all know such as, for instance, the
well-known support from the Swiss Federal Council in organizing an international
copyright congress (Ricketson, 1987, p. 49; Rivarola, 1904, p. 46),
it is now
extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd an explanation that could clarify why Latin American
countries did not ﬁnally appear among the countries that signed the Berne
Convention. If Torres Caicedo was the president of ALAI at that precise moment,
how is this absence to be explained? It might be interesting to highlight the fact that
bilateral copyright contacts between Latin American and European countries
started a few years before the 1883 ALAI conference.13 While being initiated in
the early 1880s, diplomatic communications concerning copyright relations sud-
denly overlapped the conferences that ﬁnally led to the Berne Convention. This
simultaneity shows an active strategy of diverse, punctual, recurrent copyright
interventions being followed on both sides of the Atlantic. And it also pinpoints that
the Berne Convention was not an inevitable outcome but an event that was involved
in a set of circumstances, occasions and contingencies (Bently and Sherman, 2001).
Carrying a wide plenipotentiary,14 Torres Caicedo led successful bilateral
copyright negotiations between France and El Salvador15 and between Spain and
El Salvador.16 While those conventions also became key models for the drafting
of a text to be negotiated at Berne, it is important to note their exact timing.
Institutional memories of international copyright have usually depicted bilateralism

as a pre-stage to the Berne Convention, while here a tendency for bilateralism was
not exactly preliminary. Indeed, a ‘‘second’’ wave of bilateral engagements was a
phenomenon that appeared to emerge simultaneously (1880–1904) with the succes-
sive formulation of conferences and revisions of the Berne Convention (1886–1908),
that is, within the creative formation of the international forum.17 The immediacy
of that experience was unexpected. Nowhere was this truer than in El Salvador.
That country was honoured with a bilateral copyright agreement even before
having enacted its own domestic positive copyright law (Gonza´ lez Hontoria,
1899, p. 9).

Conversion of Interests
Despite those initial efforts of Torres Caicedo, the main position shared by Latin
American diplomats at the beginning of the decade (1880) was a general reluctance
to foster a universal experience of copyright (Quesada, 1904, pp. 183–8). It was not
the right moment. Many risks had to be assessed, and legislative frictions were
rising: substantial changes had to be carried out. If those troubles were not enough,
international agreements as they were being drawn up were not perceived as
encompassing salient features from which to extract beneﬁts of any kind to the
countries they were representing.18 However, a transformation of those perceptions
can be seen in descriptions of piracy given by the same reluctant diplomats just one
decade later.19 Little by little a story of enthusiastic arguments and counter-
arguments for those actions of engagements popped up. And that transformation
of the space for discussion opened up the possibility of ‘‘thinking’’ international
copyright locally. A crucial role in that transformation came in the isolation of a
problem within negotiations of bilateral copyright agreements. From his domicile in
Paris, Torres Caicedo began to draw up a landscape of point-for-point ad hoc
bilateral copyright relations between Latin American countries and several Eur-
opean countries, particularly France and Spain.20 Through that process of minia-
turization and ‘‘vigorous’’ political action,21 what seems interesting is that Torres
Caicedo, in his ‘‘discovery’’ of Latin America poetry and literature,22 formally
highlighted one ‘‘matter of concern’’ that united all Latin American countries: the
difﬁcult birth of their national
indications of distinctive
national literatures that were barely known in Europe were crucial in detecting
and articulating images of piracy as a bottleneck obstructing their birth. This
reﬂection—an epitome of an inspiring way of framing an argument—became a
motto in the engineering of a system of relations.24 Continuing such a thematiza-
tion, a possible link could be forged between the purpose of bilateral copyright
relations and the diverse and speciﬁc interests of Latin American countries.25 This
link stemmed from different observations and diverse administrative needs.

literatures.23 In fact,

A difﬁcult birth, then, ‘‘proven by statistics’’,26 now had a plausible explanation
and a test for its capability. It was not surprising that ‘‘when piracy was de facto
tolerated, foreign books were used and abused as if they were ‘‘bienes nostrencos’’
(vacant goods)’’ (Quesada, 1904, p. 29). When exploring the difﬁculties of writing

r  r 3

Jose Bellido

Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

and publishing in Latin America,27 it was automatically concluded that ‘‘having
that free resource, publishers or booksellers did not pay attention to national
writers; they neither had to pay for their productions nor even to print them . . .
because it was more lucrative to sell what was coming from outside’’ (Quesada,
1904, p. 29). This belief in copyright as a beneﬁcial instrument indeed led to some
discussions about the enactment or modiﬁcation of national copyright statutes in
Latin America (Groussac, 1896, pp. 9–33 and 161–93; Caro’s speech in Colombia,
18 May 1886 in Cruz Santos, 1983, pp. 121–5). Distinctive authorship was
simultaneously related to a new section just created in academic or university
programmes (Oyuela, 1884).28 Social and individual means were supposedly going
to be harmonized when copyright could be imagined as an instrument that could
enhance and foster the production of national literatures. Second, a concomitant
attempt tied to those reﬂections centred on the sense that some arrangements in
international copyright could serve to avoid the traditional pilgrimage of Latin
American writers to Europe or the United States to ﬁnd a publisher. To indicate the
focus of those visions and their impact even today, we may observe how current
Latin American historiographies of copyright ﬁx their point of origin on several
episodes of litigation concerning what are also considered to be the ‘‘foundational’’
works of their national literatures.29 What seems to be an underlying theme of
literary history coupled to these visions of piracy in Latin America was paradoxi-
cally the development of new meanings that were sensitively considering copyright
as a community-building device. That is, throughout these last decades of the
nineteenth century, we can perceive an emergence of a series of claims expressing a
belief that bilateral relations in copyright were an ‘‘indispensable’’ mechanism with
which to facilitate incipient Latin American literatures their ‘‘rightful’’ place in
society, thereby promoting ‘‘social stability’’.30

Data Points in International Copyright
It was not long before that persuasive connection between copyright and nation
building began to display an increasingly explanatory potential (Carilla, 1989,
p. 367). It only needed to become attached to expectations for national literatures to
emerge where copyright was supposedly to serve as an impulse.31 As a potential for
that catalyst, there was a repertoire of actions opened and viewpoints that could be
constructed. Discussions were at stake displaying different scenarios for the
construction of a legal operative formula that could situate viewpoints in interna-
tional copyright. A concept denoting recipient of rights,
in its
international dimension, could be moulded and sculpted using different factors
generated by diverse data points. ‘‘Domicile’’, ‘‘nationality’’, ‘‘citizenship’’ and
‘‘place of publication’’ were among the alternatives that could be used in order to
construct the reference for applicability of international copyright law. At that
precise moment, copyright experts were discussing how to structure those variables,
how to gather those data points and how they could adapt in an international

‘‘authorship’’

scenario in the making (Da´ nvila in Congreso Jur ´ıdico Ibero-Americano, 1893,
pp. 288–9; Ricketson, 1987, pp. 159–68).32

The normative choice to capture that moment among the combination of
contingent factors was not banal at all.33 While the consequences of such a decision
could not have been foreseen, the potential signiﬁcance of the transformation of
variables into a legal formula lay in their capability for isolating the data points
where international copyright statements could be grounded. The text of the Berne
Convention as it was modiﬁed during its ﬁrst decade (1886 and 1896) had selected
different wordings for that construction. It chose a complex and formidable
composite rule in which those factors were substantially translated to achieve a
complex legal formula. And that drawing had signiﬁcant effects on Latin Amer-
icans.34 Additionally, Latin American countries realized that there were indeed
opportunities to ﬁlter, to translate and to individualize different points generated in
making copyright international. By doing so they could visualize those copyright
bonds differently. And they did. It was not only regional agreements organized by
those countries in which different normative routes and combinations were
attempted,35 prioritizing rules around ‘‘territoriality’’
instead of ‘‘nationality’’;
bilateral copyright agreements also began to be perceived as devices in which
different footings for international copyright could be constructed.

References to US Copyright
The sort of diagnosis that began by conceiving piracy as a social disrupting element
in the construction of a community could also be perceived in the running
commentary made by some Latin American publicists when examining different
events occurring in the copyright arena. These observing tendencies are indeed
interesting because they were produced in a period when to study the state of
the copyright legislation in other countries was becoming increasingly important
(Da´ nvila y Collado, 1882, p. 199, p. 245). Of the related copyright episodes that
were at that precise moment at the forefront, one legislative intricacy was followed
with special interest in both Latin America and Spain.36 That event was the famous
and complex enactment in the United States of a peculiar law, the Chace Act (1891).
This Act represented the North American entry into the ‘‘international’’ copyright
world and became famous for containing a controversial condition upon which that
entry was constituted: the so-called ‘‘manufacturing clause’’ (The Manufacturing
Clause, 1950, pp. 686–99). That condition for protection was the requirement of
simultaneous North American publication and manufacture (Seville, 2006,
pp. 240–8). To most commentators, this legislative enactment was a problematic
international measure put forward by particular North American publishing
interests (Solberg, 1901, pp. 51–4). Some Latin American observers also spotted
how it was going to affect Latin Americans.37 In doing so, they scrutinized the
passage of this act by highlighting their direct beneﬁciaries, that is, the North
American typographical unions and their domestic book industry. For instance,
Calixto Oyuela, an Argentinean copyright and literary scholar (Oyuela, 1888; 1901),

r  r 5

considered that ‘‘it is true that the protection is offered on the basis that the foreign
work is to be printed, simultaneously, in the United States. However, this law
implies a step forward that is the solemn repudiation of previous piracy. Such a
restriction was not established in order to beneﬁt the national culture and to
facilitate the diffusion of foreign books and foreign artistic works but in order to
protect the typographical industry that was very developed there’’ (Caro’s reference
in Cruz Santos, 1986, p. 123; Oyuela in Quesada, 1904, p. 37).

Legal Deposits
Nevertheless, it might be more interesting to turn to the instances whereby some of
those dreams of cultural differentiation materialized. A glance at the associative
networks where these embryonic calls for copyright bilateral attachments emerged
also displayed a crucial synergy that may appear, at least a priori, surprising.
Substantial amounts of work from those ‘‘interested’’ in copyright bilateralism
in Latin America came from individuals and institutions also involved in the
organization of national libraries.38 Institutional organizational activities in Latin
America eagerly sought to establish national collections of books. In so doing, they
required a supply of works from internal and external sources. Literary exchanges
of publications encompassed several background expectations that could be
channelled through bilateral copyright agreements. Interestingly, different under-
standings of reciprocity emerged.39 One way that we can perceive how copyright and
the organization of national libraries came suddenly together is by looking at the
common avenue opened in designing some of those copyright bilateral treaties.
Through those engagements, the chances of including certain clauses referring to
the interchange of books between countries and, speciﬁcally, opportunities of
including material obligations such as the ‘‘legal deposit’’ were controversially
opened. To a certain extent, those promising elements made bilateral engagements
of copyright measures attractive. Latin American governments were indeed im-
mersed in developing their own publishing schemes through their respective
national printing presses; there was also an ongoing preoccupation previously
instantiated in the cabinets’ agendas to foster the entry and circulation of books
in a vast geographic territory.40 For instance, 1884 had already witnessed
an interesting ofﬁcial gathering of four Latin American countries (Argentina,
Colombia, Chile and Uruguay) for the signing of a Convention for the Promotion
and Propagation of Useful Publications.41 This convention was self-conceived as a
‘‘large-scale operation’’ to promote and protect the publication in the Spanish
language of works of notorious utility.42 And those preoccupations and attempts
continued throughout the 1880s and 1890s.43

Bilateral negotiations for copyright then opened up the possibility of aligning
some of these pedagogical desires for both cultural integration and differentiation
that were wrapped up in Latin American governmental agendas.44 Literary
exchanges and deposit of books could be intertwined with bilateral copyright
negotiations to the extent that these agreements could serve as enabling devices

6

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

to feed the catalogues of recently inaugurated institutions such as national
libraries.45 While the history of a device such as the legal deposit could now be
perceived as ‘‘a succession of legislative and normative caprices that rarely affect the
book’’ (Botrel, 1993, p. 302), it was at that time, however, particularly important to
provide a clear grounding within which competing interests could be unobtrusively
accommodated. In the form of a political dream to be fulﬁlled, deposits, registries
and ‘‘lists’’ of works served to tie together copyright and literary exchanges in a
single developmental programme.46 Some Latin American countries succeeded in
including such clauses in bilateral agreements. However, for several reasons, they
began to disappear or to lose force. Indeed, how this political dream suddenly began
to evaporate in legal domains could be seen in several discussions held at the
Spanish Congress.47

Yet the importance of these types of clauses should not be underestimated
because it was an initial impetus for Latin American countries in their desires for
entry into a suitable copyright realm. For instance, it could serve to keep the
concept of public domain within the domestic sphere through ofﬁcial means. That is,
if the requirement upon protection was that of registration or deposit, or if the
requirement upon protection was the publication of notices, there was then a
possibility of barring actions for copyright infringements. There was then an option,
for instance, for those non-inscribed foreign works or works bearing no copyright
notice to be passed directly into the free pool where they could be printed legally
and without restraint.48 The possibility of establishing those prescriptions was
particularly interesting because they reﬂected different ways of understanding the
legal architecture of such a collective device (public domain) that copyright was
based on. While Latin Americans attempted to widen the concept of public domain,
by trying to extend property expiry points in time and scope, Spaniards tried to
narrow it. In the process of negotiating bilateral agreements, several Latin Amer-
ican countries noted with some preoccupation the appearance of editorial practices
that were indeed strategically to have such an affect.49 A copyright bilateral
agreement was then perceived as a suitable means of settling those controversies,
that is, to try to limit those private editorial practices emanating from Spain.50

Opening Files

Precisely at this moment of internationalization of copyright, Spanish experts in
international relations, both politicians and jurists, were making a distinction of
different ways whereby to relate internationally, that is, different forms of pursuing
international relations. On the one hand—they pointed out—‘‘there are scientiﬁc
collective actions’’ (such as the formation of the Berne Convention), and on the
other, an international trend that could be pursued by ‘‘diplomatic actions held by
individual countries’’ (Torres Campos, 1893, p. 311). This is an important distinc-
tion between diplomacy at a conference and diplomacy pursued in the traditional
sense, that is, by missions, envoys and bilateral negotiations. Today we can observe

r  r 7

Jose Bellido

Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

that tension by noticing how the Spanish government did not or could not foresee
how inevitable or crucial the Berne Union was going to become (Silvela, 1892). A
tendency to invest in bilateral negotiations might be derived not only from a failure
to predict the importance of the Berne Union but also from particular contingencies
that occured at that moment and that led to a quest to ﬁnd an alternative way
forward for international copyright. A change of emphasis on political strategies
could account for the concentration of these efforts in pursuing a ﬂurry of dynamic
diplomatic actions outside the frame of the Berne Union.51 Whatever the reason,
the focus on Latin America became a more plausible destination after the legislative
and political roads already opened by Torres Caicedo. Despite explicit references
having previously been made in Spain as to the ‘‘urgent’’ necessity of establishing
bilateral relations,52 the prototype of a bilateral copyright convention used by
Torres Caicedo became the model that literally served as a platform to negotiate
with other Latin American countries. It was a key communication for the Spanish
administration.53 In fact, the Spanish chanceries strategically used the ‘‘text’’ of the
bilateral treaty authored by Torres Caicedo as a springboard with which to initiate
contacts with other Latin American countries. However, such a use suddenly led to
unexpected problems. The text contained expressions that were difﬁcult to fully
understand in Spanish.54 After a careful examination, it was observed that some of
these linguistic controversies stemmed from the origin of the text, as it was a
translation of a previous French copyright bilateral convention also authored by
the Colombian diplomat. The Spaniards began to be preoccupied by the somewhat
loose language perceived in that ‘‘model’’. Despite these operational problems, its
importance was derived from marking a moment when the ofﬁce started opening
archival ‘‘ﬁles’’ in the Spanish chanceries. These archives were opened under the
rubric of ‘‘negotiations of treaties’’ and contained a series of instructions and
documents regarding negotiations of copyright bilateral agreements with Latin
American countries.

Oddly enough, for the Spaniards, looking at Latin America as an object of
enquiry was nothing new.55 It was indeed a long ‘‘desired’’ dream,56 something
beyond a mere economic playground,57 an object perhaps related to a powerful
political imagery that had historically driven the Spanish gaze to orientate towards
Latin America instead of Europe.58 However, the intensity that focus achieved at
this precise moment was not a mere coincidence. The initial contacts established by
Torres Caicedo somehow depicted a successful path to follow. In so doing,
opportunities for action were opened.59 Not to emphasize the economic or trade-
related issue of copyright law was a key issue in persuading and in initiating
negotiations.60 While not totally departing from the international forum, Spanish
copyright networking political activities appeared to be constantly moving by the
end of the nineteenth century. This is not surprising. The opening of ﬁles denoted
the possibility of accumulating singular legal experiences and administrative
measures.61 Somehow, the particularities of bilateral diplomatic actions were now
perceived as more feasible than the multilateral protocols in encapsulating political

8

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

Jose Bellido

interests for both Latin American countries and Spaniards. These routes were now
conceived as a more suitable forum in which to establish a type of negotiation that
the international political framework appeared to have already eclipsed. And
perhaps more importantly, considerable ﬁnancial frictions between Spain and the
Swiss government regarding the annual payments of the Bureau had arisen.62

Credentials and Narratives
In March 1891, a dispatch was sent from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
the Spanish representatives located in such distant places as Buenos Aires (Argentina),
Santiago (Chile), Caracas (Venezuela), San Jos ´e (Costa Rica), Mexico D.F
(Mexico) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).63 The particularity of this communication
is that it gave broad authorization to negotiate and to sign ad referendum treaties.
One of the traditional problems that had been found in previous attempts had been
the difﬁcult operational terms: the excessive formality of procedural diplomatic
rules and the systematic delay in providing plenipotentiaries suspended or delayed
negotiations or prospects of them.64 These impediments were indeed affecting
decision-making by cancelling opportunities for making quick interventions.65

The concentrated political activity in situ and its operational potential through
which the Spaniards now decided to promote bilateral copyright relationships was
touching upon questions of identity and belonging in a signiﬁcant way. Despite the
tremendous internal heterogeneity of Latin American countries—or precisely
because of that—kinship-related narratives were represented as the cohesive
ingredient when Spanish and Latin American relations were politically evoked. In
so doing, Spain was strategically programming the issue of bilateral or international
copyright in Latin America as a ‘‘moral’’ issue and not one speciﬁcally referred to as
of mere pecuniary interest.66 It was specially inserted as a topic that affected both
sides. Yet to emphasize the importance of the Spanish language in copyright
relationships revealed not only a post-colonial nostalgia; it also provided a supply
of conﬁdence to be shared. Evocations of having ‘‘something in common’’ were
wrapped in textual techniques that served to introduce those bilateral engage-
ments.67 Inside this organizing ingredient of language, there was also a concern with
practical issues regarding the future evolution of the language spoken in Latin
America.68 There was indeed an on-going controversy about the (bad) quality of
non-authorized translations from French into Spanish and the increasing appear-
ance of French neologisms in Latin America. Whereas discussions concerning
lexical inventions and linguistic styles were routed through the creation of corre-
sponding Academies of Language (Zamora Vicente, 1999, pp. 345–50),69 some
writers called for attention to the legal status of the circulation of pirate copies in
Latin America that were printed on ‘‘bad paper and with huge errors’’ (Oyuela,
1900, p. 23). That sort of hybrid language was considered ‘‘neither Spanish nor
French’’ and when attached to pedagogical desires towards the evolution of Latin
American countries, that impurity attracted calls for the need to regulate such a
wild environment.70 Bilateral copyright engagements and the space they provided

r  r 9

Jose Bellido

Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

for the stabilization of the task of translating were perceived as a suitable way of
solving some of the problems observed. The ﬁrst text of the Berne Convention
(1886) had problems for Latin Americans regarding the translation right (Bellido,
2007). Different models for organizing that speciﬁc right and the functional make-
up given to copyright as a mechanism for tying individuals together into a
community was imagined in a form that could not be perceived two or three
decades back.

Furnishing Trust

The animation provoked by the international copyright movement had also
achieved a peak in the Spanish press.71 Occasions for collective accountability of
the Spanish government had been facilitated by two literary congresses sponsored
by ALAI held in Spain.72 And when the Spanish government was held accountable
for its political performance, Spaniards started accusing it of being politically
incapable and inefﬁcient.73 After such public exposure and the criticism that was
concentrated on the occasion of an ALAI Congress staged in Madrid,74 the ofﬁcial
political investment of the Spanish government in developing an expansive network
of mechanisms to furnish trust was particularly intense. Organizing congresses
outside the ALAI framework,75 measuring an adherence to the copyright conven-
tion signed at the Montevideo congress of International Private Law (1888–9) (the
Montevideo Convention) and feeding diplomats with notes were among the
different ofﬁcial inputs provided now by the Spanish government. At that precise
moment, the textual routes towards bilateral copyright conventions became parti-
cularly concentrated.76 The new intensity of the focus brought with it political
tensions and perceptions of issues that needed to be selected carefully when
structuring a negotiating plan aimed at arriving at the desired bilateral consensus.
For several obvious reasons, this operation could not have been carried out in the
bureaucratic ritual established by the Berne Union because such an international
threshold could not have carried out a political miniaturization of issues. Political
problems arising from copyright negotiations were indeed heterogenous and each
country exhibited its microscopic singularities.

Systems of Reporting
The medium for processing negotiations was narrowed to the particularities of the
political environments within each Latin American country. It was a process both in
situ and ex situ that systematically teased countries and their respective states of
affairs apart. By relying on diplomatic processes, the communicative feedback of
this observing diplomacy displayed an interesting line: that for ﬁnding an opportune
moment for promoting the acceptability of copyright relations, a primary and
important sensor had to be implemented.77 A gathering archival device had to
channel copyright’s political resonance in Latin American countries, and especially
its impact on Latin American public opinion. That is, in order to create a favourable
climate for bilateral copyright contacts, special sensitivity had to be focused on the

10

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

Jose Bellido

impression upon the public achieved through the local press.78 The relationships
and engagements with the local press were peculiar, to say the least. Some Spanish
diplomats decided to intervene directly by publishing anonymous pieces in the local
papers defending the theme of copyright.79

Despite the appealing effect of those publicity efforts, they were adventures
involving a genuine danger. There was a substantial risk of being discovered and
unveiled. It was vital not to make the origin of the ‘‘interest’’ visible in public circles.
Because of this, the main engagement with the local press seems to have been more
cautious and more productive: a reliable system of reporting. Spanish diplomacy
was calling attention to the ways in which the local press in different Latin
American countries was treating the possibility of Spanish approximations in
copyright. In doing so, the scenario to engage was somehow prepared for the
moment of the treaty to be circulated in a Latin American Congress or Senate.
Among the different ways that show the material ‘‘recognition’’ of the importance
of controlling that motion for the Spanish fortune, one was established in Madrid.
It was perhaps the most signiﬁcant tool that attempted to apprehend this particular
sensitivity. The system of reporting implemented a practice of press-clippings. The
Spanish Foreign Ofﬁce initiated a peculiar kind of paperwork activity in order to
collect ‘‘news’’ referring to copyright in different Latin American newspapers.80 By
clipping items that related to copyright from the Latin American papers, Spaniards
were delineating and discovering in advance the temperature of the issue in order to
decide how and when to act. That is, by looking at newspapers it was sometimes
possible to foresee discrepancies and restraints that were about to emerge at the
table of negotiation.81 That Spanish diplomacy perceived the press as a dangerous
element was signiﬁcantly noted in a report chronicling the negotiation of a bilateral
copyright treaty in Venezuela. There, the Spanish diplomat described how he
literally handed over the draft of a copyright convention to the Venezuelan Foreign
Affairs Minister in order to ‘‘talk without witness, without interruptions’’ because
all ‘‘precaution is not sufﬁcient’’.82

Models and Prototypes
This simultaneous process of reductionism and enhancement by highlighting points
of reference and identiﬁcation of risks was particularly signiﬁcant in furnishing
trust.83 As mentioned, one of the important preliminary elements that could open
the door smoothly for negotiation was the use of ‘‘model texts’’ in the proposals. In
order to avoid what came to be objected to and categorized as ‘‘absence of
precedents’’,84 it was instructed that already signed treaties had to be attached to
documents from the moment of starting up a fresh diplomatic communication to
negotiate a treaty.85 Therefore, most of the discussions were initiated by sending
these textual devices to the other side.86 As a ﬁrst move, the use of a prior ‘‘model’’
of a copyright convention encompassed a standardizing and time-compressed
infrastructural beneﬁt for the Spaniards.87 That is, using a conventional ‘‘model’’
gave them a maximizing opportunity to ‘‘keep time’’ by beginning with an already

r  r 11

Jose Bellido

Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

existing textual reference. Additionally, this move had cognitive effects on the other
side. The display of empirical evidence that another Latin American country had
already signed a similar model was a persuasive mode of attempting the process of
negotiation. It actually served to minimize the common view that ‘‘other’’ Latin
American countries had been reluctant to sign a treaty.88 This latter effect should
not be underestimated, because it is related to the possibility of conﬁdence
emerging. By displaying that evidence, a basis whereby to start discussions and
modiﬁcations towards a future treaty was drawn.89 Indeed, there was an obsession
among the Spaniards to produce a ‘‘list’’ of countries that could be exhibited at that
precise preliminary stage of establishing contacts.90 Ultimately, the ‘‘list’’ was a
source of power at the point of launching a negotiation, an empirical background
with which to attract other Latin American countries to the table of negotiation.91

Communicating Vessels
By increasing the amount of information, Spanish diplomacy was attempting to
make a rapid estimation as to what was politically important to each country. The
fast selection process attempted both to reduce complexity and to anticipate some
of the contingencies that could arise during the negotiations. In doing so, many
issues were isolated but, among them, two persistent ingredients were identiﬁed that
were crucial in achieving a framework of institutional stability within which to carry
forward relationships: time and people. First, assessments about the future in
political environments were crucial for deciding on the suitability of a moment and
the necessary pace that the political approximation had to follow. Speciﬁc calendars
of legislative periods and political agendas needed to be drawn up beforehand to
reduce the risk of not having a ‘‘text’’ placed at the right time. Therefore, the
ceremony of initiating ofﬁcial contacts could be left to ‘‘rest’’ in case unfavourable
conditions were noted.92

Second, knowledge of prominent local political people was deemed to be vital
for the success of a negotiation.93 The acquisition of this knowledge on the ground
was carried out on the two sides of the Atlantic because intellectual interchanges
had created a fruitful network of relationships. Therefore, Latin American intellec-
tuals who were living in or visiting Madrid were often approached.94 And
prominent intellectuals in Latin America were contacted too. By being aware of
this productivity of personal relationships, Spaniards naturally engaged and
enrolled them to advance and to construct a setting for what they categorized as
a particular unstable political scenario.95 Secrecy surrounding several appointments
was important because the strategic value of this information depended to a great
extent on the conﬁdentiality of the movements and names. For instance, it was
relevant to name secretly individuals who could be keener to ‘‘push’’ a text into the
Congress.96 That decision was related to the management of personal trust. In order
to pass a bill that approved the treaty, it was necessary to bestow conﬁdence on
someone. The convention could have already been agreed, but the work had not
been ﬁnished. It had necessarily to move beyond the hands of diplomats in both

12

countries and enter into a realm that neither Spaniards nor Latin American
diplomats could control. Trust in local people involved an attempt to ‘‘control’’
the points of discursive entrance and exit of the ‘‘text’’ of the convention to be
ratiﬁed. That is, it was important to rely on a sort of custodian of the ‘‘text’’,
someone who could help its circulation through domestic institutions such as a
congress or a senate.

The main purpose was to recruit individuals who would ‘‘use their inﬂuence’’ in
order to predispose members of those institutions (congress and senate) into
favourable perusals of the treaty.97 That political investment was geared towards
trying to ﬁnd suitable local people to mediate an approximation to the doors, and
search for a smooth introduction for a text, its timely ﬁling and its favourable
circulation in those institutions.98 A political operation in which a copyright
agreement ‘‘passed through’’
included a genuine danger. James Barnes once
described this process as the ‘‘in and out’’ of a bilateral treaty in the Congress
(Barnes, 1974, pp. 49–74). Therefore, it was not only an issue involving people but
also a problem of performance in time. It was important then for Spaniards to
‘‘secure’’ and to ﬁnd the right ‘‘moment’’ to manage those personal trusts in
transitional momentums.99 Different periods of legislatures and calendars had to
be appreciated in order to perceive the plausibility of inserting the possibility of a
bilateral engagement.100 This issue was particularly important because one of the
common problems experienced was a breakdown in the process suffered by texts
falling apart when ‘‘circulating’’ inside these institutions.101 On many occasions,
bilateral conventions were ‘‘buried’’ because they were not listed in a political
agenda or because they were not introduced at a suitable time. Prompt action was a
particularly signiﬁcant ingredient because treaties were being signed ad referendum.
This meant that the core for the success of a negotiation was paradoxically outside
the direct control of negotiators. Those moments beyond the negotiators were not
only the approval by consultative committees but also the countersignature pro-
vided by these political institutions.102

Speed and Cipher
As mentioned before, controlling the pace of the opening of a ﬁle was crucial for the
success of negotiations. A skilled time management increased the likelihood of
success. Networks of communications inside a ﬁle show not only correspondence
between a negotiating (Spanish) diplomat to the other (Latin American) counter-
part but also a series of reports, orders and instructions produced within the ﬁle,
that is, by consultative organs in Spain. Those units of communicative knowledge
and instructive power had to be sped up because time delays between them were
considered ‘‘fatal’’.103 Additionally, acts of opening ﬁles and giving orders had to be
hastened because there could be cases of a Latin American diplomat initiating a
relationship with Spain.104 The ﬂuidity of communications and the possibility of
organizing them efﬁciently were inﬂuenced decisively by an administrative decision
taken by the Spaniards in the 1890s. That decision did add a tool for diplomatic

r  r 13

Jose Bellido

communications. It was formulated in an administrative order issued to diplomats
to use telegrams when prospects of a bilateral copyright treaty existed.105 Not losing
time and taking advantage of moments of political suitability mattered more and
more when the international copyright parades organized at Berne and Paris were
taken into account. Despite the fact that sending a telegram in the nineteenth
century was expensive, Spanish diplomats in Latin America began to receive
instructions and authorizations by telegrams.106 Fluidity and speed were then
achieved at a communicative cost. That is, the new medium of political commu-
nication attracted a different stream of problems. For instance, cipher telegrams
bearing authorizations evidenced a higher susceptibility for misunderstanding.107

Needless to say, the avoidance of sensitive issues that could serve as a potential
for conﬂict and the emphasis on the speed of communication was displaying the
Spanish Foreign Ofﬁce’s on-going desire to ‘‘know’’ and to ‘‘interpret’’ rapidly
different atmospheres occurring in Latin America. It was then a process that
involved the optimization of available data, management of time and a desire for
monitoring Latin American copyright-related problems.108 For the ﬁrst time, it
might have been possible to consider that copyright in Latin America had begun to
be staged as a central foreign ‘‘affair’’ in the Spanish ofﬁce.109

Variables

An assessment of speciﬁc circumstances brought unexpected issues. Of instances
then generated and variables automatically reported by the Spanish diplomatic
intercourse, there was a particularly heavy stress on certain copyright-related topics.
One of the constant worries that those reports delivered was the reference to
copyright problems related to forms of literary consumption particularly relevant in
Latin America. Among them, concerns focused on the identiﬁcation of the
troubling success of serials (folletin) or pieces of newspaper novels that were
periodically published in the local press.110 When Spanish diplomacy highlighted
the relevance of that practice of illustrated instalments, an ofﬁcial response from the
Ministry was routed to Spanish negotiators. That order was to take special care
with copyright frictions that could arise from that editorial practice. Commands
operating upon that issue were so sensitive that they could destroy a negotiation.
The practice of publishing short serials in the local press was identiﬁed by the
Spaniards as a risky issue to be avoided. It was instructed that serials were to be
treated as advertisements of a book instead of a copyright infringement of an
intangible work.111

The belief of the Spaniards that a bilateral engagement could be achieved
by grasping the particulars continued. That discreet process of taking notes on
the ground was followed by ofﬁcial attempts to delay private Spanish calls for
advance copyright payments,112 and by speciﬁc efforts deployed towards preventing
the initiation of copyright proceedings by private Spaniards or their representatives
in Latin America.113 Towards that desirable goal of making the environment

14

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

Jose Bellido

suitable for political relationships, holding litigation up was particularly laborious
because of the appearance of agents and intermediaries who claimed to be acting on
behalf of Spanish copyright holders. Those distinctive operations carried out by
Spanish diplomats were also augmented by a ‘‘gentle’’ endeavour aimed at sanitiz-
ing frictions between the societies of authors from different nationalities,114 and by
attentive observation of the diplomatic activities carried out by other European
countries in Latin America.115 Indeed, on several occasions, Spaniards tried to
synchronize diplomatic approaches to Latin American countries through observing
the interaction achieved by other European diplomatic envoys (mainly Italian and
French). The ﬂexible management of negotiations given to diplomats also opened
up opportunities of tailoring conventions, taking into account minor legal practices
in place in Latin America that were not of substantial importance for the Spaniards
but that could be used on the threshold of negotiations.116 Special care was given to
the legislative intricacies that differentiated Latin American countries. This man-
oeuvre was designed to keep a negotiation ‘‘alive’’117 and to avoid getting trapped in
them, something that was once seen as one of the main obstacles for the success of a
negotiation.

Bilateral; Multilateral
Again and again, many issues underlying bilateral negotiations appeared to be
pointing to a distinct horizon of international copyright relations being desired by
Spaniards and also by some Latin American countries. Perhaps what seems to
evidence the distinctiveness of those aspirations was that focus on the concrete when
coupled to an obsession to go to the limits of domestic law in order to succeed.118 In
sharp contrast with reciprocal relationships,
‘‘adjusting’’ clauses were indeed
operative in lending bilateral treaties a complex multilateral effect.119 Short dura-
tion of treaties,120 tailored designs of applicability (or not) of retroactive clauses to
favour Latin American authors121 and ready-made possibilities for renewing or not
a bilateral agreement (normally after 5 or 6 years)122 were attractive conditions that
were always within the limit of complying with requirements established in the
Spanish copyright law (1879). It seemed that those possibilities and their elasticity
provided chances for Latin American countries and the Spaniards to ﬁnd a kind of
inventive engagement; that is, an attempt to experiment an inter-national copyright
relationship under tailored schemes without a full long-term compromise.123

Crisis of Output
Despite all these efforts, or perhaps precisely because of them,124 the scores of
ratiﬁed treaties during those two decades (1880s–90s) were not considered especially
brilliant (Gonza´ lez Hontoria, 1899). It was not only that the high number of
bilateral engagements was not particularly important125 but also that key Latin
American countries where a considerable investment to relate to had been expended
(Argentina and Mexico) displayed complex situations around the question of
international and bilateral copyright.126 Latin American countries justiﬁed their

r  r 15

Jose Bellido

rejections in many different ways. For instance, appeals to the simultaneous
coexistence of ALAI congresses being held in Paris, London or Madrid under the
umbrella of ‘‘international copyright’’ opened a road to respond with gentle
answers when a bilateral negotiation was proposed.127

If Spaniards were not bemused enough by the increasing rate in the amount of
failures,128 bilateral agreements already signed also began to show symptoms of
poor performance. Some bilateral treaties already in force were not renewed,129 and
congresses and social gatherings designed to further relations showed that the same
diplomats who had participated in their negotiation discredited already signed
treaties in public.130

Downfall and Copyright

Paradoxically, the political and military downfall of Spain (1898) was the motor of
a new sense of connectivity felt between Latin America and Spain (Mart ´ınez Rus,
2002, p. 1014). Images that the decay provoked gave more ﬂexibility to political
communications. It deployed a setting that could now ‘‘realize’’ some bilateral
copyright negotiations that had been initiated years previously: new political
descriptions from which an institutional context between Spain and Latin America
could now be coupled to a renewed understanding of pragmatic issues. And
importantly, trust could emerge without the reluctance seen previously.131 Inter-
action occurred on grounds where Spain was no longer a colonial power. She was
deﬁnitely a ‘‘dying nation’’, totally humiliated in Washington and Paris, and that
also affected her inﬂuence at Berne.132 For Latin Americans, the geographical
proximity of a new emerging force, the United States, also provided a sense of
insecurity and a need for alliances.

What seems interesting to note is precisely that the positioning of the bilateral
copyright issue left behind some symbolic and material difﬁculties. Visible as it had
been in the chanceries throughout the previous two decades, ofﬁcial copyright
relations with Latin America became a prominent ‘‘issue’’ now literally placed on
the table of the Spanish Senate.133 That impact and its new situation now at the
centre of the Spanish law-making institution was quite signiﬁcant and could have
been perceived as suspicious by Latin American countries. However, that admin-
istrative and political willingness was also circulating within some ofﬁcial Latin
American channels. While the union created at Berne was now fully operative and
several frictions had emerged between the Montevideo Convention and Berne
Convention, other ways of thinking about copyright internationally were still
potentially a forceful possibility. Bilateral copyright engagements with Spain also
reached the agendas of Latin American cabinets, something not so frequently
witnessed in previous decades.

After the series of diverse and tempestuous episodes that served to open a bulk
of administrative ﬁles in the chanceries—operations that this article has attempted
to describe—there was an infrastructural momentum that had implications for

16

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

Jose Bellido

observations of the scale of copyright bilateral connectivity. A moment to draw
crucial political maps was forged. That moment normalized a narration of the chaotic
past of diplomatic copyright experiences by forgetting most of its peculiarities. An
interesting distinction to highlight is precisely how the ‘‘question’’ was moved and
was documented within the Spanish administration: while previous attempts for
copyright bilateral negotiations usually encompassed a set of practices and docu-
ments ‘‘elevated’’ from the chanceries to the Ministry, here it might be perceived a
different way as channelling those directions, that is, a set of orders instructed from
the Ministry to the chanceries with a central positioning in the legislative body of
the Spanish State.134

Ordering a Memorandum
Within the institutional reﬂexive practices engendered by the Spaniards that
demonstrate that shift stands an order to write a memorandum that focused on
copyright relations with Latin American countries. The Foreign Ofﬁce Minister
gave this order to a young diplomat called Manuel Gonza´ lez Hontoria.135 As a
measuring stick, this memorandum involved an effort to represent those archival
ﬁles in a particular manner. It was a practice of documentation containing a self-
observation of a diplomatic past that translated political experiences into a single
manageable document. Also containing future political planning, this text emerged
as a pivotal account in the management of copyright relations towards Latin
American countries.136 What seems interesting to highlight here is how readability
allowed for political moveability. That is, free from diplomatic forms, reading such a
document helped to orientate political programmes because it reduced (by ignoring)
most of the particularities of archival ﬁles. Some 35 pages of an ‘‘admirable’’137
document were not saying anything new.

The force of the document was not because of its content. It was just enveloping
a running synthesis that embodied a few diplomatic shortcomings, successes and
political experiences accumulated throughout the two previous decades.138 How-
ever, a hinge between the two centuries, the selective form given to the document,
had several organizing and cognitive effects. It constituted a printed reservoir of
archival knowledge. It functioned to summarize past political errors and to foster
relationality. While archival ﬁles were difﬁcult to manage, to be retrieved and to be
read for obvious reasons,139 a summarized account produced in typewritten form
gave a different and faster dimension to the issue. It was then a ‘‘note to oneself’’
(Yates, 1989), a document that was easy to read, a material simple to circulate
through different administrative places. By processing information differently, that
is, by clearing away those particularities of diplomatic forms, a picture of copyright
political relationships had been produced. That administrative document was one
that was capable of being physically transported from the Parliament to the
chanceries. It also constituted information easily assimilated by a speciﬁc legal
literature such as textbooks140 and by the different ‘‘policies’’ produced by the
Spanish foreign ofﬁce throughout the twentieth century.141

r  r 17

While it was impossible to forecast the ways in which Latin American countries
were going to approach the issue of copyright on the verge of the nineteenth
century, it was, however, crucial to keep a succinct index that extracted a variety of
responses already given, the mistakes that could have been committed and the
sensitive issues within the copyright environment that were at stake. That memor-
andum did not involve a traditional hope of learning from the past but a formal
structure in which a future was again opened. Not surprisingly, new decades were
embedded in new contingencies. They were, however, now managed differently. A
fortunate chance visit of an Argentinean navy to Spain served to stage a new
opportunity for bilateral copyright relations. On both sides of the Atlantic, the
spontaneous welcoming of the Spanish people and the enthusiastic reception of the
Argentinean travellers were highlighted.142 The simplicity of this incident and its
evocative power might explain how the situation was now under different condi-
tions of opportunity. Shortly after that episode, Argentina entered into copyright
relations with Spain. The ﬁrst two decades of the twentieth century then witnessed
signiﬁcant scenarios for copyright bilateral relations being deployed at an acceler-
ated rate. The decade was peppered by strategic gatherings sponsored by both
public and private Spanish organizations,143 crucial syndications of authors,144
simultaneous publication on both sides of the Atlantic of copyright essays145 and
concomitant legal measures attempted. It is not surprising then that those social
investments bore some fruit in the form of bilateral copyright agreements estab-
lished between Latin American countries and Spain.146 When the main ‘‘interna-
tional’’ copyright route initiated at Berne was uncomfortably perceived by
Spaniards and Latin Americans, mutual proﬁtability and fraternal relationships
served as explanatory arguments to produce a different type of copyright engage-
ment. Even those countries previously diagnosed as involving ‘‘considerable
difﬁculties’’ ﬁnally decided to relate to Spain in copyright.147

Conclusion

The craft of bilateral copyright practices at the end of the nineteenth century vividly
illustrates a microcosm with a set of organizational issues, bits and patterns that
tend to escape the traditional account of the formation of ‘‘international copy-
right’’. An attempt has been made in this article to consider how providing ofﬁces
for copyright bilateralism conveyed different ways of casting political relationships
that occurred simultaneously to the international copyright parades held at the
Berne Convention and its revisions. Copyright diplomatic renegotiations towards
and from Latin America (1884–1904) exhibited a rich and unexplored repertoire of
turbulences and impressions through which ways of inter-national copyright were
observed in different political cultures. Displaying some connotations, tempos and
institutional formats embedded in those ﬂuctuating environments, the issue of
relating to another country in copyright has been found to be a controversial
instance to confront, to reject or to approximate political alliances crossed by the

18

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

Jose Bellido

elusive ingredient of trust. The article has attempted to show how different
spontaneous events inﬂuenced the emergence of directives to conduct where trust
and/or mistrust appeared crucial to allow copyright negotiations to be brought to
life or not. The emergence of this dominant element that gives credit to approxima-
tions and that attempts to manage contingencies was precisely the device that short-
circuited political tensions and allowed the possibility of taking risky decisions in
ﬂeeting moments of copyright political excitement. As such, political communica-
tions and their assessments affected, through different layers of complexity,
trajectories of political and normative communications drawn up between Latin
American countries and Spain. In doing so, the article has attempted to consider
how the act of trust was couched in different material ways, whereby these
(copyright) bilateral relationships were being assessed and/or ‘‘realized’’.

Following some diplomatic routes that dressed up and sustained those pro-
cesses to establish political relations, two scenarios have been isolated. First,
throughout the 1880s, the prominent feature of a Latin American diplomat, Torres
Caicedo, president of ALAI, has been depicted as a catalyst for an incipient
copyright ‘‘interest’’ in Latin America. Second, the effects of an event that occurred
at the turn of the century, the ‘‘disaster’’ of 1898, have also been observed as
a crucial passage where communications within political
institutions were re-
structured and where self-observations that served to rethink regimes of engage-
ment for both Spain and Latin American countries were reproduced. In looking
precisely at the material assembly of that ‘‘ﬁnal chapter’’, this article has attempted
to separate a crucial administrative practice of documenting and collecting past
diplomatic zigzags. In a history of copyright diplomatic negotiations, it appears that
this documenting gesture not only closed a difﬁcult copyright century for both
Spaniards and Latin Americans but also formed a vital organizational learning
compass with which to grasp the basic realities of a past and to tailor a future. As
such, that reminder capitalized on the past, creating a political storage that would
be used by the Spanish Foreign Ofﬁce throughout a substantial part of the twentieth
century (Congreso Iberoamericano y Filipino de Archivos, Bibliotecas y Propiedad
Intelectual, 1953; De Sangr ´oniz, 1926a; 1926b, pp. 182–215).

By ordering a memorandum, a managerial practice that bridged a relation
between archival knowledge and political programmes was issued. The undertaking
was directed to the difﬁcult task of making Spanish and Latin American copyright
relations readable.148 It was a moment when the writing of the past became a way of
engaging in an open political debate. The peculiar form given to that document
provided for a ﬁnal institutional expression of a series of communications. It was a
turning point around an issue that would continue during the twentieth century to
be perceived as ‘‘one of the most important things that Spanish diplomacy should
pay attention to’’ (L ´opez Quiroga, 1918, p. 239; R ´ıos, 1904, pp. 9–13) because of its
‘‘great advantage and as a powerful weapon’’ for the safeguard of Spanish copy-
right (De Torre, 1933; Moro Garc ´ıa, 1952, p. 807). Insisting upon the creation of a
portfolio of bilateral copyright treaties with Latin American countries,149 several

r  r 19

Jose Bellido

voices emerged in Spain and Latin America demanding a multilateral copyright
convention that would ﬁnally organize and order that portfolio. For these voices,
bilateral copyright relationships denoted the last ‘‘round’’ of a narrative space. That
space encompassed an imagined dream that never was: an Ibero-American copyright
multilateral convention (R ´ıos, 1904; Silvela, 1892).150

1 Neither in France nor in Spain was the signatory of the Berne Convention unanimously
and enthusiastically welcomed. French reluctance is discussed in Seville (2006, p. 64) and
Bellido (2007). Several French associations related to the book industry such as the
Cercle de la Librairie were not convinced by the ﬁnal compromises achieved. Complaints
focused on the construction of the translation right in the original article 5 of the 1886
text of the Berne Convention. An association formed within the Cercle, the Syndicat
Propri ´et ´e litt ´eraire et artistique, promoted bilateralism as a better way to achieve
international relations in copyright. It was perceived that bilateral agreements
encompassed a wider (and different) space in making copyright ‘‘international’’. This
tendency can be observed, for instance, in the chronicles of the years after the Berne
Convention in Bibliographie de la France. Journal g ´en ´eral de l’imprimerie et de la
librairie. Chronique (1886–1908).

2 That future was anticipated in article 27 of the Berne Convention (1886) by establishing

a schedule of revisions.

3 At least since the ﬁrst issue of the journal Droit d’ Auteur, published in January 1888, the

sequential phases in the history of international copyright are retold in a teleological
manner. Bilateral copyright agreements are crucially depicted as a pre-stage for the
formation of the Berne Union. However, as we can observe here, many decades after the
constitution of the International Union at Berne, there were still bilateral agreements
being negotiated between countries.

4 A description of Torres Caicedo is given in Quijano Wallis (1919, chapter XII) ‘‘Viaje a

Europa’’ and Rivadeneira Vargas (1989).

5 He held a position as a correspondent in the Correo de Ultramar that was an inﬂuential
newspaper written in Spanish and edited in Paris. For a description of the journal, see

7 Some of his diplomatic activities in the United Kingdom can be traced in National
Archives (NA), FO 55/220, Domestic, Se ˜nor Torres Caicedo, Se ˜nor J. Arosemena and
various others (1871).

8 For instance, it was said that ‘‘[i]f the Republics of Spanish America would always send
eminent diplomats as eminent as Torres Caicedo, they would soon achieve the credit and
esteem that they deserve among the civilized countries of Europe’’ according to a
description given by Cesare Cantu´ , who was a member of ALAI, in Cantu´ (1882).

9 There were many variables around the distinction, some of them grounded on a racial
basis, that is, a ‘‘Latin’’ and ‘‘Saxon’’ race; see Quijada Mauri ˜no (1997, pp. 589–609) and
Altamira (1900, p. 1).

10 In a portrayal of Torres Caicedo, Spanish politician Emilio Castelar pointed out that
‘‘all his life was impregnated by the idea of uniting Europe and Latin America’’. See the
prologue by Castelar in Torres Caicedo (1868).

conventions between El Salvador and the United Kingdom, a failure that Guatemala
also suffered from afterwards for basically identical reasons: the need for the United
Kingdom to change its legislation to enter into such relationships. The British
government considered that ‘‘considerable modiﬁcations would have to be made in the
details of the convention to render it conformable to the powers conferred on Her
Majesty by the International Copyright Acts of 1844 and 1886’’. It was also stated that,
‘‘so far as actual works are concerned, the conclusion of such a Convention would
appear of little practical utility, and it may be thought in these circumstances that
Guatemala should be invited to adhere to the Berne Convention’’ in NA, FO544, sub

22 Torres Caicedo is described as a ‘‘discoverer’’ of Latin American literatures. His writings
were considered a ‘‘revelation’’ of Latin America in Europe (Carilla, 1989, p. 335). The
format of his writings portrayed different biographical sketches of Latin American poets
and writers and descriptions of works; see Torres Caicedo (1868).

I have put a considerable effort into initiating and activating this
negotiation, knowing that for Spain it is useful in both pecuniary and
prestigious senses . . .. It is also prestigious and useful for El Salvador
because, despite the fact that she is going to lose money, that recognition is
a tribute to justice and it tends to stimulate her emerging literature. (Letter
from Torres Caicedo (El Salvador Legation in France) 11 April 1884 to M.
Elduayen (Spanish Foreign Affair Ministry) in AMAE, TR 225, exp. 1)
In the famous ALAI congress (1879), Torres Caicedo read a signiﬁcant
paper entitled ‘‘La litt ´erature de l’ Am ´erique Latine’’; see Carilla (1989,
p. 367).

24 Enrique de Olavarria y Ferrari was, for instance, suggesting that ‘‘immense utility could

September 1899 in AHSRE, sig. 12-15-25 and draft of copyright convention between
Spain and Costa Rica in Archivo General de la Administraci ´on (AGA), sig.
6637–57.

25 Previous formulations of the same link can be found in De Olavarr ´ıa y Ferrari (1875)

and Ortiz Montellano (1876, p. 126).

26 For that reﬂection to gain strength, it was crucial that those decades had generated
bibliographic devices where statistical tables on national book production appeared. For
Argentina, see De Sagastizabal (2002).

27 A similar argument was given in North America by G. H. Putnam as follows: ‘‘[t]he

same result, in Europe at least, followed the understanding of the fact that the
development of national literature, and the adequate compensation of national
authors, is largely dependent upon the proper recognition of the property rights of
foreign authors’’. See his ‘‘Literary Property: An Historical Sketch’’ in Putnam (1891,
p. 82).

28 Quite recently, Gustavo Bombini recalled that moment by pointing out that ‘‘[i]t calls to

our attention that in 1884, with the programmes of Calixto Oyuela and Ernesto
Quesada, we have an absolutely modern proposal: they are the European literatures and
the North American literatures deﬁned as ‘‘national’’ literatures’’ in Berlanga (2005). See
also Bombini (2005, pp. 41–8).

29 For example, in Argentina, see Villalba and Lipszyc (2001, p. 4). That interesting work

begins the story of modern ‘‘national’’ Argentinean copyright history by highlighting
copyright issues regarding the judicial dispute over the novel ‘‘La vuelta de Martin
Fierro’’, which was the object of the litis in Hernandez Jos ´e c. Barbieri hermanos (1884),
and the case of Guti ´errez c. Podesta´ y Scotti concerning the unauthorized representation
of the dramatic work ‘‘Juan Moreira’’ that is ‘‘considered the initial point of modern
Argentinean theatre’’. See also Ar ´ıstegui (1979, pp. 425–7).

30 Visions of property as a mechanism ‘‘to enter’’ a community are explored in Pe ˜nalver

(2005). This crucial role was given to bilateral copyright agreements. Some of them
highlighted their role for the ‘‘progress’’ of ‘‘our’’ literature. See, for instance, in a
Mexican memorandum, October 1902 in AHSRE, 14-14-30 (III).

31 In 1886, several Mexican writers (Ignacio M. Altamirano, Jos ´e T.Cu ´ellar, Alberto G.

Bianchi and Juan de Dios Peza) sent a collective letter to the Mexican Minister in
Madrid (Vicente Riva Palacio) who had been recently appointed. That letter highlighted
the ‘‘urgent necessity of celebrating an international copyright agreement’’ because it
would be the ‘‘unique legitimate and productive impulse to Mexican literature’’ in
AHSRE, Leg. 14-14-30.

32 The operative rule is now displaying some problems in the digital world; see Ginsburg

(2001, pp. 13–6).

33 Of the peculiarities that affected (differently) Latin American countries, massive

European immigration touched upon the reﬂexive way of fabricating authorship.
Some interesting notes about immigration during these decades (1880–1910) can be
found in Tau Anzoa´ tegui (1996, pp. 532–7) and Villalba (1998, pp. 54–7). And that issue
had been voiced in several ALAI meetings. See, for instance, Bulletin de l’Association
Litt ´eraire Internationale, no. 15, August 1882, p. 8.

34 Taking into account that the most important producers of Latin American books were
located in France or Spain, article 3 of the Berne Convention was extremely relevant.
Article 3 (1886) and article 3.1 (b) and 3.2 of the Paris text (1896) where Latin American
‘‘authors’’ could be assimilated because of their residence in a country of the Berne
Union and, more importantly, the effects of a ﬁrst (or simultaneous) publication of their
‘‘work’’ in a country of the Union were opening the doors for the Berne Convention to
become applicable.

35 For instance, see article 2 of the Montevideo Convention (1888) that reads as follows:

‘‘The author of every literary or artistic work and his successors shall enjoy, in the
signatory States, the right accorded to him by the law of the State in which the ﬁrst
publication or production of this work shall have taken place’’. See also the comments in
Eisenmann (1894, p. 269).

36 For general remarks, see Fitz-Gerald (1924). Spanish copyright relationships with the

United States after the Chace Act (1891) followed the diplomatic formula of
‘‘exchanging notes’’ (canje de notas) instead of bilateral conventions. See ‘‘Canje de

r  r 23

respectivos a la concerniente a la propiedad intelectual fechadas en Washington 4 y 15 de
julio 1895’’, Gazeta de Madrid, 9 July 1896.

37 After the enactment of the Chace Act, a sequence of proclamations was issued by the
President of United States, extending copyright to citizens of certain foreign countries.
Among them, see the Proclamation of 27 February 1896 (Mexico); Proclamation of 25
May 1896 (Chile); Proclamation of 19 October 1899 (Costa Rica); and Proclamation of
17 November 1903 (Cuba). For the text of these proclamations, see Solberg (1906).

38 It is not a coincidence that Paul Groussac, director of the Argentinean national library,

prepared the draft of the ﬁrst Argentinean Ley de Propiedad Intelectual (1910). For a
wonderful account, see Bruno (2005, ch. 1). Also, Ricardo Palma, who was working for
the enactment of positive copyright laws in Peru, was director of the national library in
Peru. See Bernabeu (1987, p. 7).

39 Mexican and Spanish negotiations of a second bilateral copyright convention displayed

several ways of constructing different meanings around the word ‘‘reciprocity’’, a
concept (reciprocal basis) that was becoming crucial in international copyright: ‘‘It is not
legal reciprocity but material compensation between Spanish and Mexican authors’’;
letter from Mexican Foreign Affairs Minister to the Mexican representative in Spain,
9 March 1903 in AHSRE, 14-14-30 (III). An interesting account today is given by
Cornish (1988). See also previous interesting remarks in De Maeztu (1926, p. 184).

40 See, for instance, Convenio para el canje de obras literarias, cient ´ıﬁcas y otras entre

M ´exico y Honduras, 24 May 1881.

(1988, pp. 65–7).

42 See the preamble of the convention in Auza (1988, p. 65) and the commentary given in

De Sagastizabal (2002, p. 96).

43 For instance, letter from Ildefonso Garc ´ıa Lagos (Uruguayan Foreign Affair Minister)

to Conde de Saint Foix (French envoy and Minister of France in Uruguay), 17
September 1888, in CADN Carton 134.1: Montevideo.

44 European chanceries were aware of this link as evidenced by their practice of

cataloguing the document together with ﬁles that included the negotiations of
bilateral copyright conventions. See France in CADN, Carton 134.1; Montevideo and
Spain in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6803.

45 The deposit of exemplars was isolated as a key point in bilateral copyright negotiations

on several occasions. For instance, that was the major objection in the negotiation
between Guatemala and France. See the Letter from the French Legation in Central
America to Waddington (French Minister of Foreign Affairs), 15 January 1895, in
CADN, Carton 120: Amerique Centrale. In countries such as Mexico, the copyright
registry was located in the national library; see Angel Anguiano, Tratado de
Cosmograﬁa, Imp. de Francisco D ´ıaz de Le ´on, Mexico, 1887 with a stamp bearing
‘‘Archivo de la Propiedad Literaria. Biblioteca Nacional. M ´exico’’.

48 Article IX of the copyright convention between Mexico and Spain (1895).
49 By the end of the nineteenth century, the era of dramatic glory in Spanish literature had
already passed and the majority of classics of Spanish literary and dramatic works were
in the public domain. Spaniards started to publish new editions of those classics and
linked that repertory to the catalogue of (new) dramatic works. That editorial and
associative tendency was reported by a Mexican representative as an issue to take into
account when negotiating a new bilateral treaty between Mexico and Spain. See
Mexican Legation in Spain, 19 November 1902, in AHSRE, Leg. 14-14-30 (III).

50 Report of the Secretary of State and the Justice Department of Public Instruction

(Mexico), 9 March 1903, in AHSRE, Leg. 14-14-30 (III).

51 In fact, a contemporary commentator is surprised to note ‘‘the scant interest shown

by Spain in the commencement of the Berne Conference’s work’’. He continues by
saying that ‘‘Spain did not respond to the invitation by the Swiss Federal Council and
therefore did not participate in the First Conference held in September 1884’’; Bercovitz
(1986) at p. 347. The lack of interest seemed to extend even to the signed Convention
itself. For instance, ‘‘papeles mojados’’ (useless papers) was among the labels attached
to the Berne Convention and other copyright diplomatic meetings of ALAI in La Espa ˜na
Art ´ıstica, 23 July 1888. The late promulgation and publication in the ofﬁcial Gazette
of the text of the convention could be perceived as a reﬂection both of the difﬁcult
process and of the lack of importance given initially to the Berne Convention by the
Spanish administration. Also, some Spanish diplomats in Latin America appeared to
echo this sentiment by suggesting that it was possible to reach bilateral agreements with
Latin American countries ‘‘without the necessity of international conventions’’; Letter
from the Spanish Minister in Colombia to the Foreign Affairs Minister, 28 October
1886, in AMAE TR231, 008.

52 For instance, this necessity was noted in the debates held at the Spanish Senate when the

text of the 1879 Spanish copyright bill (Ley de Propiedad Intelectual) was being
discussed. There, Alcala´ Galiano y Valencia observed, ‘‘the most important [treaties]
would be those to be made with the American Republics, making them recognize and
respect the legitimate rights of our writers, composers and artists’’. After that
intervention, another Spanish Senator, Marqu ´es de Valmar, said that ‘‘. . . of special
importance would be conventions of this class with American States where Spanish is
spoken: however, you are aware of the many difﬁculties that have surfaced in America
and that have led to us being unable ever to achieve literary property conventions there’’.
See Diario de Sesiones Legislatura: 1878. Asunto: proyecto de ley sobre propiedad
intelectual (1878), p. 1949.

53 The convention was attached as a ‘‘model’’ to the Royal Order sent by the

Spanish Government to her representatives in Latin America in 13 July 1891, Disp. 29
in AMAE TR317, exp. 001.

54 For instance, the expression ‘‘fragmentos enteros’’ (literally ‘‘entire fragments’’) that was
contained in article 7 of the treaty was considered extremely obscure and grammatically
incorrect. See article 7 of the bilateral copyright treaty between Spain and Salvador
(1884) [Convenio de 23 de junio de 1884 entre Espa ˜na y El Salvador], which is identical to
article 7 of the previous copyright treaty between France and Salvador (1881)

55 For a history of nineteenth-century treaties in which political relationships were

initiated after the independence of Latin American republics, see Castel (1955) and
Jover (1999, pp. 111–72).

56 The commemoration of the Fourth Centenary of the Discovery of America (1892)

through numerous congresses and exhibitions put forward the issue of copyright
between Latin America and Spain as a central theme. The topic was discussed at a series
of gatherings such as (a) the Congreso Jur ´ıdico Iberoamericano (1893); (b) the Congreso
Literario Hispano-Americano (1893); and (c) the Congreso Social y Econ ´omico Hispano-
Americano (1902).

57 If we look at some of the mentioned congresses, when the issue of literary property
was discussed, it is signiﬁcant how it was placed together with the establishment of
national libraries and the unity of language. See Congreso Literario Hispano-Americano
(1892) and Congreso Literario Hispano-Americano (1893).

58 Particularly interesting is the reference given in an essay on the origins of international

law by A´ lvaro D’Ors. He suggested that the complexity of this gaze is not only
derived from a pure colonial interest but from mythical narratives enveloped in legends
such as El Dorado. See D’Ors (1946).

59 ‘‘I would be grateful if this convention, the ﬁrst of this kind that is celebrated with an

American Republic, could serve as a standpoint for analogous conventions between
Spain and the rest of Latin or Spanish American countries’’ reads a letter from Torres
˜nez de Arce, 22 June 1884 in AAEA. This letter, containing
Caicedo to Gaspar Nu´
this dream of becoming a sort of model for future relations, was published with the
convention in the ﬁrst Bulletin of the Association.

60 ‘‘[t]he sanction of intellectual property should not been looked at only in its mercantile

aspect but as positive cultural evidence’’ reads a letter from the Spanish Foreign
Affairs Minister to the Spanish Ministry in Buenos Aires (Argentina), 16 May 1896 in
AMAE, Neg. no. 0542. TR317, exp. 001.

61 Copyright litigation was documented in many ﬁles on both sides of the Atlantic and

it served to take political decisions. See report of the informe de la secci ´on de instrucci ´on
preparatoria al oﬁcio que precede, Secretaria de Estado y del Despacho de Justicia e
Instrucci ´on Pu´ blica, M ´exico, 9 March 1903 in AHSRE 14-14-39 (III).

62 See the correspondence from Spanish Minister Francisco Silvela to the Swiss

government in AMAE TR300, exp. 011.

63 Secci ´on 8a, Dispatch no. 29. Madrid 13 Julio 1891 in AMAE Neg. no. 0542, TR317,

exp. 001.

64 For instance, when the Spanish representative in Quito asked for credentials as

Plenipotentiary, his request was denied. See letter 18 November 1860 in AMAE, TR298,
014 or the Spanish Legation in Bogota (Colombia), which attributed the failure to a
delay in providing the plenipotentiary in the negotiations carried out through 1882–4; as
explained in a letter from the Spanish Ministry in Colombia to the Spanish Foreign
Affair Ministry, 28 October 1886 in AMAE TR231, 008.

65 Again, lack of credentials at the right moment was the cause of a failure in a negotiation

with Costa Rica during 1860 in AMAE TR 412/009.

66 And when the economic ingredient was highlighted, its beneﬁt was emphasized for both

Spain and Latin America. Castillo y Soriano, Actas Congreso Literario Hispano-
Americano, p. 23. Some Spaniards criticized that programming of the issue as mere
phraseology; see Ganivet (1897, pp. 96–100).

67 Signiﬁcantly, the format of the preambles of some of these bilateral conventions was
deployed as follows: ‘‘Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain, in the name of her august
son Don Alfonso XIII and the President of . . ., desiring to secure the exercise of literary,
scientiﬁc and artistic property because they are united by the fraternal bond of language
. . .’’. See the preambles of bilateral conventions between Spain and Costa Rica (1893)
and Colombia (1887).

68 A good account of how Spanish language became a central ordering issue of these

relationships is given by Guti ´errez Cuadrado (1989).

69 Some writers observed that there was a connecting point between copyright and the

Academy of Language. Ricardo Palma wrote a letter to Perez Gald ´os saying that ‘‘this
autocratic manner in which the Academy legislates . . . irritates our people and with
justice. Thus you will have an explanation, dear friend, of the resistance that there is in
Peru to adjust a literary property treaty with Spain’’; Rama (1982, p. 176).

70 Echoes of that spread of bad Spanish translations in Latin America appeared in Droit

d’Auteur, 1892, p. 12.

71 From the articles that appeared in Spanish daily newspapers regarding the issue of
international copyright, it is apparent that there was a moment of tension between
France and Spain on how to approach Latin America in copyright. A critical review of
the Berne Convention and its relationship with the bilateral copyright treaty between
France and Spain (1889) was published in the Spanish newspaper La E´poca, 17
December 1892. Those accusations were later criticized in the ofﬁcial journal of the
Berne Union, Droit d’Auteur, 1892, p. 12, and also sharply reviewed in Darras (1893, pp.
808–9).

72 Madrid (1887) and Barcelona (1893).
73 ‘‘What happens here in Spain is really embarrassing . . . if our diplomatic agents would

do something else rather than partying and barely jabbering French . . . How many
copyright treaties have been signed with South American Republics? But, however, they
all have been signed with Great Britain, France, Italy, and Portugal . . .’’ noted Sawa
(1892). Or ‘‘[s]omething we have to be worried about’’ commented one of the important
books on copyright such as De Ansorena (1894, p. 61).

74 Critical comments on that event can be mainly read in Ferna´ ndez Mart ´ın (1887).
75 Perhaps the most interesting was the Congreso Jur ´ıdico Ibero-Americano (1892) where ‘‘it
is remarkable that only Ibero-American (copyright) laws are discussed’’ in Eisenmann
(1894, p. 272).

76 The second edition of De Ansorena’s book on copyright signiﬁcantly deleted those

criticisms; see De Ansorena (1911).

77 Enactment of positive copyright laws in Latin American countries gave birth to a

series of Spanish observations interpreting those legislative activities as ‘‘opportune
occasions’’ to initiate bilateral contacts. See, for instance, a report on the Copyright Law
of Ecuador (1887) that was issued by the Spanish administration a few months after its
enactment in AGA caja 31 Leg. 6803.

r  r 27

Jose Bellido

Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

78 Latin American newspapers were really sensitive to issues of copyright law. For instance,

Mariano de Rojas transcribed in La Espa ˜na Artista a letter he received from Mexico.
‘‘Here the local press has launched a crusade against literary property’’. See De Rojas
(1898) at p. 1.

79 The Spanish diplomat in Colombia did so ‘‘in a newspaper of very radical tendency in

order to form opinion’’ as explained in his letter to the Spanish Minister of Foreign
Affairs, 28 October 1886, in AMAE TR231, 008.

80 Press-clippings were collected, sent and ﬁled by Spanish diplomats. See, for instance, the

news from Venezuelan newspapers La Opini ´on and El Tiempo attached to the letters
of the Spanish Minister in Venezuela to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affair in AGA.
Caja 31 Leg. 6803.

81 ‘‘Dailies as important as La Patria and Am ´erica Art ´ıstica from M ´exico pay special

attention to this issue’’ noted Mariano De Rojas in De Rojas (1898) at p. 1. In fact, the
newspaper La Patria wrote that ‘‘once we highlighted that the literary property treaty
with Spain did not beneﬁt Mexican writers at all; now we can add the following: it did
not beneﬁt Spanish writers either’’ in ‘‘Los autores no cobran derechos’’, La Patria,
Mexico, 18 February 1898.

82 Dispatch of the Spanish Minister in Venezuela, 14 May 1893, in AGA Caja 31 Leg.

6803.

83 ‘‘Trust is a particular level of the subjective probability with which an agent assesses that
another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action, both before he can
monitor such action (or independently or his capacity ever to be able to monitor it)
and in a context in which it affects his own action.’’ See Gambetta (1988) for a general
overview.

84 In the early 1880s, a letter written by the Spanish Legation in Bogota (Colombia) noted

this objection made by the Colombian Foreign Affairs Secretary. See the letter from
Spanish Legation in Colombia to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 24 August
1882 in AMAE TR231, 008.

85 ‘‘If

the Minister of Foreign Affairs ﬁnds

the

criterion that governed the

treaty between Spain and Colombia too restrictive for existing rights, the Spanish
Legation begs you to peruse the convention between Spain and Mexico, which is
much more liberal, being authorized to agree on identical terms’’ reads a document
sent to the Peruvian Foreign Affairs Minister by the Spanish Legation in Lima
(Peru) to initiate negotiations for a convention in Archivo del Ministerio de
Relaciones Exteriores (AMRE). Pro Memoria Propiedad Literaria y Artistica 1898
(ﬁle 6–13).

86 See,

for

instance,

letters

from the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry to the

Spanish Ministries in Uruguay and Brazil, 20 August 1889 in AMAE, Leg. 1382,
19–21.

87 Indeed, this infrastructural beneﬁt should not be underestimated. One of the

problems experienced at the very beginning of the 1880s was the diverse protocol for
negotiation in which some diplomats engaged themselves. These ‘‘back and forth’’
protocols and drafts needed the revision and approval of the Ministry of Public
Works (Ministerio de Fomento) and the Foreign Ofﬁce (Ministerio de Estado). See
negotiations in AMAE TR231, 008.

28

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

88 In fact, it was common for the local press to publish statements such as the following:

almost all Secretaries and Ministries of the Hispano-American Republics
have resisted and still continue to resist celebrating certain conventions
with the European nations, including the old metropolis, because they
understand that there is no advantage in doing so, and because if they are
making a treaty, they slave away and halt the progress of their respective
countries. (‘‘Las Memer ´ıas de un Secretario’’, Peri ´odico La Lucha (Cuba),
1900)

‘‘Chile and Argentina had persistently rejected it twice’’ was one of the arguments for
rejecting a bilateral copyright agreement made by a journalist in Caracas (Venezuela);
‘‘Teatro Nacional’’ El Tiempo, Venezuela, 16 April 1898.

89 It is not that a model was decisive at all. The point is that a model opened up the
possibility for discussion. That is what seems to be the underlying theme in a letter sent
by the Spanish diplomat in Mexico to the Minister of State, reading as follows:

additionally, self-esteem here tends to be exaggerated and none of these
countries wants another as a model. Mexico boasts about being the most
serious country of Latin America, and therefore wants to give the model
to the rest of the continent. (Letter from the Spanish Representative in
Mexico to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, 20 January 1892 in AGA Caja 31
Leg. Leg. 6803)

90 See ‘‘List’’ in AMAE, sig. H2830, exp. 011.
91 ‘‘Spain has already celebrated literary property conventions with the United States

and with almost all the Hispano-American countries and it happens in fact that those
have more interest in coming to terms than Spain. . .’’; communication sent by the
Spanish Legation in Lima (Peru) to the Peruvian Foreign Affairs Minister to initiate
negotiations for a convention. See AMRE, Espa ˜na. Pro Memoria Propiedad Literaria y
Artistica 1898 (ﬁle 6–13).

92 There are many examples where this management of time might be observed for political
purposes. For instance, it was said that ‘‘during the Administration of Mr. Ota´ lora, I did
not consider it suitable to move the issue’’; letter from the Spanish Ministry in Colombia
to the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry, 9 August 1884 in AGA TR231, 008.

93 In Colombia, the key individual targeted for his ‘‘importance’’ was Miguel Antonio

Caro as reads a letter sent from the Spanish Ministry in Colombia to the Spanish
Foreign Affairs Ministry, 28 October 1886 in AMAE TR231, 008. In fact, the target was
accurately identiﬁed. A few years later, Caro wrote the draft of the domestic Colombian
copyright law; Colombia, Ley 32 de 1886 published in Diario Oﬁcial de Colombia, n.
6,828, A ˜no XXII [14 October 1886]. In Peru, a renowned academic and poet, Ricardo
Palma, was interviewed about the relevant issues in order to achieve a successful
negotiation. That interview became crucial to drawing up an additional article to the
draft used in the negotiations as annotated in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6803.

94 These contacts and interchanges also occurred in Spain. For instance, a prominent

Mexican ﬁgure, Vicente Riva Palacio, became vice-president of the Asociaci ´on de
Escritores y Artistas in 1892. See Perea (1996).

r  r 29

95 For instance, a ‘‘public ﬁgure’’ from Venezuela (Dr Aristides Rojas [1826–94]) was
‘‘distinctively elected’’ by the Spanish legation in Caracas because he was ‘‘ideal for this
issue’’. See ‘‘Tratado Literario’’, La Opini ´on Nacional, Caracas, 22 September 1875.

96 A Spanish diplomat in Bogota noted that someone ‘‘. . . lacked the inﬂuence to push it
into the Congress, but now that Mr. Nu ˜nez has promised me his support, I suppose it
will be effective, I write to you . . .’’; letter from Spanish Ministry in Colombia to the
Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry 9 August 1884 in AMAE TR231, 008.

97 Letter from Leal (Spanish Legation in Peru) to Prado y Ugarteche (Peruvian Minister

for Foreign Affairs), 17 June 1905 in AMRE, no. 18 (ﬁle 6–13).

98 ‘‘The well known critic and dramatic author Samuel Blix ´en has been commissioned to

carry out a study in order to assess and to overcome difﬁculties to be found in the
Congress and the Senate’’, wrote the Spanish representative in Montevideo (1900) in
AGA caja 31 Leg. 6903.

99 Particularly relevant as ‘‘the holding or non-holding of positions of political authority,
especially those that regulate who has political inﬂuence in different matters and how
much, is what is important’’ (Luhmann, 1989, p. 86).

100 ‘‘It is this legislature which is the one that has produced some mistrust’’ wrote the
Spanish representative in Ecuador to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 11
December 1886 in AMAE TR 330, no. 0048.

101 When changes in this circulation of the text were found, the Spanish Foreign Ofﬁce

highlighted that it was not common practice ‘‘to change the content without prior
agreement between the contracting parties’’. These problems were found, for instance, in
the negotiation of the Intellectual Property Treaty with Mexico when the Mexican
Senate modiﬁed the treaty at the last moment. See AMAE TR 298, 006.

102 For a discussion of the value of signature and countersignature in modern diplomacy,

see Romero Tallaﬁgo (2002, pp. 61–3).

103 After negotiations initiated by the Spanish diplomat in Colombia for a bilateral treaty

(1882), ‘‘for unknown reasons’’ the consultative organ took 1 year to produce the
(favourable) report in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6903.

104 For instance, the Mexican bilateral copyright convention with Spain (1892) in AHSRE,

Leg. 14-14-30.

105 Letter from FO Ministry to Latin American representatives, 20 August 1891 in AGA

Caja 31 Leg. 6903.

106 Venezuela (18 August 1893); Guatemala (17 December 1892); in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6903.
107 ‘‘I have been able to ascertain the scope of the authorisation’’ reported a Spanish

diplomat in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6903.

108 It was extremely important to know the political terrain when carrying out this activity.
The Spanish Legation in Bogota (Colombia) referred to the negotiation of the copyright
treaty by communicating to the Spanish Minister of State that ‘‘I have been
accumulating data, consulting opinions and, inter alia, making propaganda’’. See letter
from the Spanish Ministry in Colombia to the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry, 24
August 1882 in AMAE TR231, 008.

109 In fact, if we have a look at previous communications held in the 1850s or 1860s, their
format differs. A unit of communication from Madrid to the different Latin American
diplomats took a standardized form without taking into consideration the speciﬁc

30

r  r Latin American and Spanish Copyright Relations

Jose Bellido

national context. See letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 18 November 1858 in
AMAE TR298, 014. Throughout the 1880s, ﬁles were opened taking into account
different Latin American nations. There was then a formal creation of a bureaucratic
context with its own communications, notes and instructions within the archives.

110 A likelihood of future harm attributed to a bilateral copyright treaty obviously appeared

in some newspaper accounts. See ‘‘Propiedad Intelectual’’, El Tiempo, Caracas
(Venezuela) 20 April 1898. For a general overview of the success of serials at that time,
see the special issue Insula, 693 (2004).

111 Letter from the Spanish Ministry in Argentina to the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry,

8 February 1900 in AMAE TR317, 001 and article X of a bilateral treaty projected
between Peru and Spain (1902) that reads as follows: ‘‘Peruvian dailies and newspapers
may publish novels in serials, without authorisation of the author, it being understood
that they will not be able to publish the novel afterwards if they take it from the afore-
mentioned serials’’; in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6803.

112 And that decision was important because the payment of royalties was one of the
arguments for the reluctance to engage bilaterally, as was made public in ‘‘Teatro
Nacional’’, El Tiempo, Venezuela, 16 April 1898.

113 Diplomatic actions were also directed towards routing copyright controversies and to
settling them out of court; see Spanish Ministry in Argentina to the Spanish Foreign
Affairs Ministry, 25 April 1900 in AMAE TR317, exp.005.

114 Enormous controversies arose in Mexico and other Latin American countries because of
the activities of the representatives of the Spanish Sociedad de Autores. Among them, the
appearance of false representatives and their pressure ‘‘on the ground’’ were making
copyright negotiations difﬁcult at the diplomatic level. The main reason for the
emergence of multiple controversies could be the lucrative character the job as a
representative encompassed. Indeed, some representatives of Spanish authors and
publishers in Latin America were earning 50% commission fees because of the
high risk embedded in carrying out that work. As I have commented elsewhere,
some of those representatives ended up in bankruptcy proceedings. See Bellido
(2007). A chronicle of those events in Mexico can be followed in AHSRE.
14-14-30 (III).

115 As an example, negotiations between Ecuador and France that led to the France-

Equateur Convention du 9 mai 1898 were observed by Spanish diplomats and used to
achieve the bilateral convention of 30 June 1900.

116 For instance, a previous deposit of three exemplars as a condition for copyright

protection ‘‘responds to the requirements of such a practice established in Costa Rica’’
reads a letter from the Costa Rican Minister to the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister, 30
November 1891 in AMAE TR298, 014.

117 See Spanish charg ´e d’affaires in Colombia to the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry, 24

August 1882, in AMAE TR231, 008.

118 Reports of consultative organs of the Spanish government (Instrucci ´on Pu´blica) usually

highlighted to diplomats the compulsory necessity of including most favoured nation
clauses. The inclusion had the effect of activating the agreement in case future
engagements with other countries were signed. See AMAE TR298, 014. That
compulsory requirement was indeed derived from a speciﬁc legislative section of Spanish
copyright law (article 51.2 of Ley de Propiedad Intelectual [1879]). However, it was not

r  r 31

Jose Bellido

explicitly included in some treaties such as the one signed with Costa Rica in AGA Caja
31 Leg. 6803.

119 That element found in the Spanish copyright law (see n. 114) was highlighted in

important copyright scholarship of the time such as in G.H. Putnam’s book. See Putnam
(1891, p. 50).

120 For instance, 15 years as stated in article 5 of the Colombian Spanish copyright treaty

(1885).

121 An example of this architecture is the following:

rights guaranteed by this Treaty refer not only to works published after
the ratiﬁcation but to all works upon which property rights are currently
enjoyed by Peruvian authors or their heirs. Rights recognized in favour of
Spanish authors only refer to their productions after the ratiﬁcation.

That was a Peruvian-Spanish draft convention in AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6803.

122 Article 12 of the Colombian-Spanish Copyright Treaty (1885). The exception to this

ﬁxed duration was the copyright treaty between Spain and El Salvador (1884) where no
speciﬁc time period was stipulated.

123 Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister, Ricardo Pacheco, was quite clear regarding the
initiative in the process of establishing relations. On 21 March 1896, he sent a note to his
Minister in Spain, Manuel Mar ´ıa Peralta, saying the following: ‘‘The role of making a
difference goes to Spain’’ in Archivo Nacional de Costa Rica, Relaciones Exteriores,
Serie Correspondencia, Manuel Mar ´ıa Peralta, sig. 302.

124 The interest in the concrete was indeed carrying an implicit fragility in the normalization

of relationships. This is an appreciation that lends more abstract inquiry a sense of
stability. While Spanish diplomats were negotiating, they did not realize the restraints of
Spanish law in negotiating those treaties under a speciﬁc reciprocal basis.

125 Only ﬁve conventions were signed and ratiﬁed: Salvador (1884); Colombia (1885);

Guatemala (1893); Costa Rica (1893); and Mexico (1895)

126 While Argentina was very reluctant to sign a treaty, Mexico denounced her convention.
127 ‘‘Despite the fact that I do acknowledge the manifest utility of a treaty to both countries,

I cannot start studying it because this Government is represented in the International
Literary and Artistic Congress being held in Paris (1896) and therefore it is natural that
conclusions there achieved will be those taken into account in treaties of this nature’’
wrote the Peruvian Minister Ricardo Ortiz de Zevallos to the Spanish diplomat, 6 June
1896 in AMRE, Nota n. 09, CC231, p. 7.

128 Attempted but failed negotiations in Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay,
Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua, Cuba and Puerto Rico are pointed
out by Gonza´ lez Hontoria (1899, pp. 21–30).

129 Mexico (1895) in AHSRE, Leg. 14-14-30.
130 Quijano Wallis, who negotiated on behalf of Colombia, suggested afterwards that the

signatory of that convention was only a sign of courtesy to Spain. See Gonza´ lez
Hontoria (1899, p. 17) and an account of the incident reported in Congreso Jur ´ıdico
Ibero-americano (1893, p. 298). The Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs was of the same
opinion when the bilateral treaty between Spain and Mexico was about to be signed in
1892 (AGA Caja 31 Leg. 6803).

131 According to literary scholar Rafael Alberto Arrieta, the participation of the United

States in the Cuban Independence war provoked a ‘‘sentimental adhesion’’ of the
Hispano-American Republics to Spain. See Arrieta (1980, p. 177).

132 Interestingly, charts of organizational diplomatic structure were also modiﬁed. To give
an example of the restructuring and prioritizing decisions taken by Spaniards and how it
affected Spanish visions of international copyright, the Spanish government decided to
eliminate her permanent diplomat post at Berne in 1889; El Globo, 23 August 1889.

133 The Spanish Senate Diary, 12 December 1899 reads as follows: ‘‘There were left on the table,

for the knowledge of Senators, two communications: The ﬁrst, from the Minister at the
Foreign Ofﬁce was a copy of the Royal Order that he sent to the representatives of His
Majesty in the Hispano-American Republics in order to strengthen bonds regarding the
scientiﬁc, and artistic, literary ﬁelds’’. See Diario de Sesiones. Legislatura: 1899–1900, p. 1560.

134 See AMAE, sig. 2830, exp. 011.
135 Manuel Gonza´ lez Hontoria y Ferna´ ndez Aldreda (1878–1954) was barely 20 years old
when he wrote that memorandum. Afterwards, he became Foreign Affairs Minister (from
14 August 1921 to 8 March 1922) and Senator (appointed in 18 February 1922). See his
personal ﬁle in Archivo del Senado, Madrid, Espa ˜na HIS-0200-06.

136 Gonza´ lez Hontoria (1899). Thirty years later, Gonzalez Hontoria wrote a famous
treatise on public international law. See Gonzalez Hontoria (1928) for the archival
material where it is possible to perceive the phases for the production of the
memorandum in AMAE. Leg. 1382.

137 ‘‘An admirable work that gives an account of the negotiations followed with Venezuela,
Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Caraguay [sic], Argentina, Brasil, Onduras [sic],
Nicaragua, Cuba and Puerto Rico has been published very recently. We hope that these
negotiations do not stop until achievements for Spanish writers and artists are obtained’’
observed the copyright scholar Manuel Da´ nvila y Collado (Da´ nvila y Couado, 1901,
p. 147).

138 ‘‘The memorandum gives directions, makes recommendations, but above all, it is a

means of transmitting information within the large bureaucratic structures organizing
virtually all work in modernity’’ in Guillory (2004). See also Yates (1989).

139 In fact, as a ‘‘source’’, archival material is a complex discipline because the researcher

needs speciﬁc knowledge in order to understand the provenance and the typology of
documents that are found in an archive. Another requirement that makes the
consultation a difﬁcult task is the necessity of an order in the archive, plus a patience and
ability ‘‘to read’’, because some of the documents involve different formulae, emblems,
handwriting styles, etc. See generally Lodolini (1993) for a general overview.

140 Most of the famous Spanish copyright textbooks and handbooks that were published
during the ﬁrst two decades of the twentieth century used that memorandum to narrate
the ‘‘state of affairs’’ with Latin America. For instance, see Soto y Herna´ ndez (1914) and
Vila Serra (1913).

141 See, for instance, the inaugural essay of the Revista de las Espa ˜nas by a secretary of the
embassy, Jos ´e Antonio de Sangr ´oniz, who became a prominent diplomatic ﬁgure during
Franco’s regime (1926, pp. 20–6), and the series of essays again by De Sangr ´oniz in
several issues (no. 89, 90 and 91) of the same journal. See also De Sangr ´oniz (1926a;
1926b, pp. 182–215). See also Congreso Iberoamericano y Filipino de Archivos,
Bibliotecas y Propiedad Intelectual (1953).

142 Chronicles agreed. See ‘‘Am ´erica y Espa ˜na’’, El Liberal, 18 April 1900, p. 1; ‘‘La Espa ˜na
del porvenir’’, El Globo, 9 April 1900; ‘‘Aproximaci ´on feliz’’, El Imparcial, 8 April 1900,
p. 1.

143 These gatherings continued the task of constructing trust. Perhaps the most signiﬁcant
gathering was the one held in 1900 (Congreso Econ ´omico y Social Hispano-Americano).
However, there were other inﬂuential events organized under the auspices of associations
such as the Uni ´on Ibero-Americana in which journal (Revista Uni ´on Ibero-Americana)
bilateral copyright treaties between Spain and Latin American Countries were
published. See Sepu´ lveda (1994, pp. 164–70).

144 The story of the collecting society was then narrated by Sinesio Delgado in 1905. A new
edition of that work has recently been published in Delgado (1999). Interventions of this
society of Spanish authors in Latin American countries such as M ´exico, pp. 199–202, or
Argentina, pp. 180–2, were crucial for the success of the society as I have explained in
Bellido (2007).

145 R ´ıos (1905) was simultaneously published in the magazine Blanco y Negro (Spain) and in

the famous Revista de Historia, Derecho y Letras (Argentina).

146 Copyright arrangements were signed with the United States dealing with Cuba and

Puerto Rico (1899), Paraguay (1900), Argentina (1900), Mexico (1903), Ecuador (1905)
and Panama (1912).

147 ‘‘Tratado de propiedad intelectual entre la Argentina y Espa ˜na’’, El Globo, 11 April

1900; ‘‘Tratado de Propiedad Literaria’’, El Imparcial, 11 April 1900; and Malagarriga
(1900).

148 Throughout the twentieth century, and mainly after the World Wars, that complex

situation was increasingly perceived as a problem. See ‘‘Chaos in Copyright’’ (1945), p.
45, and Mouchet (1969).

149 To achieve this aim, the Spanish Ministry will create a permanent consultative

Committee. See Decreto 2 Julio 1923 crea en el Ministerio de Estado un Comit ´e
Permanente Consultivo de Convenios de Propiedad Intelectual.

150 There were some voices who suggested that copyright between Latin America and Spain

had to be separated from international law rules because Latin Americans were not
‘‘foreigners’’ but ‘‘brothers’’. See Ganivet (1897, pp. 95–8).
