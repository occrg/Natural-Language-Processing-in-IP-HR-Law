Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’
Thomas Dillon*

What is the difference between evidence and lobbying? I’m
about to tell you. I don’t think there is any difference.

Prof Sir Robin Jacob1

Introduction
This article examines the nature of evidence for policy
in the context of a particular historical moment, the
publication and aftermath of ‘Digital Opportunity—
A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth’ (‘the
Review’), a report commissioned by the UK Government
on the future of IP policy.2 It considers the question in
the light of principles advanced by the Review, subse-
quent statements of the UK Intellectual Property Ofﬁce
(UKIPO) and the reﬂections of jurists and social scien-
tists on the interaction of scientiﬁc knowledge and
policy-making.

The Review attempted to lay down an approach to the
making of policy which gave primacy to ‘economic evi-
dence’, to the exclusion of the non-scientiﬁc opinions of
industry. This approach was seemingly endorsed by the
UK Government, resulting in the issue by the UKIPO in
December 2011 of a document setting out the require-
ments of ‘good evidence for policy’. However, by Sep-
tember 2013 the strictness of this approach had been
mitigated. The UKIPO said:

Experience and feedback tells us that whilst the general
thrust of the document is correct, the IPO needs to take a
wider view of what should be taken into account. Not just
hard economics and ﬁgures, but social research and case
studies.3

At a UKIPO-OFCOM seminar shortly afterwards it was
observed on the UKIPO’s behalf that ‘the IPO guide was
not being followed in most cases’. It would be revised to
reﬂect suggestions for improvement, ‘including the add-
ition of qualitative evidence to complement quantitative
research’.4 The guide was duly amended to soften its
requirements.

‘Digital Opportunity—A

troversy by attacking the submissions of the copyright in-
dustry as ‘lobbynomics’, proposing that ‘economic evidence’
should guide policy. This article tracks the journey of this
idea through the published statements of the UK Intellectual
Property Ofﬁce between 2011 and 2014 down to the judicial
review in R (on the application of British Academy of Song-
writers, Composers and Authors) v Secretary of State for Busi-
ness, Innovation and Skills [2015] EWHC 1723 (Admin),
which ended in the quashing of a key statutory instrument
intended to implement the Review.

† Examining the methods used by the legal system to

control evidence and the extensive scholarship on the soci-
ology of science, it suggests that the proposal that IP
policy should rely principally on the evidence of econo-
mists is calculated to diminish the legitimacy of policy
decisions. It ﬁnds that the Review’s recommendation was
unrealistic and unnecessarily restrictive of the types of evi-
dence that should be considered in developing policy and
commends the position ultimately reached by the UK
IPO.

† It is suggested that perceived problems of evidence for

policy should be addressed through better process, not ad-
missibility rules. The volume of submissions to policy
consultations should be rigorously controlled and a more
public, adversarial approach should be adopted to test the
value of evidence, including economic evidence, submit-
ted to such consultations.

Thomas Dillon . Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’

ARTICLE

93

In November 2014 the Review’s prescription in favour
of objective economic evidence was put to the test. UK
music right holders brought judicial review proceed-
ings to quash regulations enacted by the Government to
introduce a copyright exception for private copying. In a
judgment given on 19 June 2015,5 Mr Justice Green held
that the Government’s conclusion that right holders
would suffer no material harm from the exception ‘was
nowhere near to being justiﬁed by the evidence that the
speciﬁcally accepted and endorsed’6 and
Minister
quashed the Regulations.

In the end, little seemed to have changed. Govern-
ment would look at all evidence deemed to be relevant
to policy development, be it qualitative or quantitative.
However, according to certain UK legislators, in the
course of the Review and its implementation the UKIPO
had lost
the conﬁdence of right holders, who felt
excluded from policy development, and had suffered a
failure in the courts.7

The objective of this paper is to suggest that the pre-
eminent position proposed by the Review for economic
evidence was unjustiﬁed. It appears on examination that,
despite appearances,
the Government never wholly
endorsed the recommendation and quite quickly resiled
even from its qualiﬁed acceptance, reverting to a more
traditional, inclusive notion of evidence for policy. It is
argued that evidence from all sources, including that of
commercial operators, should be taken into account. Such
testimony is properly to be regarded as having evidential
value and its admission in policy evaluation crucially
enhances the legitimacy of resultant policy decisions.

Evidence for policy: the past
The taking of evidence has a long history in legislative
policy-making in the UK. By way of example, the Royal
Commission on Copyright of 1876 to 1878 took oral evi-
dence from 49 witnesses, engaging in a detailed discus-
sion with authors, publishers and others from home and
abroad as to the functioning and social consequences of
the prevailing copyright system.8 Through conversations

with men apparently of relevant experience, starting at a
general level and working down to very detailed discus-
sion, the committee educated itself as to the structure
and functioning of the copyright industries, as a prelude
to the making of recommendations through an exercise
of judgment.

This approach to policy-making has continued down
to the present day in the practices of parliamentary com-
mittees, at which persons supposed to have some rele-
vant knowledge of the matter under discussion attend
before a committee and give ‘evidence’, that is to say,
provide information and express opinions on the ques-
tions under consideration.9 The Whitford Committee of
1977 on copyright took oral evidence from many of the
267 organizations and individuals that made written
submissions to it.10

Although parliamentary committees

and public
enquiries11 still operate in this way, the modern style of
policy review does not adopt so forensic a process,
relying on written submissions, meetings (either private
or public) and commissioned research. An example is
the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (2006),
which stated that it had taken ‘an evidence-based ap-
proach to its policy analysis’ and ‘consulted widely with
a range of stakeholders in industry, academia and the
public sector’. It had considered 517 submissions made
in response to its call for evidence.12

What evidence should be considered ‘good’ in decid-
ing matters of policy is not just a question of obtaining
relevant information. The information has to be suscep-
tible of consumption by the organs of policy-making,
and be of a kind (or consumed in a way) that gives legit-
imacy to the ﬁnal outcome. Until 2011, at least, the legit-
imacy of evidence gathering in the ﬁeld of IP law reform
was principally conditioned on inclusiveness. As in the
parliamentary committee, there was no threshold quali-
ﬁcation as to the sources of evidence. As lawyers would
say, everything was admissible; the question of weight,
however, was a matter for the decision-maker. The Civil
Service was the ultimate collector and evaluator of the
facts and opinions. From its deliberations would spring

a Ministerial decision that aimed to be both correct and
also politically sustainable.

The review of intellectual property and
growth
The UK Government launched the Review on 10 November
2010. In a press release of the UKIPO, Baroness Wilcox,
the responsible Minister, explained the objective of the
Review. She said:

The future of the economy lies in the highly skilled, technol-
ogy sectors. For many of those companies their intellectual
property is their most valuable asset. We must ensure the in-
tellectual property system helps not hinders those companies.
This review will look at what changes can be made to our in-
tellectual property system to ensure it helps ﬁrms grow.13

Ian Hargreaves, a professor at Cardiff Business School
and former newspaper editor, was appointed to conduct
the Review. The formal terms of reference gave him a
mission to ‘develop proposals on how the UK’s intellec-
tual property framework can further promote entrepre-
neurialism, economic growth and social and commercial
innovation’.14

Professor Hargreaves’s conclusions were published in
May 2011. Although the Review asserted that there was
‘next to no evidence on copyright policy’, it issued pro-
posals for substantial changes to copyright law. These
were immediately accepted by the UK Government. An-
nouncing its intentions in a press release headed ‘Sweep-
ing intellectual property reforms to boost growth and
add billions to the UK economy’,
the Government
endorsed the estimate made by the Review as to the large
economic beneﬁts that would be conferred by its pro-
posed reforms.15

The proposals of the Hargreaves Review were wel-
comed by many.16 However, the Review’s estimate of the
economic impact of its recommendations was attacked

by right holders, and, after a process of evidence-gather-
ing hardly distinguishable from that of the Copyright
Commission of 1876, rejected by the House of Commons
Culture, Media and Sport Committee.17

the Gowers Review had been implemented,

Evidence and ‘evidence’
The Review included astringent remarks on the nature
of the evidence which should guide policy development.
Noting that only a minority of the recommendations
of
the
Hargreaves Review asserted that on copyright issues
‘lobbying on behalf of rights owners had been more
persuasive to Ministers than economic impact assess-
ments’.18 Given this apparent deﬁcit in the competence
or integrity of elected ofﬁcials, the Hargreaves Review’s
recommendations included the following:

Government should ensure that development of the IP
System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence.
Policy should balance measurable economic objectives
against social goals and potential beneﬁts for rights holders
against impacts on consumers and other interests. These
concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future
claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to
rights.

The Review devoted a chapter to what it described as the
‘Evidence Base’. By this it meant evidence relevant to
what it asserted, reductively, to be the function of intel-
lectual property, namely the creation of incentives for in-
novation.19 Under a heading ‘Evidence Driven Policy’,
the chapter referred to ‘three main practical obstacles to
using evidence on the economic impacts of IP’. These
were the intrinsic difﬁculty of assembling data on certain
areas, in particular unregistered IP rights; uncertainties
presented by new technologies or markets; and the fact,
so it said, that:

Much of the data needed to develop empirical evidence on
copyright and designs is privately held. It enters the public

domain chieﬂy in the form of ‘evidence’ supporting the
arguments of lobbyists (‘lobbynomics’) rather than as inde-
pendently veriﬁed research conclusions.20

The Review concluded that:

Economic evidence is not, of course, the sole driver of IP
policy. Legitimate questions of culture, fairness and ‘just
reward’ for creators also arise, and have tended to dominate
the debate on copyright issues . . . These questions are clearly
signiﬁcant, and it is not part of the Review’s task to deter-
mine how they should be resolved. We simply invite Gov-
ernment to consider that as copyright becomes increasingly
economically important, it is vital that economic considera-
tions are fully weighed in the balance . . . If the current im-
balance in the debate on copyright is allowed to continue,
the economic price will be high.21

The Hargreaves Review had been controversial with
right holders from the moment of its announcement.
With its negative comments on the quality of the repre-
sentations made to it, the Review issued an explicit
rebuke to those who had submitted ‘evidence’ on behalf
of the right holder interest—parties who were in posses-
sion of empirical evidence, but did not proffer it for
purposes of examination for objective, independent ana-
lysis.

Indeed, the Hargreaves Review seemed to express a
presumption against the bona ﬁdes of evidence submit-
ted by right holder interests. It claimed: ‘there is no
doubt that the persuasive powers of celebrities and im-
portant UK creative companies have distorted policy
outcomes’.22 The allegation that industry submissions
were ‘lobbynomics’ was easily construed as an imput-
ation of dishonesty,
the implication being that the
reason for non-disclosure of underlying data was that
the businesses concerned had something to hide.

This was new, in both content and tone.23 The Review
was asserting that past attempts to decide on IP policy had
lacked legitimacy, by reason of the uncritical acceptance of
non-expert submissions. They had relied on the wrong
sort of advice from the wrong people and come, therefore,
to the wrong conclusions. For policy-making to have legit-
imacy, empirical economic evidence, that is to say, evi-
dence of the right sort from the right people, was required.

23 Though the content owes much to the more measured commentary in

J Boyle, The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind (Yale
University Press 2008). Boyle was a member of the Hargreave Review’s
advisory panel.

24 Government Response, above, n 15.

The Government’s response to the Review, issued in
August 2011, included a broad acceptance of the Review’s
complaint that previous decisions on IP policy had been
inadequately based in evidence. It said:

[T]he Government will in future give limited weight in IP
policy-making to evidence that is not sufﬁciently open and
transparent in its approach and methodology, and we will
make it clear where we are taking this view. IPO will set out
guidance in Autumn 2011 on what constitutes open and
transparent evidence, in line with professional practice.24

However, the response continued:

While working hard to improve the quality of evidence avail-
able, the Government recognises that perfect evidence is an
ideal. As the Review recognises in its discussion of IP enforce-
ment, it is sometimes necessary to ‘guess and get on with it’
where the alternative is inaction in the face of poor information.

In December 2011, a journal article published by Ben-
jamin H Mitra-Kahn, at that time an ofﬁcial of the
UKIPO, conﬁrmed that the perception extended to
some in the UKIPO itself that right holder submissions,
even those commissioned from ostensibly respectable
‘lobbynomics’.25
consultancies, were presumptively
Mitra-Kahn complained that,
in their work on the
Review, UKIPO ofﬁcials were obliged to look at all sub-
missions made to them, and

that usually includes a large swathe of ‘grey literature’ which
can take weeks to get through, leaving very little time to go
looking for academic papers which may be relevant to the
policy questions at hand.26

The expression ‘grey literature’ consigned the submis-
sions of industry to a twilight zone: time-consum-
ing pseudo-evidence which prevented ofﬁcials from
looking for academic papers which would assist in their
proper task of creating policy. The author observed
that the Review had received ‘more than 200 written
submissions, numbering thousands of pages, with ex-
actly zero submissions of academic papers on copy-
right’27 and referred to the requirement of ‘dealing
with the many reports (think: hundreds) which are
part and parcel of the economic lobbying around copy-
right legislation—or “lobbynomics” to use Hargreaves’
term’.28 The article drew a cordon sanitaire between the

25 BH Mitra-Khan ‘Copyright, Evidence and Lobbynomics: The World after
the UK’s Hargreaves Review’ (2011) 8(2) Review of Economic Research on
Copyright Issues 65. The author asserted in a footnote that: ‘This paper does
not constitute a statement of UK government or departmental policy, and is
not an ofﬁcial response to the Hargreaves Review of IP. All opinions are
those of the author and should be represented as such’ (ibid, 65).

‘some
submissions of industry and actual evidence:
lobbyists have already set out their thoughts, but there
is still no economics in the conversation, and there
needs to be’.29

These observations shed expressive light on the way in
which the Review team approached the submissions
made to it. The analysis of the evidence for the Review,
carried out by UKIPO ofﬁcials, was seemingly animated
by scepticism as to the legislative status quo.

Understanding the new regime
In the context of the Hargreaves Review, ‘Evidence Driven
Policy’ clearly meant policy driven by ‘economic evidence’,
however that should be understood. Its recommendation
that ‘[p]olicy should balance measurable economic objec-
tives against social goals’ also asserted a general principle of
policy appraisal. Although the Review did not propose that
‘economic evidence’ should be the only matter considered
in developing policy, it asserted not only that such evidence
was indispensable to policy debate, but also that it should
enjoy a privileged position as the objective foundation for
reform. The Review proposed an approach to evidence
that ‘demands standards of transparency and openness in
both methodology and data’. This amounted to a rule as to
the admissibility of evidence. The intention was to exclude
‘“evidence” supporting the arguments of lobbyists (“lobby-
nomics”)’ which, as the use of quotation marks indicated,
was not in the view of the Review truly evidence at all.30

Clearly, the Review intended to send an important
message to those hoping to inﬂuence the course of
policy development. What, however, did it mean in
practice? Although the Review had referred to articles
and studies by economists, the way in which it justiﬁed
its conclusions seemed similar to previous reports. For
example, one of the Review’s most signiﬁcant propo-
sals for legislative change was that a private copying ex-
ception should be introduced to copyright law. In
explaining that recommendation, the Review cited a
single anecdote relating to a CD copying device called
the Brennan J7 Music Player. It stated that ‘[t]here is
considerable evidence of overall public beneﬁts from
consumer use’.31 However, it did not give a reference
to this evidence, nor was there any explanation of the
relationship between ‘public beneﬁts’ and the promo-
tion of economic growth. On the face of things, the
Review had made an impressionistic judgment about

the growth beneﬁts of the change and made its recom-
mendation accordingly.

‘Good evidence for policy’: version 1
In December 2011, as part of its implementation of the
Review, the UKIPO published a short paper entitled
‘Good Evidence for Policy’. This paper was intended to
stand as ‘guidance on standards of evidence used in the
development of policy’. However, the paper limited its
scope: ‘Evidence of course comes in many forms, and this
is aimed at reports and research done to inform policy-
makers’.32 It offered no guidance in relation to the accept-
ability of evidence which did not purport to be research.

The paper expressed the ‘aspiration’ that evidence (ie re-
search evidence) intended to inform Government should
meet three criteria. It should be clear, veriﬁable and
peer-reviewed. Clarity required the statement of assump-
tions and the complete disclosure of calculations and data
underlying graphs and ﬁgures. The identity of the persons
commissioning research should be disclosed, on the
grounds that ‘the availability of data may be different for
different organisations’.33 This was surely somewhat eu-
phemistic: the concern was surely as to the risk of interest
or bias.

In addition, the conclusions of analysis had to be ‘veriﬁ-
able by a third party’. This meant that data, such as survey
data, had to be disclosed, together with a clear description
of their statistical treatment (eg any weighting or extrapola-
tion). The workings of the treatment had to be disclosed,
so that ‘interested parties’ should be ‘able to re-create the
given conclusions without the need to use other sources
and without the need to assume any steps by the authors’.34
Finally, the UKIPO stated its belief that ‘the best way
to generate good evidence-driven discussion about
policy is to expose analysis to peer-review’. It explained
that this involved

making reports and submissions available to other interest-
groups and the public to get feed-back and comments in a
public forum before submitting to Government. If this is
not possible, studies should at least be published in a form
which makes peer review possible.35

The UKIPO stated that its own commissioned research
would appear in a ‘peer-reviewable format before going
to ﬁnal press, and [would] be available to the public to
comment on’.

Thomas Dillon . Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’

ARTICLE

97

The paper stated that the UKIPO would continue to
‘accept’ evidence that did not meet its standards. It
indicated that it would consider ‘sympathetically’ the
submissions of smaller businesses, as these might ‘face
challenges in assembling evidence’. The UKIPO wished
to emphasize that ‘individual experience and ideas are
always welcome in the evidence debate’. However, the
paper did not attempt to square this generosity with
the strictures of the Review on the acceptability of evi-
dence. Perhaps the notion was that such experience and
ideas would enter into the consideration of the ‘social
goals’ against which the Review had said ‘economic evi-
dence’ could be weighed.

From the perspective of some UKIPO ofﬁcials, at least,
the objective of ‘Good Evidence for Policy’ was to obviate
the need to review the ‘large swathe of “grey literature”’ of
which Mitra-Kahn had complained.36 Even if the purport
of the Review had clearly been to exclude from consider-
ation non-academic evidence from industry, by expressly
limiting its scope to ‘reports and research done to inform
policy-makers’,
the guidance itself did not explicitly
address the acceptability such non-scientiﬁc testimony.

Subsequent debate
In November 2012, a conference was held at Bourne-
mouth University, entitled What Constitutes Evidence for
Copyright Policy, chaired by Professors Martin Kretsch-
mer and Ruth Towse. The conference brought together
lawyers, economists and staff of the UKIPO.37 In an
introductory essay to the published record of proceed-
ings, Kretschmer and Towse summarized the preference
of government ofﬁcials as being

for a participatory process in which all types of qualitative in-
formation could be moulded into an overall set of evidence
that was implicitly weighted and interpreted in terms of the
government framework. Acceptable evidence could be quali-
tative, quantitative, experiential and even of the ‘story’ type.38

In expressing such views, the ofﬁcials were reinstating
the traditional approach to evidence for policy, albeit
one informed by an appreciation of post-modern ideas
about objectivity.40 Turning evidence into policy is a
function of the Civil Service. Its familiarity with the
nature of the material available for the purpose of
policy-making and its ability to synthesize it constitute
important aspects of its professional expertise.

In September 2013, a further discussion of the issue
of evidence for policy took place in London at a work-
shop organized by the UKIPO and telecoms regulator,
OFCOM. Shortly before the event, the UKIPO wrote in
its UKIPO Facto blog:

Experience and feedback tells us that whilst the general
thrust of the document [ie the IPO paper, ‘Good Evidence
for Policy’] is correct, the IPO needs to take a wider view of
what should be taken into account. Not just hard economics
and ﬁgures, but social research and case studies.41

At the workshop, the IPO’s then-Chief Economist
Tony Clayton, stated that the IPO would amend ‘Good
Evidence for Policy’ to take account of suggestions for
improvement, including the addition of qualitative evi-
dence and case studies.42

‘Good evidence for policy’: version 2
In early 2014 the IPO published a revised version of
‘Good Evidence for Policy’. Now entitled ‘Guide to Evi-
dence for Policy’, the document contained some subtle
adjustments.43 The Guide stated that its criteria were ‘rele-
vant to social research, to case study work and to econom-
ic evidence. Policy evaluation often depends on all three,
especially where economic costs and beneﬁts need to be
weighed against social impacts and effects on behaviour’.44
It observed that case studies could be ‘particularly valu-
able’, stating, perhaps surprisingly in view of the strictures
of the Review, that ‘some of the most effective submissions
to Hargreaves used them’.45

Indeed, it was observed that case studies often provided
insight into public behaviour.39

In relation to the desirability of transparency, the
Guide stated that ‘[c]lear indication of funding should

(accessed 22 December 2015).

The point about having some principles for what evidence should be
adhered to is just to avoid us getting our time wasted . . . It’s much
easier if you’ve actually got a thing which says, I’m terribly sorry but
you haven’t read our standards; we’re going to put this straight in the
bin.

not undermine good research evidence which meets
the criteria’. As for veriﬁability, the Guide added that
reports should include any data used ‘where possible’,
so acknowledging the fact that commercial data may
legitimately be regarded as conﬁdential. The Guide
acknowledged that open sharing of data ‘is not always
possible, because of commercial conﬁdentiality or data
protection constraints’.46

The new guidance added the promise that ‘wherever
possible’ the evidence underlying Government impact as-
sessments would follow the principles set out in the Guide
‘recognising that in some cases there is a need to estimate
economic and behaviour changes in new situations, of
which there is no prior UK experience’.47 In so stating, the
UKIPO was perhaps recognizing that the controversial
impact assessments that it had prepared in the course of
implementing the Review’s recommendations had not
complied with the strictures of the original version of the
Guide.48 Indeed, in acknowledging that the effect of new
measures might have to be assessed through estimates and
without direct evidence, the Guide recognized the potential
legitimacy of arguments based on non-empirical premises.
The revised Guide ended with an intriguing amend-
ment. Its ﬁrst version had concluded with the observation
that the three criteria of clarity, veriﬁability and peer-review
would permit policy design to focus on ‘the best way of
meeting the needs of interested parties rather than disputes
over what those needs are’.49 The revised version concluded
by referring to a focus on ‘the best way of meeting the
needs of interested parties rather than disputes over how
the evidence describing those needs is best described’.50 So
the revised guidance retained the initial manoeuvre of lim-
iting itself to ‘reports and research done to inform policy-
makers’,51 but added an indication that the UKIPO would
not pay much attention to arguments about the quali-
ﬁcation of evidence. This reﬁnement seemed to limit
further the scope for arguments in favour of the exclusion
of evidence on the grounds of its character or source.

At the end of this process, the position had been
reached that evidence which purported to be research
should comply where possible with the criteria of clarity
of argument, transparency of interest, veriﬁability and
susceptibility to peer-review. The UKIPO would not,
however, be receptive to threshold arguments about the
admissibility of submissions. As it was the explicit inten-
tion of the Review to qualify certain kinds of submission
as ‘evidence’ and relegate the rest to serve as mere quali-
tative counterweights to be balanced against ‘measurable
economic objectives’, this conclusion was in substance a
rejection of the Review’s prescription.

‘Economic evidence’ in action
If, by the beginning of 2014, the UKIPO had retreated
from the Review’s doctrine of the supremacy of ‘eco-
nomic evidence’,
it had given the new approach an
outing in the intervening period. In its response to the
Review in December 2011, the Government announced
that it wished to introduce various extended copyright
exceptions as recommended by the Review, including, as
mentioned above, a private copying exception. The rele-
vant European Directive permitted such an exception,
‘on condition that the rightholders receive fair compen-
sation’.52 The Government argued that no compensation
was needed for a narrowly deﬁned private copying ex-
ception, on the basis that the value of such copying was
already included in the price paid to vendors of copy-
right-protected products (the ‘pricing-in theory’).53 In
December 2012 it published its conclusions, indicating
on the subject of the private copying exception that it
was satisﬁed that its original views were correct, and
issued an impact assessment, subsequently revised, that
purported to show that right holders would suffer no (or
de minimis) harm as a result of such an exception.

In August 2014 the Government enacted a statutory
instrument to insert a new s 28B in the Copyright,

Ibid, 5. The Guide suggested that commercial conﬁdentiality was not a
barrier to peer review, as there were systems for making data available on
a secure basis to others, such as the Secure Data Service available to
academics and the Ofﬁce of National Statistics’ Virtual Microdata
Laboratory. These systems impose various restrictions on the persons who
may access data, the purposes for which they may do so and the nature of
the data made available. No equivalent system appears to exist for the
sharing of commercial data, nor is it easy to see how such a system could
be protected from access by competitors or interested journalists. It seems
unlikely that academic researchers would be willing to undertake the
veriﬁcation of industry submissions based on such protected data if they
were not to be permitted fully to publish their conclusions or the
underlying data required for peer review.

Designs and Patents Act 1988, which established a
private copy exception without compensation for copy-
right owners.54 Several other exceptions were intro-
duced. All the draft statutory instruments were backed
by impact assessments, setting out the evidence on
which the Government had based its legislative choices.

The three criteria
The Guide’s criterion of clarity was in fact two criteria.
First, evidence should be clear as to any assumptions. Sec-
ondly, it should disclose any potential interest resulting
from the identity of its commissioners. The criteria of ver-
iﬁability and peer-reviewability seem to amount more or
less to the same thing, given that the Guide, in both its
original and revised versions, did not require that research
actually be peer-reviewed before acceptance.

It seems that veriﬁability has little effect on the
standing of academic research. Various studies have
shown that the career of an academic paper is not ne-
cessarily affected by its public retraction as incorrect or
even fraudulent, let alone the fact that other scholars
have been unable to verify its conclusions.55 Indeed,
according to Judge Posner, the tradition of replicating
previous academic studies is weaker in economics than
in the natural sciences.56 In any case, nothing requires
the policy-maker to refer to any particular piece of
expert or other evidence in explaining his reasons for a
policy choice. Formal controls on policy argumenta-
tion are limited; and, given the stipulations of the
Review, non-scientiﬁc right holder evidence offered no
basis for reconsideration of the Government’s policy
conclusions.57

The policy-making process in this respect is markedly
different from the judicial process, in that it is in prin-
ciple the parties who decide what evidence shall be con-
sidered by the tribunal. The tribunal can only with
difﬁculty elide evidence that is unsupportive of a pre-
ferred conclusion, given the public scrutiny of its reasons
and the possibility of appeal to a higher court.

As for peer review, the Review had not,

in fact,
demanded that evidence be peer-reviewed, although
Mitra-Khan appears to have regarded it as an important
token of reliability. The concept of peer review derives
from the practice of respected academic journals. Such
journals typically submit the draft text of an article for
review by one or more competent academics, usually on
an anonymous basis. If the draft is adjudged inadequate,
it will be declined or changes will be requested. In this
way the journal protects its reputation and enhances the
inﬂuence of the authors that it publishes. Evidently, the
essence of peer review is review by peers, that is to say,
persons of equivalent professional competence in the
relevant ﬁeld. Peer review is thus a heuristic of reliability.
This classical conception of peer review has been
extended beyond the world of academic publishing. As
applied to public policy, it is reﬂected by the California
Health and Safety Code. This requires the scientiﬁc basis
of any proposed environmental regulation by the Cali-
fornia Environmental Protection Agency to be submit-
ted to ‘external scientiﬁc peer review’ by one or more
academic scientists to establish that the proposed rule is
‘based upon sound scientiﬁc knowledge, methods, and
practices’.58

However, the use of the concept in ‘Good Evidence
for Policy’ was untraditional. According to the guidance,
peer review ‘mean[t] making reports and submissions
available to other interest groups and the public to get
feed-back and comments in a public forum before sub-
mitting to Government’.59 This kind of public exposure
would hardly amount to review by peers. The guidance
did not explain how the comments of such ‘peer
reviewers’ would be imparted to Government and how
the public would be assured that they were taken proper-
ly into account. Such ‘peer review’ would take place
outside the structure of incentives that in the normal
case works to improve the standard of published re-
search. Still less would the publication of a study ‘in a
form which makes peer review [as so deﬁned] possible’
confer much assurance of reliability.

In the UK, the current practice is for the case for a ministerial legislative
decision to be set out in an Impact Assessment. Such papers are subject to
some level of scrutiny from the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC), an
independent advisory non-departmental public body. In the case of the
Government’s proposal for a private copying exception, the UKIPO’s
impact assessment was submitted to the RPC on 26 September 2012 and
received a slightly sceptical, two-paragraph clearance on 4 October 2012
(RPC reference: RPC11-BIS-1055(3)).

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 2

It is important in the present context to note how
peer review functions so as to provide some warranty of
quality to consumers. The reader never knows what
comments have been made by the peer reviewers, nor is
there any objective criterion by which the effectiveness of
the review can be measured. However, the fact that the
process exists coupled with the apparent self-interest of
the journal and that of the whole body of its past and po-
tential future authors (who may serve as peer reviewers)
in maintaining their reputations justify the reader in
making the inference that publication in the journal
confers a guarantee of quality. In other words, the repu-
tation of a peer-reviewed journal is a warranty of the
quality of the articles that it publishes. The reader may
be quite unable to judge whether any particular article is
good, but he can probably work out quite easily what
opinion is generally held of a journal. If the journal cred-
ibly asserts that peer review is a condition of publication,
the consumer can draw an inference of reliability.

It is difﬁcult to see how this function could operate
in relation to work which is not published in a con-
text in which the interests of publisher, authors and
consumers converge. It would not provide any gua-
rantee of quality for a journal to advertise that its
authors’ articles might have been, but were not, peer-
reviewed. Review, whether by a peer or anyone else, is
a factor which will tend to improve the quality of
research, through the possible identiﬁcation of error.
However, the fact that a piece of research could be
‘peer-reviewed’ would not add anything to the propos-
ition that the research was veriﬁable. One might infer
from the willingness of an author to submit to review
that he was conﬁdent in his results, but hardly that
they were correct.

Academic research on peer review indicates that its
value within the scientiﬁc disciplines is highly question-
able.60 For those outside science who may have to rely
upon expertise, such as judges or policy-makers, its val-
idity as a guarantee of reliability is undeniably weak. As
Haack observes,

the fact that work has passed pre-publication peer review is
no guarantee that it is not ﬂawed or even fraudulent; and
the fact that work has been rejected by reviewers is no guar-
antee that it is not an important advance.61

Policymakers (Harvard University Press 1990) 61 –62:

Advocates of peer review tend to assume that the line between
acceptable and unacceptable science is objectively veriﬁable, available
to be discovered by any competent reviewer. Yet the empirical

Lessons from the BASCAcase
The correct answer to the question in the BASCA case,
namely, whether on the evidence a private copying ex-
ception could be introduced without compensation to
right holders, is not material to this paper. However, the
case provides a striking example of the difﬁculty of using
economic evidence for policy-making and illustrates two
important points about the role of experts, including
economists.

First, as Jasanoff points out, given the role of the
courts in a liberal democracy there is ultimately no
escape for policy-makers into the authority of expert-
ise. She observes in a US context similar to that of
the UK:

Review by generalist judges symbolizes this nation’s adher-
ence to the principle that all governmental actions, however
arcane or esoteric, must be explained in terms that are com-
prehensible to nonexpert audiences. By insisting on their
prerogatives in this regard, courts have repeatedly afﬁrmed
that the ultimate power to guide technology policy is vested
not in experts but in the citizenry.62

Secondly, although in ‘Good Evidence for Policy’ the
UKIPO asserted that the standards there set out ‘are
what we aspire to ourselves’, the reality is that policy-
making is politics and the making of laws involves per-
suasion, and hence advocacy. A technocratic approach is
difﬁcult to implement in a complex democracy.

The policy-making process in relation to the private
copying exception was constrained by the Government’s
political starting-point that it would not introduce com-
pensation for right holders, a principle for which neither
the Review nor the Government offered any positive
economic justiﬁcation. Having publicly accepted the
Review’s exhortation to base policy on ‘objective evi-
dence’, the Government had placed itself in a position
where it had no choice but to attempt to make an empir-
ical economic case for the proposition that a private
copying exception could be constructed that would not
give rise to more than de minimis harm to right holders.
It did this in a series of revised impact assessments. As
Mr Justice Green observed:

The Updated Impact Assessment is the pivotal document
for the purposes of the present case since it is there that the

literature on peer review suggests almost the opposite: that standards
for deciding what is acceptable are matters of negotiation and
compromise, and that peer review is simply part of the process of
construction by which scientists certify some claims and conventions
as valid.

Thomas Dillon . Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’

ARTICLE

101

deﬁnitive reasons justifying the decision to introduce the
new Section 28B are to be found.63

Given the equivocal nature of the objective economic
evidence at the Government’s disposal, it was a short
step to the conclusion that there was no adequate object-
ive basis for the ﬁnding that a limited exception would
cause no substantial harm to right holders.

The inevitable slide from disinterested reﬂection to
political advocacy is illustrated by the detail of the judg-
ment. It reveals that in February 2014 the Motion
Picture Association of America had submitted ‘econom-
ic evidence’ to the UKIPO which was relevant to the val-
idity of the argument that right holders would suffer no
material harm as a result of a private copying exception.
However, the Impact Assessment was not amended to
take the evidence into account and no Government re-
sponse was developed.64 A converse example of such se-
lectivity can be found in the changes made to the Impact
Assessment on the private copying exception between its
ﬁrst publication in December 2012 and its re-issue in
March 2014, when the draft Statutory Instrument for
the exception was published. Among various more
minor changes, the following sentence was deleted from
the ﬁrst version of the Impact Assessment:

Research carried out by Oliver and Ohlbaum for UK Music
found that consumers place a real value on the ability to
copy music to devices, and this was found to be one of the
most valued features on portable devices.65

The Oliver and Ohlbaum report was a peer-reviewed
survey of consumer attitudes which showed that consu-
mers placed a substantial value on the ability to make
copies, including copies made to an online storage or
Cloud facility. The Government had announced that the
private copy exception would extend to copies stored by
consumers in the Cloud. The assumed state of nature
underlying the UKIPO’s argument was that copying by
consumers was not prevented and (apparently) unpreven-
table. However, this clearly did not extend to Cloud provi-
ders, who were to some extent already paying for licences
and against whom enforcement would be straightforward.
The Oliver and Ohlbaum report implied that consumers
would be willing to pay, directly or indirectly, for the facil-
ity of making copies in the Cloud, which would in turn
imply that right holders would lose more than de minimis
revenues by reason of their inability to require Cloud

providers to enter into licences for consumer private
copies. This undermined the ‘pricing-in’ theory.

Whether the deletion of this passage was motivated
by a desire to strengthen the Government’s case or was
simply an error, the instance illustrates the freedom with
which policy-makers can construct their public argu-
ments, whether or not the evidence submitted to them
complies with some pre-established standard of admissi-
bility. Thus a rule which excludes certain kinds of evidence
risks being disregarded by policy-makers themselves; and
in any event, once a proposed measure enters the legisla-
tive process it will be subject to inﬂuence from non-expert,
political sources over which ofﬁcials have no control.
In fact, as discussed below, the notion of a governmental
reliance on pure expertise proposed by the Review was a
naı¨ve reminiscence of science policy in the 1950s—
something against which Hargreaves had written at an
earlier stage of his career.

What is ‘evidence’?
Evidence is indispensable to many social practices, be
they professional, commercial, academic or governmen-
tal. Although the use of the concept may differ between
these domains, the claim of evidence on our attention is
singular: any decision which purports to be objective
must take full account of the relevant evidence. But what
is meant by ‘evidence’?

The reliability of evidence and the process of its recep-
tion have been the subject of reﬂection in the law for
centuries. However, the legal practitioner has little use
for a deﬁnition of ‘evidence’ in the abstract, and no
English statute provides one. However, Bentham, in his
Rationale of
the following
general deﬁnition:

Judicial Evidence, offers

Any matter of fact, the effect, tendency, or design of which,
when presented to the mind, is to produce a persuasion con-
cerning the existence of some other matter of fact: a persua-
sion either afﬁrmative or disafﬁrmative of its existence.66

Some jurisdictions do provide a deﬁnition even if the
English, with their lack of interest in abstraction, do not.
For example, s 140 of the California Evidence Code
provides:

‘Evidence’ means testimony, writings, material objects, or
other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove
the existence or nonexistence of a fact.

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 2

The law uses the word ‘evidence’ in several ways.
Commonly it refers not only to the material placed
before the court for purposes of proof (the statement of
a witness, a document or thing), but also the informa-
tion conveyed by that material (the facts to be inferred
from the material presented); and yet further the means
by which that material is presented (the giving of testi-
mony, the formal production of a document or object or
the presentation of an experiment).

Only relevant evidence is admissible, and there is a
certain equivocation (though no confusion) in the way
lawyers incorporate the notion of relevance within the
notion of evidence. ‘That’s not evidence’ is a traditional
objection to testimony. In a sense, all testimony is ‘evidence’,
but if it is not relevant, it is not evidence in the case at
hand—and so not evidence at all.

Rule 401 of the US Federal Rules of Evidence (‘Test

for Relevant Evidence’) provides:

Evidence is relevant if:

(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable

than it would be without the evidence; and

(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.

The evidence cannot determine what is relevant. That is
a matter of the framing of the controversy and the
process by which the decision is to be reached. The fact
that a decision has to be reached conditions the process
of reception of evidence and hence the rules, formal and
substantive, with which putative evidence must comply
in order to be taken into account.

The hallmark of evidence is rational persuasiveness.
In principle, what is persuasive is admissible. A ‘small
panel of independent scientiﬁc advisers’ is not generally
interposed between the parties and the judge. However,
certain rules apply to exclude from consideration evi-
dence which ought not, for some particular reason, to be
taken into account.

One such rule is that against the admission of opinion
evidence. The common law deems such evidence to be
inadmissible, even if the boundary between direct and
opinion evidence is difﬁcult to draw.67 An exception is
made, however, for the relevant opinion evidence of

experts. The opinion of such a witness ‘is admissible
because it is the product of a special expertise which the
trial judge is unlikely to possess and which, even if he
did, it is not his function to apply’.68 The processes
required to justify the reliance upon such evidence have
been the subject of intense reﬂection and adjustment for
many years.69

Common law jurisdictions have long attempted to
control reliance on the evidence of expert witnesses,
having regard to the risks of quackery (‘junk science’)
and misunderstanding arising from the specialized
nature of the expert’s discourse. Expert evidence is ne-
cessarily testimony which it is difﬁcult for the non-
expert to evaluate. This obstacle is compensated for by
the assurance of reliability that comes from the expert’s
prior characterization as an expert. This need not be an
expertise resulting from formal qualiﬁcations, though
such qualiﬁcations are evidence of the existence of
expertise.70

Laymen may not be qualiﬁed to say whether the
grounds of the scientist’s opinion are scientiﬁcally valid,
but are able to judge as to the heuristics of reliability—
such as the consistency of the expert’s statements, his
ability to explain himself by reference to accepted canons
of reasoning, the esteem in which he is held by other
experts or the State, the length of time during which he
has practised within his discipline and the status of his
discipline as an accepted ﬁeld of scientiﬁc or other ex-
pertise. The processes of litigation are designed to expose
such heuristics.

Who is an ‘expert’?
Expert evidence is evidence about relevant facts. Clearly,
when a pathologist says: ‘the victim died of poisoning’,
he is giving evidence of a fact. Similarly, where an econo-
mist in an anti-trust case testiﬁes that a particular cartel
has reduced competition, he is giving evidence of a fact.
However, such testimony is an interpretation of data
(certain physical conditions of the deceased; certain fea-
tures of the market for the supply of a product). This
does not make his statement anything less than a factual

70 The Australian Law Reform Commission observed:

The function of expert evidence is generally said to be the rendering
of assistance to the tribunal of fact. The means by which a witness
qualiﬁes himself to render that assistance should be no concern of the
courts once it is clearly demonstrated that that expertise in fact exists.
Moreover,
the evident bias in favour of academically acquired
expertise savours unfortunately of intellectual arrogance.

statement, but the basis of his statement is not a simple
matter of observation. He has not observed the fact to
which he testiﬁes, but rather offers an inference derived
from his observation of other facts and his knowledge of
physiology or economics. Nor can the lay tribunal dir-
ectly assess the reliability of his assertion, as it involves
either a judgment based on specialized experience or the
application of analytical methods not accessible to the
layman.

Epistemologists have in recent years carried on a vig-
orous debate about the nature of evidence, including the
notion of evidence about evidence. Their reﬁned insights
into how we should deﬁne the thing we call evidence
have limited practical relevance to the present discus-
sion. However, philosophers do generally approve the
notion that evidence about evidence—so-called higher-
order evidence—is evidence.71 And this is common
sense.

interpretation.

The rules about expert evidence are rules as to the ad-
missibility of what the law calls, in not entirely natural
language, opinion, that is to say, statements that are not
simply the rehearsal of experienced facts, but involve
some degree of
If a skilled person
observes facts (‘the litmus paper turned red’), his evi-
dence of his observations is not opinion. However,
experts are usually required to interpret what they see
(‘the solution was therefore acidic’) or to offer informa-
tion about a hypothetical, and hence by deﬁnition unob-
served condition (eg the value of an unsold asset).
Leaving aside metaphysical objections, it is a fact that the
solution was acidic. However, one cannot infer that fact
from the observed facts without some expert knowledge
that allows one to reach a conclusion about the meaning
of the observed facts.

In the USA, under Frye v United States,72 it appeared
that the existence of a body of accepted expertise was a
requirement of the admissibility of expert opinion evi-
dence. However, in Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuti-
cals, Inc,73 this factor was relegated to the status of a
element in the judicial assessment whether the expert
witness was capable of giving relevant evidence based on
a reliable foundation. The law in England is essentially
the same. The two key questions are whether study and
experience gives a witness’s opinion an authority which
the opinion of one not so qualiﬁed would lack; and, if
so, whether the witness in question is skilled and has

adequate knowledge.74 In both the UK and the USA, the
evidence of economists is frequently adduced in courts
and tribunals, where it is subjected to the same tests of
reliability and relevance as any other kind of expert
evidence.75

The law’s pondering of the relevance of a pre-existing
expert community to which the alleged expert witness
relates reﬂects an intuition as to the danger of reliance
upon individual expertise. Recent work has shown that,
in behavioural science, at least, reliance on the conclu-
sions of a single scientist or research team is risky: the
hidden subjectivities of method and data selection mean
that a wide range of different—and even opposing—
conclusions can result from the same data set.76 Yet there
is little incentive for researchers to seek to replicate the
results of published colleagues.

The authority of evidence can be characterized only
by reference to the capacity of the tribunal that must
consume it. The law, rightly in the circumstances of the
forensic process, regards the credibility of expert evi-
dence as resting upon a complex of factors, some tech-
nical, some human, which are impossible for lay people
directly to evaluate. Indeed, it is this contestability which
is really the ground for describing such evidence as
‘opinion’, even though the proposition for which such
evidence stands is normally one of objective fact. Similar
conditions apply to the evaluation of evidence by policy-
makers, who are in general laymen. Economic evidence
is in this sense opinion, rather than testimony as to un-
ambiguous, observed fact.

The value of process
The common law courts deploy a complex system, con-
stantly reﬁned, to control the reception of evidence. The
rules operate in the interests both of evidential quality
and procedural efﬁciency. The ultimate test of the evi-
dence is the adversarial trial system itself, which incorpo-
rates the conﬂicting interests of
the parties into a
dynamic process of examination, each litigant having a
strong interest in discovering the weaknesses of the
other’s case. As Jasanoff observes:

At their most effective, legal proceedings have the capacity
not only to bring to light the divergent technical under-
standings of experts but also to disclose their underlying

normative and social commitments in ways that permit in-
telligent evaluation by lay persons.77

In contrast, the policy-making process is inquisitorial
and decision-making takes place in principle out of the
public eye.

Procedural efﬁciency is of concern to the system of
justice not for purely ﬁscal reasons, but in the interests
of the quality of justice both for litigants in a given case
and for society as a whole. If trials are protracted with
excessive quantities of evidence, the tribunal’s ability to
manage the case and reach a correct conclusion is made
more difﬁcult, while the judicial resources available for
the speedy resolution of disputes between other parties
are reduced. This concern has become more explicit in
England during the late 1990s, with the introduction of
the so-called Woolf reforms. For reasons of technology
and an intensiﬁed culture of risk-aversion, the volume
of material presented to courts has increased to an
extraordinary degree since the 1980s. As a result, the
English courts have repeatedly pleaded with litigators
to control
the evidence placed before
them.78

the bulk of

In England, the Civil Procedure Rules introduced the
notion that a court could limit the introduction of evi-
dence at trial on grounds other than its admissibility, im-
posing a communitarian obligation, so to speak, on
parties to limit their recourse to the judicial system in
the interests of other litigants and the system itself.79
Rules of procedure have been developed in both the
criminal and civil jurisdictions in order to focus the at-
tention of parties and witnesses to the factors conducing
to the reliability of purported expert evidence and to
allow that expertise to be examined.80 Similarly, in the
judgment81 gave courts

Jasanoff, above, n 62, at 215. Jasanoff recognizes that adversarial
proceedings ‘can obfuscate as well advance critical enquiry’.
See eg L (A Child), Re [2015] EWFC 15 (26 February 2015).
See eg Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), Rule 32.1 (power of court to control
evidence); ibid, Rule 35.4 (court’s power to restrict expert evidence). This
is not to say that the need to control the conduct of litigation in the public
interest was new in 1997. However, the tools available to the court in
seeking to discourage excessive demands on its resources were previously
much more limited.
See eg in England and Wales: in criminal proceedings: Criminal Procedure

ministrative resources between competing activities of
government. The control of the nature and quantity of
submissions to government is an issue on which policy-
makers can learn from the legal system. There is little
procedural method today in the reception of evidence by
policy-makers, yet it is possible that the efﬁcient evalu-
ation of submissions could be improved by the adoption
of more formal systems for their reception. It would not
be unreasonable, for example, to impose a limit on the
number of pages of any submission, subject to the add-
ition of any statistical or other numerical data in the
form of an annex. This form of procedural restriction is,
of course, entirely different from the proposal advanced
by the Review to exclude certain kinds of evidence on
substantive grounds.

The need for a theoretical framework
The relevance of evidence depends on the framing of a
question. As mentioned above, the question for the
Review was to determine how the IP system might be
changed to promote economic growth in the UK. The
Review got off to a perplexing start by reformulating the
issue by reference to what it supposed to be the function
of the IP system:

We seek to understand how IPRs can fulﬁl the economic in-
centive role described in the Statute of Anne, Britain’s ﬁrst
copyright legislation, enacted in 1709 and deﬁnitively sum-
marised in the US Constitution in 1776:—‘to promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited
Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries’.83

The inﬂuence of the Copyright Clause of the US Consti-
tution on thinking about IP has been unduly restrictive,
even in countries other than the US. It has been
assumed, as the Review assumed, that the ‘promotion of
the progress and useful arts’ was to be achieved by redu-
cing ‘the risk in inventing and creating new products’.84
To be fair to the drafters of the US Constitution, the
Copyright Clause does not say that the promotion of the
useful Arts is to be achieved through the incentivization

of authors’ works, were indeed tangential to the issue as
deﬁned by the Review.

Having thus set up creation as the justiﬁcation for IP
rights,86 the Review counterposed the alleged costs to
society and the economy resulting from the blocking of
access to valuable technology or content, the creation of
transaction costs, the prevention of competition and the
raising of prices. But where was the burden of proof?
Was it the Review’s starting point on copyright that a
case had to be made for any change to the status quo or
rather that existing rules had to be justiﬁed anew if they
were not to be changed? Given the fact that the Review
stated that there was ‘next to no evidence on copyright
policy’, but went on to make extensive recommendations
for changes to copyright law, the burden of proof must
implicitly have lain upon the defenders of the status
quo.87

The framing of the issue necessarily takes place within
rules of decision. In litigation the principal rules are the
burden of proof and the standard of proof. The former
establishes which party to a dispute must persuade the
tribunal to take a ﬁnal position on an issue. The oper-
ation of the burden of proof
in court proceedings
depends on both a procedural rule (the order in which
the parties are required to present their evidence) and
decisional rules (has a prima facie case been presented at
the close of the prosecution’s or plaintiff ’s case? At the
close of evidence, has the accusation or claim been
proved to the required standard of proof?).

Thus in order to prove a criminal offence under s
92(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994, the prosecutor has
the burden, for example, of proving the accused’s act
of applying a sign likely to be mistaken for a registered
trade mark to goods within the scope of the registra-
tion without the proprietor’s consent, and the accu-
sed’s culpable intention, namely to make a gain for
himself or another, or to cause loss to another. The es-

86 This reductive assumption about the purpose of copyright is

commonplace in the writing of economists, despite the fact that it has
long ceased to be uniformly regarded by legal writers and the courts as an
adequate explanation even of its economic function: see eg Harper & Row,
Publishers, Inc v Nation Enters, 471 US 539 (1985). On the market-
structural function of intellectual property, see EW Kitch ‘The Nature and
Function of the Patent System’ (1977) 20 JL & Econ 265; FS Kieff
‘Property Rights and Property Rules for Commercializing Inventions’
(2000) 85 Minn L Rev 697. For a hostile (yet persuasive) explication of the
development of the ‘Law and Economics’ models of copyright, see NW
Netanel ‘Copyright and a Democratic Civil Society’ (1996) 106(2) Yale LJ
283.

tablishment of these facts entitles the prosecutor to ask
the court to convict the accused. However, the accused
can negate that prima facie entitlement by proving
that ‘he believed on reasonable grounds that the use of
the sign in the manner in which it was used, or was to
be used, was not an infringement of the registered
trade mark’.

This transfer of the burden of proof from prosecutor
to defendant takes place within a linear process. The
prosecutor must ﬁrst put forward a prima facie case. It is
only if there is evidence on which, if uncontradicted, a
conviction might properly be based that the burden of
proof passes to the defendant to prove the statutory
defence.88 Subject to such statutory interventions, the
common law places the burden of proof on the prosecu-
tion from start to ﬁnish.89

The standard of proof sets the degree to which the de-
liberator must be persuaded in order to ﬁnd in favour of
a proving party on an issue or set of issues. In criminal
proceedings in the common law world, the judge or jury
must typically be persuaded ‘so that it is sure’ or, in the
traditional and more explanatory formulation, ‘beyond
reasonable doubt’.90 However, where a burden of proof
lies upon the defendant in criminal proceedings, the test
of persuasion is typically ‘on the balance of probabilities’
or, in the American formulation, ‘on a preponderance of
the evidence’. In other words, the tribunal must be per-
suaded that the proposition advanced is on the evidence
more likely to be true than not. The criminal and civil
standards appear to be the only available standards of
proof in English trials.91

Why does the law go to such lengths to deﬁne its de-
liberative process? Surely because of the law’s need for
‘decisive endings’.92 A decision has to be achieved with
a reasonable degree of conﬁdence within a relatively
short timescale. The world of policy is similar, as the
period of less than six months given to Prof Hargreaves
to complete the Review exempliﬁes. In science, it is
otherwise. If there is no conclusion, the work in prin-

87 Hargreaves Review, above, n 2, para 2.6.
88 The accused may dispute the facts alleged by the prosecutor. In doing so
he is under no burden of proof. The burden remains on the prosecutor.
Where the statute expressly provides a ground of defence, the defendant
must raise and prove it: R v Hunt [1987] AC 352.

89 Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1; the only common law exception

being that a defence of insanity must be established by the accused: Daniel

In the USA, as formerly in England, other standards of proof apply in
special cases, such as the requirement of ‘clear and convincing evidence’.

ciple must continue. However, in policy-making there
is little of the legal system’s painstaking formulation of
issues and structured, sequential presentation of evi-
dence.

Independence
The Review had identiﬁed a major obstacle to good
policy in the prevalence of ‘lobbynomics’, as opposed to
‘independently veriﬁed research conclusions’. In other
words, the provider of evidence must not have a material
interest in the outcome of the debate.

The evidence given by witnesses may be affected by
bias or interest. Bias is straightforward: someone who
consciously favours a particular party or point of view
will tend to present facts in a way consistent with that
preference and may even lie. Interest is more subtle. A
witness whose interest in fact depends on a certain state
of affairs will often unconsciously interpret facts in a way
that protects or advances that interest.

While it is recognized—in the English law of evi-
dence at least—that an interest does not disqualify an
expert from claiming relevant expertise, the processes
of the court are designed to impress upon the expert
the need to strive for objectivity.93 Thus in England the
Civil Procedure Rules provide that expert evidence
‘should be the independent product of the expert un-
inﬂuenced by the pressures of
litigation’ and that
experts ‘should assist the court by providing objective,
unbiased opinions on matters within their expertise,
and should not assume the role of an advocate’. An
expert witness is required to sign a statement that he
‘understands [his] duty to the court, and has complied
with that duty’.94

That those who seek ‘evidence’ should have strong
preconceptions is not necessarily a bad thing. As Polanyi
observes:

The surmises of a working scientist are born of the imagin-
ation seeking discovery. Such effort risks defeat but never
seeks it; it is in fact his craving for success that makes the sci-
entist take the risk of failure. There is no other way. Courts
of law employ two separate lawyers to argue opposite pleas,
because it is only by a passionate commitment to a particu-
lar view that the imagination can discover the evidence that
supports it.95

Bias or interest can affect the submissions of a commer-
cial concern, which inevitably will propose facts and
arguments calculated to support what it supposes to be
its commercial interest. This interest may be assumed to
be tied to a sincere opinion that the economic prospects
of the company in question will be positively affected by
the acceptance of the facts and arguments proposed.
While such motivations may not make the disclosure of
research more likely in every case, commercial compan-
ies are generally driven by the need to maximize proﬁts
and one would expect them to save themselves the ﬁnan-
cial and political costs of lobbying on issues which they
had reason to believe did not affect their revenues. Busi-
nesses will thus conduct themselves in accordance with
their own, credible research, whether it is published or
not. Public veriﬁability is not a necessary condition of
the persuasiveness of conclusions based on conﬁdential
research, so long as the reasons for non-publication of
underlying data are credible.

It hardly needs saying that IP policy has become an
ideological battleground, connected as it is with im-
portant social, cultural and economic issues. Academics
participate in the politics of IP law to a remarkable
degree, using their academic platforms to express
sweeping and sometimes passionate views.96 Such com-
mentators are not immune from the risks of emotional
commitment; and those who advocate on behalf of in-
dustry, from whatever side, may also carry a distorting
burden of sincerity. It is important not to confuse two
reasons for disbelieving the evidence of certain wit-
nesses. Their evidence may be impossible to evaluate,
because essential data are not disclosed or disclosable or
the witness may simply be of untrustworthy character, a
dishonest person.

Academics are no less vulnerable to the scrutiny of
public choice theory than any other institution of public
life.97 Academic careers may depend on the obtaining of
public funding for projects. As Solesbury drily observes,
the commitment to evidence-based policy ‘does provide
an astonishing new opportunity for researchers in ma-
terial, intellectual and political terms’.98 If a research de-
partment is to secure ofﬁcial (or private) funding or
merely an ofﬁcial platform for the publicization of its
ideas, it has an incentive not to stray very far from what
it perceives to be the philosophical position of its patron.

Thomas Dillon . Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’

ARTICLE

107

Hence academics do not enjoy an a priori status of inde-
pendence. The notion that one could appoint an ‘inde-
pendent panel of scientiﬁc experts’ to sift submissions in
a way which would produce legitimate policy conclu-
sions appears rather unsophisticated.

What is evidence-based policy making?
The rational structure of the Review’s proposal in favour
of ‘evidence driven policy’ was not obvious. Government
was told that it was ‘vital that economic considerations
are fully weighed in the balance’; but also informed that
‘a public debate shaped by a desire to provide creators
with a “just reward” rather than by hard economics’ was
‘no longer satisfactory in the light of the growing im-
portance of the creative industries in the UK economy
and the spread of copyright’s impact across business
sectors outside the creative industries’.99 Was the desire
to provide a ‘just reward’ to be weighed in the balance or
not? And, if so, how?

‘Evidence-based policy’ was a well-established doc-
trine by the time of the Review’s appearance in 2011,
and one would have assumed that the Review’s promin-
ent use of the concept would indicate some continuity
with the voluminous learning on the subject. From the
late 1990s onwards in the UK health sector, and then in
wider ﬁelds of social policy, advocates of ‘evidence-based
policy’ promoted the value of the systematic review
of existing research evidence directly or tangentially
relevant to a problem. ‘Like all of the best ideas, the big
idea here is a simple one—that research should pass on
collective wisdom about the successes and failures of
previous initiatives in particular policy domains.’100
Thus the critical expertise required was not that of the
medical (or other subject-matter) expert, with his real
world experiments, but the synthesizing skills of the in-
formation scientist.

The UKIPO’s published principles on evidence for
policy contrasted in their brevity with the pre-existing
ofﬁcial guidance on the same issue, such as the UK
Treasury’s ‘Green Book’, not to mention the substantial
critical literature on the subject.101 Notably, the Green
Book insists on the importance of distributional analysis.

Where a project aims at improving economic efﬁciency
by correcting market failure (arguably a function of IP
law) ‘equity outcomes’ must also be considered.102

In fact evidence-based policy making has for many
years been under critical ﬁre, especially in its medical
homeland, by reference in particular to the question
how to cumulate quantitative evidence with qualitative;
and the implicit exclusion of the views and experiences
of non-researcher participants in the health system (a
problem which the Review’s proscription of non-eco-
nomic evidence at once evokes).103 In the medical ﬁeld,
Glasby (2008) argues for ‘knowledge-based practice’ as
opposed to ‘evidence-based practice’, pointing out that
different academic disciplines have different notions of
evidence.104 He shows that the theoretical framework for
research is affected by considerations (such as assump-
tions about what is normal or appropriate) which can be
revealed only by qualitative research. Pawson argues that
‘[r]esearch synthesis operates through processes of policy
abstraction and theory-building rather than data extrac-
tion and number crunching’.105

Sociology of expertise
The objective of policy-making is not simply to make a
decision which is technically correct, but to produce an
outcome (which may be a decision not to act) which
so far as possible satisﬁes all relevant interests. Evidence
which is ‘good’ for policy must be good for the policy-
making process.

In the 1950s and 1960s, ‘the sciences were thought of
as esoteric as well as authoritative’, and it was assumed
that legitimate decision making simply involved the
communication of the conclusions of experts.106 In this
period, scientists were treated as having authority even
when talking about subjects outside their speciﬁc ﬁeld of
knowledge, presumably on the theory that the ability to
apply the scientiﬁc method was a token of intelligence
and of an understanding of the general processes of
nature. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, academic study
of science came to recognize that the nature of science
and the role of scientists in society were not adequately
captured by simple technocratic notions.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 2

Brian Wynne’s study of Cumbrian sheep farmers ex-
empliﬁes the discoveries of this school of social sci-
ence.107 Following the accident that took place in 1986 at
the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine, upland
sheep farms in the English Lake District were contami-
nated with radioactive isotopes. Scientists advised that
the effects of the contamination would last only few
weeks, but that in the meantime, a ban had to be placed
on the movement and slaughter of sheep from affected
areas. After six weeks, however, the Government anno-
unced an indeﬁnite ban, which severely damaged the
farmers. As it turned out, the farmers had valuable
knowledge about the husbandry of sheep that, if recog-
nized by the scientists, might have prevented or at least
minimized the errors that led to the abrupt change of
policy. At the same time, the disregard shown by the
Ministry scientists to the farmers undermined the local
credibility of their advice. Farmers were profoundly alie-
nated from the processes of the Ministry of Agriculture
and disbelieving of its conclusions, widely preferring to
believe that the contamination resulted from the nearby
Sellaﬁeld nuclear plant.

As Wynne points out, the implicit denigration of the
farmers’ expertise was experienced as an attack on their
identity, and thus produced a strong emotional reaction.
It is not fanciful to see a similar process at work in the
negative reactions of the copyright industries to the pro-
cesses and conclusions of the Review.

capable of discerning and which the public must be edu-
cated to comprehend.’110

‘Science’ never comes into the witness box or before
the committee of enquiry. There are only scientists. It is
not enough for scientiﬁc knowledge to be ‘correct’, it
must also be acknowledged as credible and authoritative:

We regard a particular factual claim as true not because it
accurately reﬂects what is out there in nature, but because it
has been certiﬁed as true by those who are considered com-
petent to pass upon the truth and falsity of that kind of
claim.111

To this extent, scientiﬁc knowledge is socially con-
structed. However, the sociology of science advances a
further postulate, namely that value judgements, and
hence politics, are pervasive in the interaction of science
and policy making and within the conclusions of scien-
tists themselves:

There is a forced linearity in the . . . suggestion that, once the
politics of a situation have been properly sorted out, the
‘real’ science can proceed, independent of further political
inﬂuence. Insulation of this kind is simply unthinkable if,
wherever one cuts into the decision-making processes, one
ﬁnds a hybridization of science and politics as these terms
are conventionally understood. Nor is there an objective
Archimedean point from which an all-seeing agent can de-
termine who belongs, and who does not, with the magic
circle of expertise.112

As Wynne had observed in earlier work:

As Hargreaves observed in 2001:

The demand for ‘hard facts’ alone excludes debate about the
interpretive social frameworks within which those facts have
meaning. Those who deﬁne the facts also give them political
meaning, deﬁning alternative perspectives as irrational
rather than as legitimate competitors.108

In this research, science was ‘reconceptualized as a social
activity’109 and it was observed that the legitimacy of
policy decisions based on science requires the acceptance
by the public of the authority of scientists. But these
lessons have been slow to ﬁlter through to scientists as
well as policy-makers. As Hargreaves observed in 2001 in
the ﬁeld of relations between scientists and the media:
‘Too many scientists still behave as if there is something
called “truth” or “the facts” which they possess or are

all media, including specialist scientiﬁc media, must be read
more carefully, for the assumptions of the author and the
audience and for their context.113

Examples of the intrusion of value judgments are many
in the speculations that follow the conclusions of econo-
mists about the results of their particular, narrow enqui-
ries. Thus Pollock, having built a theoretical argument
for a short term of copyright protection, based on a
series of assumptions not only about the purpose and
functioning of copyright, but also as to the declining
value of rights over time, concludes his arithmetic with a
real-world political programme:

. . . current copyrights are almost certainly too long. This
implies that there is a signiﬁcant role for policymakers to

improve social welfare by reducing copyright term as well as
indicating that existing terms should not be extended.114

To take a further example, Kretschmer examines earn-
ings data from authors, ﬁnding that a few authors earn
much more than the rest, and concludes that a small
number of very high earning authors and artists ‘earn a
disproportionate share of total income’, but also that
‘copyright law does not matter’ for the ‘independence
and dignity’ of artistic creators and performers.115
Mitra-Kahn casually repeats the sentiment. He observes:
‘the top 10% of creators receive a disproportionately
large share of the total income’.116 By what measure, one
might ask, are the revenues of a popular author to be
judged proportionate as against those of an unpopular
author? No argument is advanced to justify these moral
judgments. The welfare economist would have to accept
that greater utility is achieved through the sale of a
million copies of The Da Vinci Code than of a thousand
copies of the output of any winner of the Nobel Prize for
Literature.

Ironically, Mitra-Kahn goes on to criticize ‘the grey
literature’ for focusing on the aggregate impact: ‘there is
usually little consideration for distribution from poor-
to-rich or alive-to-dead’.117 Yet, as noticed above, IP
scholars routinely elide the question of redistribution
from authors to users. Professor Towse pertinently
observes that it is ‘noticeable throughout the Hargreaves
report that the focus is on beneﬁts to users rather than
to the “primary content creators”’.118

The trouble with economics
The Review’s mission was to examine how IP could con-
tribute to economic growth and innovation. It sought
to estimate the economic consequences of its recom-
mendations, the acceptance of which was justiﬁed by the
Government on the basis of the contribution of the pro-

ate data and the methodological problem created by the
ubiquity of copyright.119

The layman might imagine that ‘economic evidence’
would be evidence about the economy of one or more
nations. However,
few economists writing on IP
squarely address the issue which the Review was
created to consider: how to promote growth through
IP policy. As Towse states: ‘First and foremost of what
we don’t know is the overall impact that copyright law
has on the economy, the very thing that policy-makers
seek’.120

Subject to well-established concerns about hidden
assumptions and pervasive non-replication, economic
evidence as to the business effects of IP, based on
repeated empirical studies, would clearly be of value to
policy-makers.121 Such descriptive research would
assist policy-makers in their deliberations as to the
best method of increasing wealth in society. However,
many economists writing on IP operate within the
framework of ‘welfare economics’.122 This kind of nor-
mative analysis does not seek to address the issue of
economic growth, but rather the achievement of the
‘best’ outcome for society. It is important not to
confuse economic observations about the operation of
the money economy with the prescriptions of welfare
economics.

Economists have long debated the precise deﬁnition
of welfare, but the general principle is well understood
and generally adopted. For present purposes it is neces-
sary to refer only to the foundational notion of Pareto
efﬁciency. According to this notion, a state of society
maximizes social welfare when the largest possible
number of people have what they want—that is to say,
that it is impossible to make any person ‘better off ’
without making another person ‘worse off ’. Welfare
economists essentially seek to compare different distri-
butions of resources against the measure of Pareto efﬁ-
ciency. However, such analysis does not distinguish
between different, equally efﬁcient Pareto-efﬁcient dis-
tributions. A policy prescription based on welfare eco-

nomics involves a distributional judgment that welfare
economics cannot supply.123

Nor does welfare economics decide whether the
maximization of individual welfare is in fact beneﬁcial
to society as a whole (or even for the individuals con-
cerned), still less whether it is ethically justiﬁed.124 In
the ﬁeld of medicine, the criteria of success are more
concrete and focus on actual welfare (did the patient
survive for longer or enjoy a better quality of life?),
‘welfare’ of
rather
welfare economics. In this usage,
‘welfare’ is a mis-
nomer: welfare economics is really the economics of
social preferences.

than the unquantiﬁed, ordinal

By way of example, in a 2004 article on the effects of
ﬁle sharing by students, Rob and Waldfogel use survey
data on willingness-to-pay to try to quantify welfare
gains and losses.125 The authors state:
‘we ﬁnd that
downloading reduces their per capita expenditure (on
hit albums released 1999– 2003) from $126 to $100 but
raises per capita consumer welfare by $70’.126 Their ana-
lysis suggested ‘that some of the surplus enjoyed by
downloaders would otherwise have been the deadweight
loss associated with a foregone but socially beneﬁcial
transaction’.127

This exempliﬁes what we do and do not learn from a
welfare analysis. To put it crudely, record companies lose
$26-worth of sales per ﬁle sharer, but ﬁle sharers acquire
$70-worth of music. According to the perspective
expressed in the article, the positive difference represents
a social beneﬁt and presumably therefore should inﬂu-
ence the decision,
for example, whether to apply
resources in enforcement.128 However, such conclusions
do not tell us the effect of the status quo on the level of
wealth in the economy, let alone its moral acceptabil-

ity.129 Nor does such economic evidence generally con-
sider what the situation would be in another state of
nature, such as one in which copyright was more effect-
ively protected.130

The inability of welfare economics based on some
concept of Pareto efﬁciency to address the distribution-
al effects of policy or to integrate moral considerations
is well-understood, and not regarded as a difﬁculty by
economists: the tax system can be used to address any
distributional inequities created by policies which are
Pareto efﬁcient.131 Whatever its merits in other areas,
however, this is a weak answer in the ﬁeld of law. First,
a distribution based on preferences (or ‘welfare’) clearly
incorporates deontological sentiments, even if the method
of welfare economics is incapable of revealing them.
Secondly, the Pareto calculus implies a host of precon-
ceptions as to the relationship between the individual,
society and the material world. Indeed, as Anne Barron
has demonstrated, while sharing unexamined notions
of social order, economists disagree about the function
of copyright on grounds essentially of political senti-
ment which their discipline seemingly does not equip
them to express.132 More prosaically, the social beneﬁt
of the welfare economist does not accrue to any par-
ticular society or state, but rather to a notional, global
society extrapolated from the behaviour of a local
sample.

The politician’s approach, as vividly illustrated by the
process of the Hargreaves Review, is to ask how policy
can increase wealth, not welfare, in the speciﬁc state in
which he exercises responsibility, it being assumed that
the distributional results of greater wealth will be looked
after by the existing structure of society, including its
political system.

(1998) 146(5) U Philadelphia L Rev 1419.

129 As Shavell observes with approbation: ‘the standard normative criterion

studied in welfare economics is a social welfare function: a function of the
utilities of individuals in the population. Total wealth is not a function of
the utilities of individuals’: Shavell, above, n 122, 668.

128 According to a thorough welfare economic perspective, the assessment of
the welfare effect would have to take into account the value of money to
the parties to the transfer of consumer surplus. A dollar is worth more to
a poor student than to a rich record company: see J Aldred (2010)
‘Copyright and the Limits Of Law-and-Economics Analysis’ in L Bently,
J Davis and JC Ginsburg (eds) Copyright and Piracy: An Interdisciplinary

preferences of their fellow citizens, let alone those of citizens of other

study in itself, but a response to an economic argument) that all parties
seem to have taken it as a given that the prevention of private copying was
impossible. Even if it was a practical reality in the UK in 2015, it was not
an immutable truth, whether from a legal or a technological perspective,
let alone a necessary one.

131 Shavell, above, n 122, 647 ff. It is hard to see this as an adequate defence of

the welfare principle when the issue in question is intrinsically
distributional; that is to say, the reason why the issue arises is the question
whether, for example, a surplus ought to be transferred from the producer
to the consumer – or an intermediary.

Thomas Dillon . Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’

ARTICLE

111

The opinion of a businessman can be
evidence
This is not to say that political judgment cannot be
informed by economic theory and, when sufﬁciently
robust, empirical economic observations. However, such
perspectives cannot conclude the normative debate, even
within the economic sphere: relevant, persuasive evi-
dence about the behaviour of the market for copyright
products can come from non-expert sources.

One intention of the Review’s new deﬁnition of
evidence was to exclude the impressionistic views of
businessmen as to the effects of policy on their liveli-
hoods.133 The kind of anecdotal evidence accepted by
previous reviews, from publisher Alexander Macmillan’s
account of a conversation with William Wordsworth134
to the views of ‘celebrities’, should no longer be relied
upon. However, science studies provide a rationale for
paying at least some heed to the views of such ‘non-certi-
ﬁed’ experts.

Even if submission to the persuasions of celebrities
(if it ever really occurred) can hardly be justiﬁed, the
Review’s dismissal of the value of lay opinions seems to
rest on a rather unnuanced notion of the nature of
knowledge. Michael Polanyi developed the notion of
‘tacit knowledge’, noting its indispensability to human
activity and insisting on its ineffable nature.135 It is a
topic which has been discussed in the literature relating
to many different ﬁelds, including business innovation136
and evidence-based medicine.137 Tacit knowledge is inex-
plicit and unsystematic, but actual. It may consist of a
skill such as, in Polanyi’s example, the knowledge how to
ride a bicycle. It may consist in an understanding of
‘how things work’ as a matter of experience. The holders
of such knowledge are ‘uncertiﬁed’, in the sense that they
lack the kind of formal marker of expertise acquired by
academics through their participation in the institution-
al functions of universities or by practitioners of the
recognized professions, such as medicine, accountancy
or engineering.

There are many ﬁelds in which we rightly rely on the
opinion of experienced people, especially as to the prob-

able consequences of decisions made under conditions
of uncertainty. We might ask an experienced estate agent
whether a particular property is likely to attract tenants.
We can safely do this because, ﬁrst, we take the opinion
for what it is, namely a prediction, not a statement of
objective fact (something that can often be said about
the conclusions of economists); and secondly we know
that the expert has experience of the material facts,
whether or not he can give an explanation of them.

In such a situation, we believe that the expert has
internalized, so to speak, the system on which the
outcome depends and has therefore a subconscious
model from which to draw conclusions. This is why
most people would not ask an astrologer the same ques-
tions. The estate agent operates within the system. He
can reliably hypothesize how he would act in the
given situation. The estate agent’s thought experiment
(‘could I let this ﬂat and, if so, for what rent?’) provides
useful, albeit hypothetical, data about the behaviour of
actors in the market. Indeed, sometimes evidence of
this inexplicit kind is the only type that is usefully avail-
able.138

Hence it is not surprising that in passing off and trade
mark infringement cases courts admit the opinion evi-
dence of businessmen as to the risk of confusion
between the goods of claimant and defendant. In Soda-
stream v Thorn Cascade, for example, Kerr LJ said:

it is perfectly proper and admissible for someone in the
trade to express opinions about the likely reaction of others
in relation to matters which are within his or her sphere of
work; indeed, it is part of their responsibility to form a view
on such matters.139

The fact that the witness might be unable to offer any
objective analysis to justify his conclusion does not
deprive it of value. Indeed, in trade mark and passing off
cases the English courts seem increasingly to favour such
evidence over attempts to conduct scientiﬁc surveys.140
In the phrase of Michael Polanyi, ‘we can know more
than we can tell’.141

It follows that the position of ‘evidence of the trade’ is
much the same as that of the expert witness. If the holder

133 We presumably can leave aside the implicit suggestion that such opinions

137 See eg R Flynn et al (2012) ‘Embodied, Embedded and Encoded

would be dishonest: dishonest opinions are not ‘evidence’. There have
been enough cases of academic dishonesty to make this a risk of general
application.

of tacit knowledge cannot wholly express his knowledge,
notwithstanding its relevance, that knowledge is as resist-
ant to inspection by the layman as the knowledge of the
expert at the heart of his expertise. The courts in England,
at least, will permit an expert witness, including an expert
in economics, to advance a subjective, experience-based
judgment where statistical certainty cannot be shown.142
The question is whether the evidence of the witness pro-
vides assistance to the trier of fact which would not other-
wise be accessible and offers sufﬁcient external features of
reassurance to justify taking it into consideration. The
making of reasonable, subjective judgments is often the
only way of bridging the gap between the known facts and
the problem at hand.

Legitimacy
That the opinion of lay witnesses should generally be
excluded in litigation is understandable in the interests
of legitimacy and due process (that is, the fact that the
decision must be made by the lawful tribunal, not a
third party) and the possibility of appellate review. As
Learned Hand pointed out, to the extent the jury defers
to any opinion, even that of an expert, it is surrendering
its constitutional responsibility.143 In the ﬁeld of policy,
the same issue arises as a matter of democratic principle.
Where the decision is ultimately to be made at a political
level, the demands of legitimacy are served through
democratic processes, public debate and, ultimately, the
supervision of the rationality of the decision by the
courts.

Further, arguments expressed mathematically or in the
jargon of statistics are not readily understood by non-
economists. Numbers have such an authority that they are
treated with much more respect than arguments based
merely in simple language. Laymen do not tend to interro-
gate them and errors may or may not be detected.144

There have been decades of sociological reﬂection
about the relationship between the objective sciences
and policy-making. These studies are concerned with the
effectiveness and social
science-based
policy-making.

legitimacy of

Collins and Evans explain that the core expertise that
uncovers scientiﬁc knowledge (‘contributory expert-
ise’), which may belong to either certiﬁed or non-certi-

ﬁed, experience-based experts, cannot result in a valid
policy decision unless someone with ‘interactional ex-
pertise’ is able to translate the contributory expertise
into a politically consumable form. They also observe
that the extent to which experts can claim legitimacy
for their policy conclusions is a function of the degree
of general acceptance of their ideas. So recommenda-
tions based on conventional Newtonian physics,
if
answering the political concerns of the public, have le-
gitimacy. Where the science is still solidifying, such as
that relating to the environmental effects of genetically
modiﬁed organisms, non-experts will exercise a more
persuasive claim to participate in decision-making. It is
surely clear that the economics of copyright is in the
second category.

In the 2012 discussion on evidence for copyright
policy recorded in the Proceedings145 we see a contest
between the Hargreaves notion of the expert as gatekeep-
er, ﬁltering the putative evidence before policy making is
attempted and a traditional (albeit slightly post-moder-
nized) acceptance that anything potentially persuasive
must be available for consideration. For this reason,
quite apart from the risk of ideological capture, the sug-
gestion recorded by Towse and Kretschmer that a ‘small
panel of independent scientiﬁc advisers’146 would ﬁlter
evidence for acceptability would risk diminishing the le-
gitimacy of policy decisions.

As the social scientists have demonstrated, non-certi-
ﬁed experts can contribute both to the quality and to the
legitimacy of policy decisions. Accordingly, Collins and
Evans would:

. . . encourage the involvement of experience-based experts
earlier in the game – possibly by encouraging such groups
to look for spokespersons with interactional expertise in the
science in question, or to encourage the growth of inter-
mediary groups to speak for the scientiﬁc knowledge of the
uncertiﬁed, not as campaigners, nor as experts themselves,
but as translators.147

It is in fact lobbyists, such as trade associations, that
fulﬁl this function in developed countries. Without
them, the voice of experience-based experts might be shut
out from the policy discussion, in favour of experts who
have acquired some (not necessarily relevant) certiﬁcation.

Thomas Dillon . Evidence, policy and ‘evidence for policy’

ARTICLE

113

On policy and persuasion: a ﬁnal word
The Review’s insistence on ‘objective evidence’ and
‘measurable economic objectives’ seemed to envisage
that subjective judgment should so far as possible be
excluded from the policy process. Even for those who
would accept the Review’s unnuanced conception of
scientiﬁc objectivity, the idea that one can make progress
in policy-making without subjective judgment about
matters of fact must seem implausible. It was the UK
Government’s acceptance of
the Review’s objective
policy-making programme and its own political com-
mitment against levies that led it to cast its case for the
private copying exception in a form that was immediate-
ly vulnerable to judicial deconstruction.

Policy advances through a series of approximations,
with improvements guided by experience and theory.
While sound a priori reasoning based on the nature of
incentives and the potential effects of
transaction
costs
indisputably of value in assessing policy
options, the efforts of economists to provide policy
guidance based on empirical study seem not as yet to
have justiﬁed the dispositive role envisaged for them
by the Review.

is

Given that research seldom yields a clear-cut policy
imperative, the conclusions of any research paper are
often a set of informed speculations as to the import of
collateral measurements of
the phenomenon under
examination. Pawson observes:

The inﬂuence of research on policy occurs through the
medium of ideas rather than of data . . . Research is un-
likely to produce the thumping ‘fact’ that changes the
course of policy-making. Rather, there are many days of
reckoning and it is through general direction and back-
ground’ that research makes its impression. Policies are
born out of the clash and compromise of ideas, and the
key to enlightenment is to insinuate research results into
this reckoning.148

Evidence-based policy making—that is, actual produc-
tion of policy, rather than academic rumination about
it—is more a matter of inductive sense-making than the
clinical trial of speciﬁc hypotheses.

Good evidence for policy is evidence which can be
consumed in a way which neutralizes the politics of the

suppliers of evidence and achieves so far as possible the
objectives of all those with a stake in the outcome. A
comparison with the processes of the courts suggests
that the problems of independence and manageability
are issues of process rather than content. A process of
evaluation relying upon adversarial, structured debate
and the imposition of limits on the volume of submis-
sions would go a considerable way towards addressing
the problems described by Mitra-Kahn.

A ‘triangular’ system of policy evaluation which
allowed opposing interests to challenge one another
before the decision-maker might expose bias and in-
accuracy more rapidly and effectively than the present
direct, ‘spoke and wheel’ ﬂow of information from mul-
tiple interests to Government. Public disputation could
also conduce to greater public participation and hence
support the legitimacy of the outcome. In other words,
it might be worth experimenting with adversarial public
hearings based on formal exchanges of proposals and
evidence to test rival contentions.

The Review’s new exclusionary principle and the
aggressive manner of its expression can be interpreted
as self-consciously political interventions.149 Certainly
it was astute to seek to put
the likely opponents
the Review’s recommendations out of court.150
of
However, in its assumption of the intrinsic authority
of certiﬁed scientists its doctrine was a throwback to
the simplistic technocracy of the post-war period. As
we learn from the social science scholarship, such an
approach was calculated to diminish, rather than
enhance,
the public legitimacy of resultant policy
decisions.

The idea that the evidence of economists should be
the dominant component of evidence for policy seems,
on examination, problematic. Such evidence struggles to
satisfy the needs of the time-bound policy process for
‘decisive endings’. It cannot (or at least is not adapted to)
provide complete answers to the national economic,
let alone the social and ethical, questions on which IP
policy depends. Such research plays a valid part in policy
making rather ‘as an instrument of the democratic
process than of the decision-making process’.151 We
could seek to establish a policy-making process that
steers away ‘from the narrow instrumentalism of “evi-
