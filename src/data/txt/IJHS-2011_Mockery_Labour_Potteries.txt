This paper focuses upon the Potteries region in Staffordshire, UK and offers an
examination of the ways in which people living there are actively and critically
engaging with processes of identity and meaning-making. The overarching aim
of the paper is to extend the analysis of labour history originally developed by
Smith (2006) in Uses of Heritage by examining the processes of identity and
meaning-making at a range of museums/visitor centres. Like Smith’s work, the
paper rests upon the analysis of one-to-one social surveys with visitors to the
Gladstone Potteries Museum. The questions asked were designed to capture a
range of responses regarding motivations for visiting, understandings of heri-
tage, identity and memory work, audience interpretations and the validation and/
or rejection of intended messages.

Introduction
The linking of ‘heritage’ as a solution for overcoming economic depression and
community fragmentation with areas suffering the effects of deindustrialisation has a
strong presence in UK public policy. This therapeutic characterisation of heritage –
as a means of procuring social well-being and cohesion – remains strikingly promi-
nent, and is regularly cited in publications by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport, and English Heritage (see Waterton 2010). A central assumption underpinning
this linkage is that those areas characterised as ‘post-industrial’ will be lacking in
identity and cohesion without the implementation of explicit reclamation and regen-
eration policies and practices that target heritage or ‘the built environment’. The Pot-
teries, an area deﬁned by industry and primarily remembered for its involvement in
ceramics, iron, steel and the Staffordshire coalﬁelds, is a place commonly brought to
mind during such discussions, where it is imagined as lacking in self-worth, con-
structive identities and senses of belonging. Indeed, as a number of academics and
policymakers have asserted, the Potteries has become ‘a byword for obsolescence’
(see Edensor 2000, p. 10), a culture that is ‘self-mocking’ (Cowley 1999, p. 7), and
an area lacking in ‘things for people to talk about’ (Hansard 2007, c. 562). What is
particularly unsettling about this characterisation is that very little academic work
has ever been done on the Potteries as a region – sociologically or in terms of its

heritage. More signiﬁcantly, no empirical work has been done that incorporates a line
of questioning that asks about the direct experiences of people living in the area. As
a counterpoint to such arguments, this paper offers an investigation of how memory
and identity are sought, articulated and inscribed upon a particular heritage space
within the Potteries, using engagement processes communicated by visitors at the
Gladstone Potteries Museum. This approach was chosen because, as Pitchford
(1995, p. 36, cited in Pretes 2002, p. 440) notes, sites of heritage tourism can tell us
as much about the messages a group wants to broadcast about themselves, their lived
experiences and emotional lives in the present as it does about their history. Concep-
tually, this study takes its lead from the work of Laurajane Smith (2006) and, bor-
rowing from her re-theorisation of heritage, suggests that important and meaningful
cultural work is undertaken in this area, particularly in relation to its industrial his-
tory and not only in terms of understanding the past. The presumed absence of
engaged heritage work in de-industrialised areas, I argue, stands at odds with the
active and critical engagement isolated at the museum included in this study. Quite
the contrary, this is a museum used by visitors to position themselves in the present,
sometimes using its displays to critically engage with contemporary social and politi-
cal issues of exclusion, while at other times using them to make sense of more mun-
dane processes of negotiating self, home and community. In short, it is a history that
still holds the capacity to evoke emotions that help people describe their experiences
of place.

Heritage, the working classes and inclusion
The rationale for this study emerges out of three distinct narratives associated with the
heritage literature:
 The prevalence of an authorised heritage discourse, as identiﬁed by Laurajane
 Heritage industry critiques, particularly those associated with Patrick Wright
 Recent attempts to foster inclusion within the heritage sector.

and Robert Hewison.

Smith.

All three narratives have combined to create a situation in which working class
heritage is somehow seen as inferior, or operating outside of the parameters of what is
accepted as heritage in a policy sense. This issue is compounded by the addition of a
focus on inclusion, which appears to have adopted, whole-heartedly, Wright’s (1985)
and Hewison’s (1987, 2009) intimations of a population duped by ‘bogus’ heritage.
Here, the notion of heritage is exposed, curtailed, manipulated and then broadcast as
some sort of symbol of the ideal ‘nation’ against which excluded groups are measured.
An inability to mindfully engage with such an expression of heritage thereby becomes
synonymous with the failure of certain citizens to live up to it. To ﬂesh this argument
out more fully, I start ﬁrst and foremost with the theoretical spaces opened up by
Laurajane Smith in Uses of Heritage (2006). Here, Smith introduced a dominant heri-
tage narrative she termed the ‘authorised heritage discourse’ (henceforth AHD), which
is characterised by the privileging of expertise, and driven by a responsibility to ‘act
for’ and ‘steward’ a ‘universal’ past made up of grand, tangible and aesthetically
pleasing sites, monuments and buildings. This materiality, the discourse asserts, needs
to be ‘conserved as found’, as it is an inheritance belonging to future generations, a
sentiment that thus limits the uses of heritage in the present to education, tourism and

346

E. Waterton

rituals of nationalism (see Smith 2006, Smith and Waterton 2009, Waterton 2010).
Consequently,
the AHD constructs an idea of heritage that revolves around an
unbroken relationship between past and future, with little negotiation within that rela-
tionship allowed for an active engagement with heritage in the present. Instead, people
– as visitors, audiences and users – are assumed to take up a passive role, to which the
beneﬁts of heritage are demonstrated. Moreover, in England at least, this ‘viewing’
public has assumed the face of a particular and prioritised social group: the white,
upper-middle and upper classes, a point, interestingly, that has been echoed in recent
print media (see Monbiot 2009, Morgan 2010). This rendering of heritage, as Smith
(2006, pp. 234–235) points out, works to disenfranchise and exclude those social
groups who are patently not white and do not enjoy economic security.

Smith’s discussion of an authorising heritage discourse itself emerges from earlier,
disparaging, debates about heritage emerging in the 1980s. Leading the charge in
England were historians Patrick Wright and Robert Hewison, and their respective
publications, On Living in an Old Country (1985) and The Heritage Industry: Britain
in a Climate of Decline (1987). At the time, correlations between Thatcherism and cri-
tiques of the heritage industry were well documented, as was the remarkable rising
popularity and concern for the past (Wright 1985, Walsh 1992, Samuel 1994, Barthel
1996, Strangleman 1999, Pendlebury 2000). In this, the polemic of Wright and Hewi-
son was not so much a slighting of heritage but a reaction against the ‘political project
of Thatcherism’ (Hall 1988, p. 1), which had initiated a strange and contradictory
political strategy that seemed to revolve around concepts of ‘enterprise’ and ‘heritage’
(Hall 1988, p. 274, Corner and Harvey 1991a, 1991b). This reorientation, fuelled by
strong, interconnected agendas of consumerism, commodiﬁcation, individualism and
patriotism, was underpinned by a desire to promote international economic competi-
tiveness (Abercrombie et al. 2000, p. 436). Combined, the concepts of individualism,
internationalism and patriotism offered up a difﬁcult disjuncture for heritage. On the
one hand, attempts were made to sponsor a new sense of value within society, while
on the other – and at the same time – emphasis was placed upon tradition and continu-
ity. Radical reform and the promotion of a regenerated economy were thus pitted
against a conservative obsession with the past. Inherent within these critiques was
thus a palpable reaction to Thatcherite drives towards making history a commodity or
selling point (Samuel 1994, p. 266). These concerns underpinned almost entirely the
responses offered by Wright and Hewison, who saw the rapid replacement of ‘real’
heritage experiences by manufactured, inauthentic and trivialising leisure facilities as
a foregone conclusion of Thatcherite economics (McGuigan 1996, p. 122).

As a product of the market, heritage thus became a ‘cosy or romantic ploy’ used
to dupe the visiting proﬁle. However, as a number of recent scholars have pointed
out, to assume that heritage is little more than an exercise in idealising nostalgia over-
looks the more complex ways with which the past is engaged with in the present
(Dicks 2000, 2008, Smith 2006, Hodge 2011). Indeed, this fetishising of nostalgia
renders the ‘act’ of heritage as something tied up with the past, rather than explicitly
acknowledging the relationship heritage has with the present (Dicks 2000). A central
problematic emerging from this is that heritage ‘visitors’ are essentially precluded
from any real sense of engagement that deviates from received and/or authorised mes-
sages. The consumption practices that frame this approach verge on the ‘mindless’,
based as they are on the suggestion of inculcation and unquestioned communication
(Strangleman 1999, p. 727). This overlooks the ﬂexibility and ability – indeed, the
desire – of what the tourism literature identiﬁes as the ‘mindful’ or ‘insightful’ visitor



347

to question, test, reﬂect, accept or reject the heritage experiences they are visiting
(Moscardo 1996, Poria et al. 2004, 2006). Instead, visitors are assumed to accept,
naïvely and simplistically, the nostalgic representations and re-enactments set before
them, a notion that fails entirely to capture the more nuanced experiences of a range
of audiences.

My positive use of notions of mindfulness, while conceptually useful for advanc-
ing theoretical debates about heritage and its uses, is underpinned by a real concern
with current policy orientations towards ‘inclusion’. Although this term was initially
introduced into the language of politics via the UK’s New Labour government, it
continues to preoccupy the policies pursued by David Cameron’s Conservatives as
well. Where the term features in both the British and international heritage literature,
viewpoints tend to be polarised between claims that the heritage/inclusion dyad is
either patronising and misguided or democratising and empowering (Mason 2004,
pp. 49–50). More recently, the ground-swell of agendas surrounding ‘inclusion’ in
Britain have linked up with the term ‘cohesion’, a move triggered by a number of
highly visible political events, such as the emotionally-charged crisis over the inﬂux
of asylum-seekers, attempts to reconsider what ‘Britishness’ means, concepts of citi-
zenship and issues of racism and tolerance. In this milieu, particular discourses have
been called upon to make sense of changing social contexts and these, as Joseph and
Roberts (2004, p. 4) point out, entail ‘epistemological distortions’ that work to
favour certain social groups. Within the heritage context, those groups underrepre-
sented have, unsurprisingly, tended to consist of ethnic minorities and the working
classes. This is an important point, as it is these same groups – both of which are
categorically ‘different’ from the white middle classes – that the AHD nominates as
those requiring the proactive attention of heritage professionals to foster inclusion
(Waterton 2010). The continued need to rehearse particular past formations (those
cultural symbols of the white middle classes) may, then, be part of a wider attempt
to both mobilise and privilege the assumed legitimacy of a homogenous national
identity against recent calls for social inclusion. In short, the continued survival of a
defence of, and nostalgia for, certain notions of heritage may well be part and parcel
of a wider defensive move towards reclaiming a singular national past. Within this
conceptual space, the AHD is able to mask its ideological underpinnings and utilise
the tropes of ‘inclusion’ and ‘cohesion’ to target speciﬁc, underrepresented social
groups and actively encourage the disinheritance of those aspects and experiences of
heritage associated with them (after Caffyn and Lutz 1999, Ashworth 2002). While
this process of obfuscation is inevitably shot-through with the complex posturings of
power, Smith (2006) argues that it has not occurred without conﬂict. Here, she draws
our attention speciﬁcally to attempts by marginalised groups to construct and cele-
brate an oppositional sense of heritage at industrial history museums – where the
darker side of history is sometimes exposed. What follows, then, is an attempt to
substantiate the observations made by Smith with the addition of a different genre of
social history museum – those concerned with the creation of beauty within the grim
circumstances of pottery manufacture in the Potteries.

The Potteries’ industrial heritage: an introduction
The Staffordshire Potteries, located in the West Midlands region of England between
Manchester and Birmingham, is the affectionate name given to the urban areas
predominantly based in and around the conurbation of the ‘city’ of Stoke-on-Trent –

348

which is in reality the linear conﬁguration of six confederated towns (Tunstall, Burslem,
Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton). The name ‘the Potteries’ is, quite literally, a reﬂec-
tion of the area’s traditional industry – ceramics manufacture – which has left an indeli-
ble mark upon the social, cultural and political fabric of the city. That particular
tradition of industry had been practised in the area since the ﬁfteenth century and today,
though the industry itself has all but disappeared, it is still a city strongly associated with
prominent manufacturing companies such as Wedgwood, Minton, Spode and Royal
Doulton. This association is also spatially articulated and remembered, as the city’s
landscape is dotted with derelict bottle ovens that haunt the city with their visual intima-
tions of the past (after Edensor 2005). In addition to ceramic production, the area also
includes signiﬁcant coalmining and steel industries in its history, but it ultimately con-
centrated on the production of a single product – pottery – over any other (Jayne 2004,
p. 201). As Jayne (p. 201) points out, this emphasis plays no idle role in the continuing
disjuncture between ‘bosses’ and ‘workers’, with employment structures today still
rehearsing a similar lack of clerical or managerial intermediaries, leading to the margin-
alisation of a range of business, ﬁnancial and support industries. In other words, as Jay-
ne (p. 201) goes on to argue, the contemporary economy continues to have ‘an
identiﬁable lack of middle-class representation and the consumption spaces of the city
are dominated by working-class interests’.

During its industrial peak, the area was fuelled by a large and skilled workforce nec-
essary not only for the production of ceramics as ﬁnished products, but in the associated
mills, mines and canals responsible for the supply of raw materials. The ceramic manu-
facturing process called upon different skill-sets, revolving around the preparation of
clay, shaping and assembly, ﬁring and decorating. Collectively, these processes were
responsible for the shaping of a peculiar urban landscape and skyline, dotted with the
distinct shapes of the pot-banks, their cobbled yards and ﬁery, smoking bottle ovens.
The area’s lexicon is also littered with the strangely iconic language of the industry, with
terms such as ‘saggers’, ‘mufﬂe kilns’, ‘bottom knockers’, ‘mould runners’, ‘bungs in
the oven’, ‘slag heaps’ and ‘handle-makers’ offering a ﬂavour of this colourful termi-
nology. Although not quite post-industrial in nature, deindustrialisation has signalled
signiﬁcant loss for Stoke-on-Trent. For example, the Staffordshire coalﬁeld closures of
the 1990s, completed with the cessation of the Trentham super-pit in 1994, culminated
in a loss of some 15,000 jobs (Sekers 2009). This was compounded with the ﬁnal phase
of the folding of the Shelton Steel Works in 2002, which likewise saw a loss of 10,000
jobs in the area (Thomas and Hague 2000, Sekers 2009). The ceramic industry has also
undergone a dramatic down-turn. Employment has been reduced by 50 per cent since
the 1950s, and overseas outsourcing dominates most remaining ceramic manufacturing,
with major companies such as Spode and Minton faced with administration (Jayne
2000, p. 22). It is thus an area witness to immense transformations in its industrial, geo-
graphical, social and cultural structures, the lingering effects of which continue to shape
contemporary identity politics.

The data presented in this study emerges from material gathered at Gladstone Pot-
tery Museum, a social history museum located in Longton, which represents an inter-
mediate phase in the production process and rests on the site of a typical ‘pottery’,
complete with bottle ovens and factory workshops. Here, skilled workers would have
fashioned, ﬁred and decorated their craft, often working in intense and dangerous con-
ditions. The ﬁeldwork for this project revolved around the collection of face-to-face,
researcher-administered surveys and was timed to coordinate with the ‘peak’ tourism
season at all three museums, commencing in May 2009 and concluding in October of



349

the same year. The survey instrument was relatively simple and mirrored exactly (for
comparative purposes) that developed and used by Smith in her own research at
industrial museums. In terms of design, the survey included closed questions that cap-
tured background measures and basic demographics (such as age, gender, occupation
and so forth), as well as open-ended questions that sought to elicit responses that
would reveal something about visitor attitudes, beliefs, feelings and opinions. All sur-
veys were recorded,1 transcribed and coded, with dominant themes highlighted, quan-
tiﬁed and tallied for analytical purposes. In total, 294 visitors were surveyed. This
paper, however, is concerned primarily with material gathered at the Gladstone Pot-
tery Museum, which constituted 77 surveys. All extracts used from these surveys have
been numbered with participant codes that sit alongside the museum code, ‘GMA’.
All extracts are also accompanied by an indication of the participant’s age, gender and
self-identiﬁed main household occupation.

Description of the site

Although nestled between the noise and bustle of the A50 and the A521, both well-
trodden roads in the city of Stoke-on-Trent, the Gladstone Pottery Museum seems
remarkably quiet upon ﬁrst entering what
is essentially a very small open-air
museum. The remarkable pace of change over the entire area has rendered the
museum space, to borrow from Edensor (2008), something of a haunting; a small
trace of the past etched into a city that is struggling to regenerate. This sense of
‘haunting’ is intensiﬁed by the museum’s muted auditory recordings of potters at
work, as whispers and gasps in the background are piped into the displays, punctu-
ated with the melodious striking of tools and the hissing and rumbling of machinery
in action. Today, the open yards surrounding the site’s numerous workshops are
dusty and worn, scattered with visually perplexing objects and the intrusive texture
of remaining bottle ovens, all of which are overlaid by a musty smell and an impli-
cit if arrested sense of decay. Each lingering intrusion is a powerfully affective ves-
tige that leaks into the present, working to summon up an imaginative impression
of how this place once sounded and felt. It is here that visitors are asked to view
the darker side of ceramic production, a side often hidden at many of the other
museums in the area such as The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery and the Wedg-
wood Visitor Centre, which focus upon ‘the ﬁnished product’. Instead, the grimness
of this manufacturing industry is sensually imbued as visitors think and feel their
way around the site amid the relentless and repetitive rhythms of machinery and the
imposing closeness of the ovens.

Study sample

Tables 1 and 2 summarise the participant sample in terms of general demographics,
employment data, level of education, holiday versus local visitors, national identity and
cultural afﬁliation. Here, the sample of 77 visitors can be summarily characterised as
having a slight leaning towards female (59.7 per cent) visitors over the age of 60 (44.2
per cent). In terms of occupation, visitors represented a variety of households, with
higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations accounting for 31.2 per
cent, intermediate occupations accounting for 16.9 per cent and routine and manual
occupations accounting for 32.5 per cent of visitors. In terms of visitor trends based
upon ‘social class’, this represents a higher than anticipated number of visitors from

routine and manual occupations, which measured at 14 per cent in a recent museum exit
survey conducted for the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) in the UK.2
The remaining 19.4 per cent comprised of students, unemployed or retired visitors. In
terms of education, the sample returned a high proportion of university graduates, with
40.3 per cent of visitors nominating either under- or postgraduate degrees. Signiﬁcantly,
71.43 per cent had travelled from home, with the remaining 28.57 per cent indicating
that they were on holiday. Of the 77 people surveyed, 46.8 per cent self-identiﬁed as
local to the area, with 79.2 per cent identifying themselves as either British or English.
Interestingly, this visitor proﬁle was more segmented when asked about ‘cultural afﬁlia-
tion’, which prompted only a small number of visitors to nominate British (3.9 per cent),
with a not insigniﬁcant number specifying ‘white’ British/English (18.2 per cent).
Finally, 52 per cent of all visitors to the Gladstone Pottery Museum were not members
of any heritage organisations, with the remaining visitors nominating membership of
English Heritage (10.4 per cent) and the National Trust (39.0 per cent); 3.9 per cent did
not answer this question.

Heritaging in working class spaces
Recent writers have drawn attention to the need to question why policymakers
remain unmoved by the absence of traditional heritage visitors – the predominantly
white, middle classes – in a range of working class and ethnic minority heritage
spaces (Smith and Waterton 2009). To make this case, scholars have provided
nuanced explorations of engagements with heritage in contexts other than those
accepted as ‘heritage’ within the AHD. This work contributes to those arguments,
though it is important to note that the data presented here contains a more muted
sense of opposition than that produced by Smith in 2006. Nonetheless, while there
is certainly an undercurrent of opinion that ties in nicely with the AHD at the
Gladstone Potteries Museum, a still signiﬁcant proportion of its visitors engaged in
critical heritage work that speaks to a reanimation of heritage via processes of

352

E. Waterton

affect, embodiment, memory and identity-work. For example, while 36.36 per cent
of visitors suggested a meaning of heritage that conformed to the AHD, a consider-
able 32.47 per cent intimated that heritage was something more intangible and per-
haps better understood in conjunction with expressions of local identity. This same
number also nominated that their experiences of visiting the museum were overlaid
with attempts to engage in active memory-work (12.99 per cent) or to feel empathy
for and connection with people in the past (19.48 per cent). This provocation of
memory-work may in part be explained with reference to the number of visitors
who expressed personal afﬁnity with the history captured by the museum, with 16.9
per cent speciﬁcally nominating a strong afﬁliation with either a working class
background or a Stoke-based (‘Stokie’ or ‘Potter’) history. Signiﬁcantly, 50.66 per
cent of visitors felt that they were ‘part’ of the history they were visiting, with just
over half of these visitors emphatic in their personal connection to the history on
display. This was not, for the most part, an occasion wherein visitors saw them-
selves as outsiders looking in, seeking experiences and knowledge through the
heritage of others. Rather, it was a moment of personal reﬂection:

the history that I’m visiting here it’s deﬁnitely local history.
When I think about
Stoke-on-Trent was and still is to an extent renowned for producing pottery, but it’s
also clearly working class in the nuts and bolts of it, you know. The day-to-day living
was working class, even though management – as it is today – was probably middle
class, so because it’s working class the history represented here is bigger and wider
than just the local history; it’s history across the nation of working class people. . . . In
terms of an aspect of my personal identity that this place speaks to, because I am orig-
inally from Stoke-on-Trent of course I love it because it celebrates what Stoke-on-
Trent has been famous for. I identify with it . . . I do obsess about where plates come
from even when I’m in a restaurant at the other side of the world. I like to know if
it’s Wedgwood or not, so it is quite a personal experience for me. But it’s not all
happy-clappy niceness; it’s also being reminded of where working class grit and hard
work can get you in the sense of achievement, so yeah, thanks. (GMA043: female,
30–40, teacher)

Yeah, I think Heather got it earlier when she said we’re Stoke born and bred. I mean
we do, we have got parents and grandparents that have worked in the industry and we
feel very much rooted in this, you know. It might be an old fashioned concept but,
yeah. I mean, every time we go away, for example, wherever we are in the world, we
always look at the pottery and see whether it did originate in Stoke. (GMA056: male,
over 60, chartered surveyor)

Although clear markers of identity-work, there is something also ‘performative’ sig-
nalled in these responses, where intimations of identity become bodily expressed in
terms of what ‘the body’ does as it remembers and performs identity in other con-
texts. The simple act of gravitating to the underside of crockery, turning it over and
seeking out information on the manufacturer’s name, just to know, is telling of a
sense of pride in the skilled work associated with the locality and an identity rooted
in that place. It is, then, a sense of identity that is sought ﬁrst through mediated rep-
resentations, ﬁltered through visual creativity and then settled into a more intimate
sense of self – even when the body is ‘out of place’ and not physically present in
the geographical spaces of the Potteries. In addition to these ‘not-in-place’ afﬁrma-
tions of identity, there was also something potently powerful about the visit itself,
in the capacity of the museum to affect memory:



353

Well, I can relate to my grandfather, actually, who worked in a foundry and all my
ancestors were working people, brass casters and iron casters and so on, so I can
relate to all this really. . . . Yeah, almost everything in mine [history] actually, I think,
yeah. Not my father, my father was a publican and a railwayman so I don’t think he
ever worked in this sort of environment but everyone else I can think of in my for-
bearers did, so yeah most of it actually. . . . I used to take my grandfather’s lunch
down to the foundry he worked in when I was a small kid you know, and went into
the foundry so yeah, I can see all that. And we lived in back-to-back houses in Bir-
mingham, so yeah, I feel very comfortable in here actually! [laughs] Yeah, I do.
(GMA048: male, over 60, retired)

Yes, some of the things, some of the machinery, brings back memories of when I was
little, just after the war, they were still being used. So yeah, the whole um . . . it’s an
ongoing thing, really, isn’t it? (GMA049: female, over 60, retired)

identity and memory – with their past. Indeed,

For these visitors, being-in-place was central for their establishment of a connection
– through feeling,
in all four
extracts, emotion and identity can be seen as mobile, embedded in notions of heri-
tage as ‘embodied practice’ and ‘experience’. This makes better sense when thought
of with reference to work by David Crouch (2001, 2002, 2003a, 2003b, 2010; see
also Selby 2010), as well as wider sociological debates that can broadly be deﬁned
as ‘non-representational’ theory (Thrift 2004, 2008). Using Crouch and Thrift,
notions of embodied or bodily practice can be used to offer valuable insight into
the range of ways heritage might be encountered and employed. The visitors quoted
above, for instance, were visibly energised – with joy, rootedness or a sense of
comfort – by their reawakened memories and attunement with the museum. This
ability of the body to be affected draws attention to ideas of performativity and
bodily practices, particularly those that take place within mundane, banal and every-
day practices, which ‘shape the conduct of human beings towards others and them-
selves in particular sites’ (Thrift 1997, pp. 126–127). With this emphasis on ‘bodily
thinking’, rather than ‘simply thinking’, notions of embodiment draw attention to
the ways in which heritage users move and bodily engage with surrounding places,
people and things (Crouch and Grassick 2005, p. 49):

GMA069: I think it makes you realise how not that long ago, so what are we talking
about? 100 years, Victorian times, how poor a lot of people were and how the living
conditions were very, very poor and we forget that very quickly now. I think that this
country is very critical of other countries, you know, child labour and what have you,
forgetting that it was only 100 years ago that we had it! Children living in very, very
poor conditions, infant mortality – dreadful rates, life expectancy – dreadful. It was
only 100 years ago – here.

GMA068: I was going to say, the thing that struck me is the life expectancy and child
mortality . . . um . . . which have so vastly improved.

GMA070: I think it’s very easy to read about history and it just go in one ear and out
the other. I think when you come and see it, practically, in a situation like this, I think
it comes home to you more and moves you.

GMA068: Yes, it helps to bring it home, and also to remember it as well, when
you’ve been to a place like this. It’s not something that you read, think and then forget
about tomorrow.

GMA069: Yeah, it appeals to more senses than just your reading, it’s. . .

GMA068: Yes, it’s like a visual aid really. . .

GMA070: It’s more than tangible, more hands on, in your mind, to retain it more and
for longer I think and more colourfully.

GMA068: I mean when you look at the machinery and the buildings that were in use
as recently as 1960, you know, it’s very, very close past.

GMA070: And I mean we’re not far from that era so we think our parents would have
been there as adults and as children . . . um . . . like our mothers working in the mills
and the grandmothers listening to that constant noise and understanding more the
effect it had on them really.

GMA068: I moved to Crewe in 1958 and I can remember seeing the potteries for the
ﬁrst time and it was exactly as you see in those pictures . . . hundreds of bottle ovens
and smoke, this is 1958, ’59, ’60 and then, of course, it disappeared and you almost
forget. And now, seeing this, you think, yeah it did actually look like that when I ﬁrst
saw the potteries, 40, 50 years ago.

GMA070: And then, of course, it was just razed to the ground.

GMA068: And it’s just disappeared and almost got forgotten about and this brings it
back to the memory and brings it back to life. (GMA068: male, over 60 retired;
GMA69: female, over 60, teacher; GMA070: female, over 60, teacher)

This exchange, while on the one hand an explicit attempt to work through, verbally,
the site of memory before them, also demonstrates a corporeal expression – in bod-
ily feelings and sensual engagements – through which these visitors animated the
heritage space in which they found themselves. This visceral shift works to intro-
duce a much-needed sense of agency, affectivity and subjectivity into heritage theo-
rising, and offers a more nuanced understanding of the consequences, implications
and outcomes of doing heritage. Understanding and placing the body at the centre
of this conceptualisation, as sensuous, expressive, agentive and always in process,
demonstrates that the bodily practices of everyday life cannot simply be turned off,
but instead continue to respond to, and negotiate, feelings of identity. In these sites,
especially, it is the body that lies at the centre of memories about the nature of
manual work and how visitors perceive, embody and attempt to identify with such
labour through museum displays.

While the museum may not have represented the speciﬁcs of a particular family
history (though this was the case for 14.29 per cent of visitors) for all museum-
goers, the recognisability and familiarity of the museum’s narrative as ‘local/regio-
nal’ (29.87 per cent), ‘industrial’ (18.2 per cent) or ‘working class’ (10.39 per cent)
meant that the museum was still able to satiate feelings of belonging. Perhaps this
is the reason why so many visitors – although given an exhaustive selection of cate-
the site – overwhelmingly
gories for
responded that they had come for the ‘experience of seeing how working people
lived in the past’ (39.0 per cent). Coupled with the dominant response to the ques-
tion ‘How does it make you feel’, which saw affective words like ‘humbled’ (33.77
per cent), ‘proud’ (9.09 per cent) and ‘nostalgic’ (9.09 per cent) emerge, this sug-

‘reasons for visiting’

interpreting their



355

gests, as Smith (2006, p. 216) herself notes, that something active was occurring
during these moments of visitation:

I think it makes me feel . . . feel proud, proud to be a Stokey, because it is just . . . it’s
just so important. . . . So I feel proud that we’ve still got this one [indicates museum],
you know, one place that we can come to and you can feel close to . . . close to your
family, really . . . it just, it just feels like coming home, doesn’t it? (GMA009: female,
18–29, teaching assistant)

It’s great to see it, you know, to be reminded. And it’s empowering as you realise you
can, you can do these things, really, or are capable of. . . (GMA018: female, 30–40,
unknown)

When I visit here I feel quite . . . I feel quite proud of what Stoke-on-Trent achieved
and of pride also in working class people just, you know, making things go along year
after year, producing skilled, high quality stuff. (GMA043: female, 30–40, teacher)

Well yeah, nostalgia. . . . Grateful to be alive when we’re alive today and as working
class folk we would’ve worked in a place like this, you know, and it would’ve been
very, very hard. I wouldn’t be alive today, I’d be dead, yeah, ’cause it would’ve killed
like it killed me grandfather, yeah? (GMA036: male, 40–59, occupational
me,
therapist)

So, I think for me, it’s like a feeling that all my . . . the people that – except my cou-
sin Jean who was a ﬁgure painter – but all my family who have all died and they all
worked in the pots, didn’t they, it’s like . . . yeah, it’s a bit of nostalgia ain’t it? Just a
feeling of . . . well I’m glad I’ve come. . . . This is just a bit more personal because it
touches on your life that you led as a child and you can remember. I can remember
standing on the step when my Granny used to look after me and waving at my Mum
– not my Mum, yeah, my Mum – and my Auntie off down the street with their tur-
bans in their hair, going to work, you know, ’cos the factories were only just down
the road from where they lived ’cos they were all in the same area. (GMA076: female,
40–59, electrician)

Somewhere within the process of walking through and talking about the site,
taking stock of surroundings, thinking about one’s place in history and coming to
know a site of heritage through an individual or series of expressive encounters,
heritage became not so much a material ‘thing’ or ‘set piece’, as is constructed by
the AHD, but a cultural process and experience that evoked a multi-sensual and
multi-imaginative reaction (Smith 2006). Rather than simply being observed, this
it was reﬁgured and
sense of heritage was encountered, and in each moment
reworked, subtly adjusting the lives of those involved in the process. No longer an
objectiﬁed ‘thing’,
the heritage represented in the museum was continually
produced, re-produced and re-imagined, attaining a ﬂuidity seldom recognised in a
policy sense. It became an experience – certainly an active and self-reﬂexive
one – that was done and felt, many facets of which emerge out of the haunting,
atmospheric and mediatised spaces of memory produced by the museum:

Here, you can hear the history, you can almost hear them walking about and what . . .
you can almost feel them here, and you take that away and you’ve got nothing. . .
(GMA009: female, 18–29, teaching assistant)

How does it make you feel to visit this place?

GMA032: Proud, proud.

GMA031: I’m very proud. I was watching that introductory ﬁlm and I, I really wanted
to cry at one point. . .

Because it was so touching?

GMA031: It is; it is. And you think, you know, in one way you’re glad that, you
know, the chimneys and the smoke and the awful atmosphere it must’ve had in those
it’s so sad now, what’s happened to the Potteries, so sad. . .
days has gone, but
(GMA031 and GMA032: females, over 60, retired)

These types of response remind us that heritage engagements can also be intensely
emotional, reﬂecting an observation made by Poria et al. (2003, 2004), who assert
that heritage is about a want, need or desire to be exposed to, and involved in, per-
sonal experiences. This brings forward an important dimension often overlooked by
conventional attempts to render heritage users passive receptors in need of ‘educa-
tion’ and/or ‘entertainment’. Indeed, as Poria et al. (2004, p. 21) point out, ‘there
[is] something else going on that has yet to be discovered’. In this context, a differ-
ent heritage-user emerged from the ‘mindless dupe’ conjured by Wright and Hewi-
son, one that was diverse and complicated, punctuated with emotions and
imagination, and, importantly, entirely present within the heritage process, as the
following exchange makes clear:

To whom is the history of the people who worked in this industry important?

GMA076: Future generations.

GMA075: To my kids and my grandchildren and me.

GMA076: Yeah, to be reminded of it all.

GMA075: Yeah, ’cos you soon forget . . . we forget.

So you come back to remember?

GMA075: Yeah.

GMA076: Yeah, it’s been a good reminder. You can remember feelings as well can’t
you. You remember. . .

Ah, so as you’re walking around its sort of. . .

GMA076: Yeah, oh I can remember that and oh I can . . .and like. . .

GMA075: Our Jean used to do that, Uncle Dennis used to do that. . .



357

GMA076: Yeah, different . . . and as we’ve been going round and talking to the differ-
ent people who’ve been, like, making the ﬂowers or whatever, they’ve been coming
out with these different terms – fettling and lithographing and all that sort of thing –
and, oh is that what? I’d heard the name and knew that someone in my family did that
job but I didn’t know what that job was.

GMA075: We didn’t know exactly what they did.

GMA076: You know, I didn’t know what a mould-maker was – well you could have
a good idea of what a mould-maker was – or a mould-runner, I didn’t know what a
mould-runner was . . . um . . . lithographer, gilder, another one – I didn’t know that
was the painting around the edge of the . . . and the polisher, that’s another one. So all
these terms have all meant something.

GMA075: You know a pot man paints pots but you don’t know as they’ve got paint
mixers. . .

Yeah, it makes all the difference.

GMA076: Well, I don’t suppose it did in our day, when I was a girl because it was all
done somewhere else, I suppose, but I know what you mean, years ago, when people
were mixing paints, yeah, I don’t know. Would they have done it?

GMA075: I’d have thought so, I bet Doulton’s have got them, when they were a mod-
ern factory, I bet they were always looking for new and better ways. . .

GMA076: Yeah, maybe.

GMA075: Of poisoning the workforce! [laughs] (GMA075: male, 40–59, electrician;
GMA076: female, 40–59, electrician)

This distinctly personal and intimate ﬂavour of engagement was also raised by other
visitors, who more explicitly drew attention to the intensity of recognising and own-
ing this heritage:

We’ll we’d miss it, really. We’d really miss it if it wasn’t here. Because it’s our heri-
tage, isn’t it? (GMA003: female, over 60, power-station worker)

It feels almost a part, a part of us, it’s like if this was, if this was ever knocked down
or people were trying to destroy it I would have very strong viewings about it because
we feel it belongs to us. You . . . our ancestors made this place what it is so, you
know, it belongs to us really, we’ve all got a share in it if you like.(GMA009: female,
18–29, teaching assistant)

It should, you know what I mean . . . I think now there can’t be many parts of the
country where the collapse of an industry hasn’t touched the local community. You
could argue you could leave here perhaps with a tinge of sadness, you know,
mourning for something that can’t or will never be resurrected, not
in this form
anyway. (GMA004: male, 40–59, IT director)

The affective responses relayed here are not conﬁned to the extreme, but may occur
on any occasion on which an individual does heritage. Each time we attempt to make
sense of the memories, emotions or impulses evoked through acts or places of heri-

358

E. Waterton

tage, we enter the parameters of affect. To this end, it remains an intensely personal
experience, regardless of its broader links to a range of sub-national and national iden-
tities. It compounds and integrates the realities of ‘being’ and ‘doing’, of understand-
ing, imagining, thinking and feeling, such that we are textured and punctuated by
‘being in place’ with heritage. Although undoubtedly a prompt for triggering memo-
ries, utterances such as those above also re-characterise heritage as something that is
reﬂexively constructed in, and about, the present (Crang 1996, p. 24). Indeed, as Gra-
ham (2002, p. 1004) points out, ‘we create the heritage we require and manage it for a
range of purposes deﬁned by the needs and demands of our present societies’. For
some heritage users, this may not be the critical engagement often recited in recent lit-
erature, and I hasten to add that this is no bad thing, but a more relaxed, leisured expe-
rience. For others, a more meaningful and critical self-awareness will occur. Either
way, the moment of ‘heritage’ falls squarely in the present, within people, at that point
when someone realises (or not) that they have been affected. Perhaps this effect, as
McIntosh and Prentice (1999, p. 598) point out, will emerge from ‘insights into some-
thing new, having enjoyed reliving memories . . . or having had fun’, or as Smith
(2006, pp. 304, 303) discovered, ‘mark[ing] out those commonplace areas of life wor-
thy of celebration’, or ‘passing on . . . feelings of comradeship, gratitude, injustice,
kinship and belonging’. Whether the effect is pedagogic, hedonic or something else,
the heritage user is responding in a way that extends beyond the cognitive, as a crucial
part of the production and consumption of heritage occurs ‘in place’, actively (McIn-
tosh and Prentice 1999, p. 607). Thus, the idea of embodiment introduced earlier
becomes more straightforward – it happens all the time, after all. Indeed, much of
what we do and know is rooted in our bodily reactions and activities (Johnson 1999,
p. 81). It is, as Casey (1996, p. 21) suggests, how we come to translate space into
place – it occurs through our own bodies. Likewise, Bourdieu (1990, p. 73, emphasis
in original), makes the point that the:

body believes in what it plays at: it weeps if it mimes grief. It does not represent what
it performs, it does not memorize the past, it enacts the past, bringing it back to life.
What is ‘learned by body’ is not something that one has, like knowledge that can be
brandished, but something that one is.

Nonetheless, the ways in which bodies remember and perform in our daily lives is a
difﬁcult concept to attend to empirically. Capturing memory as embodied means
watching for those moments in which meaning is rekindled, often unexpectedly, and
usually in response to a confrontation with sights, sounds, smells. Visitors to the Glad-
stone Pottery Museum were asked to attempt to reﬂect upon their awareness in rela-
tion to themselves   what they felt, how they moved and how they responded   but
these reactions were not always easy, or possible, to articulate. This was an issue I
understood well, and triggered self-reﬂections upon my own experiences at Ausch-
witz (Auschwitz (I) and Auschwitz-Birkenau (II)) a few years previously, which had
forced me to experience a multi-sensual and affective encounter I had not (indeed,
could not have) imagined before being there. The way I felt, how I moved and the
responses I acted upon were as much a part of the experience as my knowledge of its
atrocities, harboured as they were within the brutal physicality of its buildings. It was
a complicated and tense encounter, one that I came to understand better (though never
totally) through these embodied experiences and, signiﬁcantly, through my own terms
and reactions. Importantly, I have since remained energised by what I witnessed at



359

that time, which makes the point that we need to take greater account of the capacity
particular places or narratives have to evoke emotions and, moreover, frame and cir-
cumscribe visitor experiences.

As Olick and Robbins (1998, p. 126; see also Sutton 2000, p. 208) point out,
memory is one of the planes upon which negotiations regarding different narratives of
the past compete for dominance. This idea emerges from Foucault’s (1977) conceptu-
alisation of ‘counter-memory’, or those memories that contest or react against domi-
nant discourses (Olick and Robbins 1998, p. 126). Sturken (1997, p. 9), too, argues
for the centrality of memory, maintaining that it is memories that reveal ‘the stake
held by individuals and institutions in attributing meaning to the past’. Many of the
people in this study used their visit to hold up the past, remember it and take issue
with the incoherences that were revealed:

GMA030: I think, I think personally how lucky we are today and how easy we have
it in all fairness.

GMA029: I just don’t think you appreciate the sorts of sacriﬁces people went through
really, and it was just a common part of their life, like ﬁve year olds working in the
pits . . . it makes you think about our own little son. (GMA030: male, 41–60, educa-
tion advisor; GMA029: female, 30–40, education advisor)

The messages are about hard work, working-class people and if I was going to be
controversial I would say how I think that’s still true today, although it’s different in
terms of maybe more service industry than a hard kind of physical labour that we read
about here at Gladstone, but I still think you know, the message is working class have
for years, and still do, drive a country’s economy, massively, and it’s often under-
stated. (GMA043: female, 30–40, teacher)

Kansteiner (2002), in his review of the conceptual underpinnings of collective
memory, constructs an understanding of memory that draws upon three elements: ﬁrst,
he proposes that there is a range of different representations of the past; second, there
are ‘memory makers’ who select and sustain particular examples of such traditions;
and third, there are ‘memory consumers’ who use, dismiss or transform those repre-
sentations in line with their own wants and desires (p. 180). Sometimes those uses
will be afﬁrmative, but in other instances they will be oppositional, and here at the
Gladstone Pottery Museum a seam of dissonance and tension over the deﬁnition of
heritage was raised:

Yeah, because obviously being a member of the National Trust you visit very luxuri-
ous places and you think, my, how lovely it would’ve been to live here. And then you
come to places like this and you see how hard people worked, how hard people
fought for their rights, just for a fair wage, really, so I think, I think this place is a
real monument to . . . [interjection by GMA010: The working class] . . . Yeah, the
working-class, I really do. (GMA009: female, 18–29, teaching assistant; GMA010:
female, 18–29, teaching assistant)

And these aren’t just, you know, some middle class art-school-trained people, these were
ordinary working-class people who were trained, admittedly, in their craft, but produced
beautiful things yeah, and it should be treasured and these people, the ordinary people
who came to work every day at half seven and worked all day long on whichever pottery
company it happened to be, these are the, I mean we often hear the names, Wedgwood,

360

E. Waterton

and we learn about the Wedgwood family and we learn about, you know, but what about
the ordinary people? (GMA031: female, over 60, retired)

I think it just reminds me that there were a lot of very rich people who beneﬁtted from
an awful lot of very poor people. . . (GMA011: female, under 18, translator)

Heritage doesn’t have to be rich people, Kings and Queens, that is not just heritage. . .
(GMA009: female, 18–29, teaching assistant)

I’m sick of hearing about Lord Lar-di-da or Lady this or that. The country focuses too
much on country houses and all that and forgets that it was built on the blood of the
working class. I think it’s time we raised the proﬁle of this history – it’s horrible and
dark and grimy but it happened. (GMA059: female, over 60, retired)

Remembering, recollecting and forgetting, in this way, all become part of the process
of doing heritage – and critical self-reﬂection, by the same token, becomes a part of
the process by which memory is enacted upon and put to use (Suleiman 2006, p. 8).
Similar queries and ﬂashings of emotion were captured by Smith (2006) at the social
history museums dedicated to the mining past, in which rejections of the authorised
heritage discourse were also palpable, but these explicit references were, on the
whole, in the minority at Gladstone. More muted though they certainly are than the
results discussed by Smith, these reﬂections still have important things to tell us about
the nature and uses of heritage, and it is important to remember that the industry in
question here is not the same as the mining industry. While both have rapidly
declined, the pottery industry is not shackled with the same history of politics or vio-
lence resulting, of course, from the prolonged miners’ strike of 1984–1985.

Conclusion
This research has attempted to challenge the presumed absence of engaged heritage
work in de-industrialised areas, as so often espoused in the heritage literature and
related public policies. To the contrary, this study has produced data that explores the
way working class heritage becomes a device, imbued with meaning, used to trigger
and guide a self-conscious dialogue between personal and collective memories. Heri-
tage, based on this, is conceptualised in a way that conﬁrms what Smith has argued:
that heritage is more centrally about the creation of meaning, whether as a means to
check or reinforce already held ideas, learn entirely new meanings or take away a sub-
tly adapted meaning that has been re-worked or re-done in an active, cultural engage-
ment. With this in mind, heritage becomes all the more ﬁrmly rooted in ideas of
intangibility, rather than materiality as the AHD asserts. Certainly, objects, places,
landscapes, monuments, buildings and so forth are implicated in many instances of
heritaging – as mnemonic props – but these are not present on all occasions. Instead,
heritage should be thought of as sensually-charged, with memory and remembering
triggered by an array of sights, sounds, smells and emotions.

While the visitors represented here were not, on the whole, the museum-goers
anticipated by social inclusion policy, this should not be read as an attempt to reify an
idealised old working class culture. It should be read, rather, as a defence against ill-
informed policymakers who seek to say that one person’s heritage is more important
than another’s based upon lines of ethnicity or class, which is a political decision that
risks seeing elements of working class heritage consigned to history. One way around



361

this is to step away from authorising narratives that inscribe certain tangible symbols
as ‘heritage’ and re-imagine it along the lines initially suggested by Smith: as a cul-
tural process of memory- and identity-work. Thus imagined, scholars with an interest
in heritage can break away from outmoded, institutionalised deﬁnitions of heritage
and engage with it in a more unruly sense, focusing instead upon the messy and often
incomplete ways in which people try to remember things that link them (or not) to the
past, remember those things they might know about it and commit to memory those
things they have learnt or had forgotten. Embracing this idea of heritage also means
self-consciously checking our own empathetic, sensual and emotional responses to
heritage and the processes we go through as we try to remember how we felt, what
we saw, smelt, touched, and how we re-remember those activities and experiences in
our re-telling of the event. It is in this way that we can start to take a fuller account of
the senses and emotions that are triggered, played with and are a product of heritage,
acting as a conduit between past and present, implicitly encouraging different mean-
ings and experiences to be re-worked and re-considered. Importantly, it will also allow
us to grasp the ways in which they slide into, around and out of our being, through
our capacity to be affected, through the values and meanings we explore, accept and
decline, and through our decisions about what to remember and forget.
