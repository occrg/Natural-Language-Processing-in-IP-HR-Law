Intellectual property and national security
Marta Iljadica and Paul F. Scott*

1. Introduction

In the UK, the security services (by which we mean
the Security Service (MI5), the Secret Intelligence
Service (MI6) and the Government Communication
Headquarters (GCHQ)) enjoy statutory powers of
property interference to be made use of in pursuing
the functions identiÔ¨Åed for them by statute.1 A recent
judgment of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT,
ie the body charged with adjudicating upon, amongst
other things, human rights claims against the security
services)2 relating to the use of those powers for
‚Äòcomputer network exploitation‚Äô (hacking) provides
important insight into the place of intellectual prop-
erty (IP) within the matrix of these national security
powers.

The present article takes its lead from the decision of
the IPT in that case, Privacy International v Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the
Government Communications Headquarters,3 focusing
on those observations within it relating speciÔ¨Åcally to
IP.

The Ô¨Årst part of the article extrapolates from what is
said (and left unsaid) in that judgment in order to dis-
cuss the ways in which IP rights might be lawfully
overridden or limited in pursuit of national security ob-
jectives. The second part considers other ways in which
the ordinary operation of the regime of IP rights may
be modiÔ¨Åed in view of the exigencies of national secu-
rity. Given the extent to which threats to national secu-
rity, and state responses to it,
take place upon a
technical plane, these questions are of great‚Äîand grow-
ing‚ÄîsigniÔ¨Åcance.

Consideration of them here suggests that the land-
scape of IP law incorporates the exigencies of national
security to a far greater extent than has hitherto been
appreciated, but that the conÔ¨Årmation by the IPT of the
possibility of using the Intelligence Services Act 1994
(ISA 1994) to authorize the infringement of IP rights is
likely to ensure (if it was not already the case) that the

the
Investigatory Powers Tribunal
in Privacy
International v Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth
the Government
Communications Headquarters, in which the Tribunal
held that a warrant under the Intelligence Services
Act 1994 may authorize interference with copyright.
 The article addresses certain issues raised by the IPT‚Äôs
judgment, including whether intellectual property is
property for the purposes of the 1994 Act, as well as
the relevance of section 50, Copyright Designs and
Patents Act 1988, and the InfoSoc Directive in legiti-
mating interferences with copyright. It also addresses
other possible avenues‚ÄîspeciÔ¨Åcally, the public inter-
est defence‚Äîthrough which interference with copy-
right on national security grounds might be rendered
lawful.

 In holding that interference with copyright was autho-
rized by a section 5 warrant, the IPT judgment impli-
edly extends also to interference with other forms of
intellectual property, such as patents and designs. In
relation to such things, however, there exist speciÔ¨Åc
and deÔ¨Åned rules permitting the use of intellectual
property for certain purposes, including those of na-
tional security. The article therefore considers, with re-
spect to patents and designs, Crown use provisions,
subsistence rules relating to public policy and morality
and rules regarding the examination and secrecy of ap-
plications. It argues that national security interests can
be addressed within the existing intellectual property
law framework but that it is section 5 warrants that
present a broader and, for the security services, more
useful avenue for interfering with intellectual property.

1994 Act is the favoured mechanism of those called
upon to protect the UK‚Äôs national security.

2. Interference with IP under ISA 1994

The IPT judgment considers copyright in the context of
hacking and the statutory power of property interfer-
ence. In this part we address the IPT‚Äôs assessment of the
applicability of section 5 ISA 1994 warrants to IP. The
operation of section 50 Copyright Designs and Patents
Act 1988 (CDPA) and the relevance of the InfoSoc
Directive and licensing agreements,4 both of which are
brieÔ¨Çy mentioned by the IPT are discussed in subse-
quent sections in this article. Although it was not ad-
dressed by the IPT, we also consider the possibility of a
distinct public interest defence to claims of copyright
infringement where the underlying act is carried out in
pursuit of national security interests.

a. Copyright in the IPT‚Äôs judgment

The Secretary of State is empowered, by section 5 ISA
1994, to issue warrants which authorize ‚Äòthe taking . . .
of such action as is speciÔ¨Åed in the warrant in respect
of any property so speciÔ¨Åed‚Äô. The conditions under
which this power may be exercised include that the
Secretary of State thinks it ‚Äònecessary for the action to
be taken for the purpose of assisting‚Äô the security ser-
vices to carry out the functions assigned to them by
statute‚Äîeither ISA 1994 in the case of MI6 and GCHQ,
or the Security Service Act 1989 in the case of MI5. The
functions of MI5 include ‚Äòthe protection of national se-
curity and, in particular, its protection against threats
from espionage, terrorism and sabotage, from the activ-
ities of agents of foreign powers and from actions in-
tended to overthrow or undermine parliamentary
democracy by political, industrial or violent means‚Äô5
and the safeguarding of ‚Äòthe economic well-being of the
United Kingdom against threats posed by the actions or
intentions of persons outside the British Islands‚Äô.6
Those of MI6 and GCHQ are more generic and more
specialized respectively, but in each case may be exer-
cised only in the interests of national security ‚Äòwith par-
ticular reference to the defence and foreign policies of
Her Majesty‚Äôs Government in the United Kingdom‚Äô, in

the interests of the UK‚Äôs economic well-being and in
support of the prevention and detection of serious
crime.7 Further, the action taken must be proportionate
to what it seeks to achieve,8 and suitable arrangements
must (as demanded by the relevant statutes) be in place
to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information
obtained via use of these powers.9 Section 5 ISA 1994
provides explicitly that ‚Äò[n]o entry on or interference
with property or with wireless telegraphy shall be un-
lawful if it is authorised by a warrant issued by the
Secretary of State under this section.‚Äô10

The speciÔ¨Åc issue of interference with IP arose in
Privacy International in the context of a challenge to the
use of these powers of property interference to carry
out
‚Äòcomputer network exploitation‚Äô (CNE)‚Äîmore
usually described simply as (computer) hacking‚Äî
brought by lobby group Privacy International and a
number of small internet service providers. One issue
on which the IPT was required to rule was the question
of whether or not the statutory authority permitted in-
terferences with ‚Äòintangible legal rights‚Äô,11 exempliÔ¨Åed
here by‚Äîbut undoubtedly not limited to‚Äîcopyright.
In line with the argument of the claimants, one might
distinguish between ‚Äòpure‚Äô interferences with IP and
those which are a necessary consequence of a primary
interference with physical property. The distinction is
that the latter can be presumed to be implicitly autho-
rized by a section 5 warrant, even if the reference to
‚Äòproperty‚Äô in section 5 is taken to apply only to real
property. ‚ÄòPure‚Äô IP interference can be authorized, how-
ever, only if ‚Äòproperty‚Äô in the ISA 1994 is understood to
include IP. Examples of the sort of ‚Äòpure‚Äô property in-
terference at issue given in a leaked GCHQ request for
the renewal of an ISA warrant include ‚Äòmodifying com-
mercially available software to enable interception, de-
cryption and other related tasks‚Äô,12 as well as the reverse
engineering of software products where these things are
done not as a preparatory step towards a speciÔ¨Åc act of
property interference but are carried out instead ‚Äòas
part of GCHQ‚Äôs continuing efforts to maintain its tech-
nical knowledge base and develop future exploitation
opportunities‚Äô.13 These acts, the renewal request sug-
gests, ‚Äòmay represent an infringement of copyright‚Äô and
it is for that reason that the question arises.14

That copyright is ‚Äòproperty‚Äô is made clear in section
1(1) CDPA: copyright is ‚Äòa property right‚Äô subsisting in,
amongst other things, literary works,15 which are fur-
ther deÔ¨Åned to include computer programs.16 In the re-
quest for the renewal of a warrant permitting such
activities, it was observed that when the warrant in
question had originally been issued, ‚Äòthere was believed
to be no precedent for the use of a warrant under sec-
tion 5 of ISA 1994 in relation to intellectual property as
embodied in copyright or licensing agreements.‚Äô17 The
request stated, however, that the Intelligence Services
Commissioner had been consulted (in 2005) and been
‚Äòcontent‚Äô18 that section 5 could be used to remove lia-
bility which might otherwise arise out of such activity.
Similarly, a more recent report of
the Intelligence
Services Commissioner states clearly, but does not elab-
orate, that with respect to section 5 ISA and warrants
issued under it ‚Äò[p]roperty includes physical property
and intellectual property‚Äô.19 Before the IPT, the primary
argument advanced in favour of the proposition that
this was incorrect‚Äîthat ‚Äòproperty‚Äô in the 1994 Act does
not, properly understood,
include IP‚Äîwas that the
provision permitting interference with property differs
in its effect as regards ‚Äòproperty in the British Islands‚Äô,20
indicating (it was argued) that IP could not be included
within the property interferences with which were fore-
seen by the provision. The IPT made short work of this
submission, noting (most relevantly for present pur-
poses) ‚Äòthat as deÔ¨Åned by statute copyright is a collec-
tion of rights in respect of the United Kingdom‚Äô.21 Even
accepting the correctness of this conclusion, this would
seem to leave certain of the issues arising out of this
question of location unaddressed. Because certain inter-
ferences are, under the statutory framework, disallowed
if the property being interfered with is ‚Äòin the British
Islands‚Äô,22 it becomes necessary to understand where IP
is located, and whether or not an act done to physical
property abroad might constitute an interference with
an intangible property right which is ‚Äòlocated‚Äô in the
United Kingdom (and, in turn, what that means for the

legality of the underlying interference with physical
property). This difÔ¨Åculty is less likely to arise in relation
to ‚Äòpure‚Äô IP rights. That is, where the security services
are reverse engineering software,23 it is likely that the IP
rights interfered with are ‚Äòin the British Islands‚Äô in all
relevant senses and so the statutory distinction between
interferences within and outside of the British Islands
does not become relevant. Nevertheless, the conclusion
that copyright (and also, presumably, other IP rights in-
terference with which might be authorized) arises in the
UK implies that certain of the powers existing under
the ISA 1994 (which do not extend to the British
Islands) are not available in relation to it. The IPT‚Äôs
treatment of the matter is from this point of view un-
fortunately brief, focused only upon resolving the mini-
mum of the legal dispute before it.

The question of the scope of ‚Äòproperty‚Äô leads directly
to the concept of interference, and the concept of what
differentiates such a thing from, say, a mere use, or
other interaction. Much of the difÔ¨Åculty in addressing
this point with any speciÔ¨Åcity arises from the fact that it
is not clear in the judgment of the IPT what exactly is
the nature of the relevant actions carried out by the se-
curity services which (actually or potentially) constitute
an interference with intangible rights. In the realm of
physical property, with which the common law‚Äôs com-
mitment to the rule of law in the form of a requirement
of legality is normally concerned in the Ô¨Årst place, the
question is usually answered via concepts of tort‚Äîusu-
ally that of trespass, but presumably also statutory torts
including that of wrongful interference with goods.24
This reÔ¨Çects the idea‚Äîto which the key case in this area
attests‚Äîthat where there is no wrong involved, what
we are dealing with is not an interference. And only if
there is such an interference‚Äîthe common law consti-
tution says‚Äîis authority required for the act, whether
the act is perpetrated by a public or a private actor.25 In
the realm of IP, the concept of interference can be as-
similated with that of an infringement. That is, an in-
terference with IP for which authority is required

ISA 1994, s 5(3) and s 5(3A). The distinction is this: such property can
be interfered with by MI6 and GCHQ for reasons of national security
and the protection of the UK‚Äôs economic well-being, but not for pur-
poses of preventing and detecting serious crime; MI5, alternatively, may
interfere with property in the UK for such reasons, though under a par-
ticular deÔ¨Ånition of serious crime.

23 The decompilation exception in s 50B CDPA would not seem to apply
here nor can the security services‚Äô interference fall within the ambit of
observation, study or testing of a computer program in s 50BA CDPA.
The issues raised by the reverse engineering of computer programs are
made more complex insofar as such acts may reveal conÔ¨Ådential infor-
mation which presents another (potential) property interference. See T.

would seem to occur only insofar as the act in question
was copyright infringement (for example, the reproduc-
tion of a copyright work).26 Merely accessing a com-
puter program does not infringe any of the author‚Äôs
economic rights and so such access is not wrongful‚Äîin
other words, it would not constitute an interference
with a property right‚Äîand so no authority would be
required for the state to do so. Thus, while all copyright
infringements will (where there is not some superven-
ing defence) be an interference for which authority is
required,27 there remain a vast range of ‚Äòuses‚Äô of such
work which do not constitute interferences and for
which neither the 1994 Act nor other authority need be
prayed in aid. Nevertheless, a given act might constitute
an interference notwithstanding that from many points
of view the intangible right interfered with remains in-
tact. As such, that the copyright owner‚Äôs rights as
against third parties survive any interference with copy-
right by the security services is not relevant to the act‚Äôs
wrongful status, nor the requirement of authority which
follows from it. The essential point is that a given act is
to be an interference with copyright which must be au-
thorized by some legal rule (in this case, section 5 ISA
1994) would require demonstrating that the copyright
owner‚Äôs exclusive economic rights28 have been infringed
by the particular act at issue,29 such that the act was an
interference with a property right.

A further question is whether, if the access of a com-
puter program requires the circumvention of a ‚Äòtechnical
device‚Äô,30 such act will be an interference with property
which must be (and, indeed, can be) authorized by a
warrant under section 5 ISA 1994. One relevant provi-
sion of the CDPA seeks to prevent the sale of ‚Äòmeans‚Äô
which have as their ‚Äòsole intended purpose‚Äô the removal
or circumvention of such devices (or the publication of
information intended to enable such removal or circum-
vention) where the seller or publisher knows or has rea-
son to believe that the ‚Äòmeans‚Äô or the information ‚Äòwill
be used to make infringing copies‚Äô.31 Neither of these

agencies

in circumventing

acts would seem likely to be amongst practices of the se-
curity or other services in the course of investigations for
national security purposes: the most likely related possi-
bility is the sharing of information that is designed to as-
sist partner
technical
measures, but this would not seem to count as publica-
tion.32 With respect to works other than computer pro-
grams, the protection offered is more expansive with
section 296ZA providing that where a person know-
ingly33 circumvents a ‚Äòtechnological measure‚Äô the copy-
right owner or the exclusive licensee will ‚Äòhave the same
rights against [the person circumventing] as a copyright
owner has in respect of an infringement of copyright‚Äô.34
This applies even, it would seem, if the circumventer
does not know (and has no reason to believe) that it will
be used to make infringing copies. Nevertheless, the pro-
vision does not seem to explicitly constitute the circum-
vention as a copyright infringement, but simply provides
for the existence of ‚Äòthe same rights‚Äô where such circum-
vention takes place. As such, it cannot be said with cer-
tainty that the circumvention of protection measures is a
property interference for which authority must be
sought. If it is not, a potentially important lacuna has
been left in the system by which copyright works are
protected.

b. Issues beyond the IPT‚Äôs judgment

The IPT judgment offers a hint of another potential av-
enue for accommodating national security concerns
within the copyright framework, in noting that counsel
for the claimants had raised (but did not pursue) the
implications of the InfoSoc Directive.35 No further in-
dication is given as to what the argument would have
been. The relevant Skeleton Argument, reproduced on
Privacy International‚Äôs website,36
the
claimant‚Äôs argument was based on the proper interpre-
tation of the ‚Äòpublic security‚Äô copyright exceptions in
light of the Directive‚Äôs three-step test. The exception in

suggests

that

26 Relevant parts of the Equipment Interference Code of Practice give some

indication of how information obtained by hacking might be used‚Äî
including copied, and disseminated‚Äîwhich potentially overlaps with the
economic rights of a copyright owner. See Privacy International,
Appendix II.

27 The court in Ashdown v Telegraph Group [2002] Ch 157 is clear that ‚ÄòThe
infringement of copyright constitutes interference with ‚Äúthe peaceful en-
joyment of possessions‚Äù. . .‚Äô at [28] (Phillips MR). Note that the CDPA
makes the infringement of copyright actionable and makes the same reme-
dies available as those for the ‚Äòinfringement of any other property right‚Äô
CDPA, s 96(2).

28 Eg right to reproduce the work in s 17 CDPA, right to communicate the

work to the public in s 18 CDPA.

29 Copying a work without the permission of the copyright owner is pro-
hibited: CDPA, s 17(2). It is unclear whether hacking itself would result

in the computer program (as a literary work) being ‚Äòstor[ed] . . . by elec-
tronic means‚Äô.

30 A separate protection scheme exists for computer programs in s 296

CDPA which is rather more limited than that protection other forms of
authorial works.

31 CDPA, s 296.
32 Note that elsewhere in the CDPA ‚Äòpublication‚Äô is deÔ¨Åned to mean the ‚Äòis-

sue of copies to the public‚Äô: CDPA, s 175(1)(a).

33 CDPA, s 296ZA(1).
34 CDPA, s 296ZA(3).

‚ÄòAn argument in relation to the possible impact of the EU Copyright
Directive (2001/29/EC), raised by Mr Jaffey in his pleadings and his skel-
eton argument, was not pursued‚Äô: Privacy International, [29].

‚Äòuse for the purposes of public security or to ensure the
proper performance or reporting of administrative, par-
liamentary or judicial proceedings‚Äô. The exception must
be viewed in the context of Recital 34 in the preamble
to the InfoSoc Directive whereby EU Member States
may include a ‚Äòpublic security‚Äô
limitation or excep-
tion.37 The reference to ‚Äòpublic security‚Äô, however, was
merely mentioned in the Skeleton Argument in the
context of the reverse engineering of software, ‚Äòpresum-
ably with a view to developing malware‚Äô.38 SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
the claim was that reverse engineering of software did
not meet the three-step test in Article 5(5) of the
Directive because it would conÔ¨Çict with the relevant
works‚Äô normal exploitation, therefore ensuring that the
alleged infringer could not take advantage of the secu-
rity exception. Whether or not it is correct that a UK
court must address the three-step test directly,39 it
seems that the existence of a power to interfere with
copyright for national security purposes would never-
theless be compatible with the Directive: Article 9 pro-
vides that the Directive is, amongst other areas of law,
‚Äòwithout prejudice to provisions concerning . . . secu-
rity‚Äô, a formulation which would encompass warrants
issued under section 5 ISA 1994.40 Consideration of the
InfoSoc Directive therefore seems to add nothing to the
question viewed solely as a matter of domestic law. The
claimants were correct not to press the point.

The IPT‚Äôs judgment does not address the implications
of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)
for the question of interference with IP rights (though
much of it is concerned with the Article 8 implications
of CNE as a form of property interference generally).
The right to peaceful enjoyment of one‚Äôs possessions is
protected by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the
Convention (A1P1), and IP can certainly be such a pos-
session,41 having
value which the
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has placed
at the heart of that concept. The interference with IP

economic

the

would, in turn, undoubtedly constitute ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô (rather
than deprivation)42 of one‚Äôs possession. Nevertheless,
both the plain text of the Convention and the (not
wholly equivalent)43 interpretation given to it by the
Strasbourg court are relatively generous in the conditions
they create for the justiÔ¨Åcation of any such control. For
the present purposes, it sufÔ¨Åces to note that paragraph 2
of A1P1 explicitly permits parties to the Convention to
‚Äòenforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the
use of property in accordance with the general interest‚Äô,
a formulation which would undoubtedly include laws
(such as ISA 1994) enacted to promote the interests (or,
if they are not the same thing, the apprehended interests)
of national security. Though the question of the propor-
tionality of a particular interference is of course fact-
sensitive, any court determining the issue would be slow
to disagree‚Äîin this most sensitive of contexts‚Äîwith the
assessment of the political decision-maker. This conclu-
sion applies also to those other forms of intangible prop-
erty, discussed later in this article,
interference with
which would seem to be similarly possible under a sec-
tion 5 ISA warrant.

c. Other IP rights

The basic conclusion of the IPT has implications for
other intangible rights, such as patents, designs and reg-
istered trade marks,44 all of which are property rights
and so might be infringed under the authority of a law-
fully issued section 5 ISA 1994 warrant (even if the ne-
cessity of interfering with trade marks and designs for
national security purposes may seem less likely). A fur-
ther question of interest here, however, is whether the
information accessed by GCHQ through hacking is (or
might under certain circumstances be treated as) prop-
erty. This question is important because of the possibil-
ity that in at least some contexts, the acquisition of
information via hacking will be a tortious act‚Äîwhether
breach of conÔ¨Ådence or the misuse of private informa-
tion‚Äîfor which legal authority is required. If it is not

technological protection measures. See also, regarding databases, the

the case, however, that information is property, then
that prima facie tort cannot be directly authorized by a
warrant under section 5 ISA 1994; if authorized at all, it
must be so because it is a necessary incident of an au-
thorized and therefore lawful interference either with
physical or intellectual property. This potentially be-
comes relevant, in turn, where there is a temporal sepa-
ration between the original act of property interference
authorized in a warrant and the consequent acquisition
or communication of conÔ¨Ådential information facili-
tated by that act. In short, section 5 ISA 1994 authorizes
interferences with property and yet the status of conÔ¨Å-
dential information, indeed any information, as prop-
erty is uncertain. Relevant ECtHR and UK case law
indicates that conÔ¨Ådential information is property on
the basis of having an economic value.45 Yet, as Aplin
argues, conÔ¨Ådential information is not like other forms
of IP: for example ‚Äòthere are weak grounds to classify
trade secrets as a ‚Äúpossession‚Äù on the basis of its trans-
ferability‚Äô.46 Tellingly, the Trade Secrets Directive47 re-
quires Member States to protect such information
without requiring the protection to take the form of a
property right.48 If, however, conÔ¨Ådential information
is property, the implication of the IPT judgment is that
it would apply to conÔ¨Ådential information in the same
way as to other intangible property, that is, that such
interference could be authorized by a warrant under
section 5 ISA 1994.49

Furthermore, a distinction must be drawn between
merely accessing information and disclosing that infor-
mation to others. As Aplin argues, by reference to dicta
in Hellewell v Chief Constable of Derbyshire,50 it is the
disclosure of
information that would give rise to a
breach of conÔ¨Ådence.51 The issue as it relates to investi-
gations of a national security nature is that insofar as
conÔ¨Ådential
it is not
likely to be disclosed in the manner of the ‚Äòmugshot‚Äô in
Hellewell, as doing so would be likely to be in breach of
the arrangements which ISA 1994 (and its 1989

information is interfered with,

predecessor) require to be put in place and to which
the Secretary of State must be satisÔ¨Åed that any infor-
mation obtained via property interference will be sub-
ject.52 It is likely in any event that in the case of
disclosure, a public interest defence would be avail-
able,53 particularly if that disclosure takes place in ac-
cordance with the relevant statutory limitations, which
tie permissible disclosure to the statutory functions of
the security services. In light of the relevant case law, it
is also clear that photographs taken in secret, for in-
stance, would not in and of themselves constitute a
misuse of private information.54 This means that there
will in many cases be, at the precise point at which in-
formation is accessed via hacking, no tortious act which
requires authorization under a section 5 warrant. Even
where there is a requirement for such authorization,
however, it is likely to be considered to be provided by
the underlying warrant justifying the relevant interfer-
ence with physical property.55 Finally, while conÔ¨Åden-
tial
information may or may not attract A1P1
protection as a possession,56 conÔ¨Ådential information
(whether personal or private) may also be protected by
Article 8 ECHR. Given, however, that the conditions of
justiÔ¨Åed interference are broadly equivalent, there is
likely to be no issue in terms of the justiÔ¨Åcation avail-
able for the interference.

3. Other avenues relevant to national
security infringement

In this section we consider other legal rules which may
have a parallel effect to the use of a section 5 warrant,
and discuss the reasons for which the ISA 1994 will be
preferred, where it is available to use.

the time of

interference was ancillary to an interference with tangi-
ble property‚Äîthe IPT states that that ‚Äò[a] s.5 warrant is
as sufÔ¨Åcient authority for such interference as is s.50 of
the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988‚Äô.57 That
section provides that ‚Äò[w]here the doing of a particular
act is speciÔ¨Åcally authorised by an Act of Parliament,
whenever passed, then, unless the Act provides other-
wise, the doing of that act does not infringe copy-
right.‚Äô58 Parliamentary debate at
the
enactment of the CDPA indicated that ‚Äò[t]he exception
in Clause 50 is intended to apply only when some par-
ticular act is authorised by an Act of Parliament.‚Äô59 Two
points can be made about this provision. The Ô¨Årst is
that‚Äîif the IPT intends section 50 to buttress its prior
conclusion, that IP is property of a kind with which in-
terference may be authorized under a section 5 ISA
1994 warrant‚Äîit is unclear exactly what work section
50 CDPA does in providing authorization for the in-
fringement of copyright. That is, the IPT fails to con-
sider the speciÔ¨Åc terms of
in
particular, the reference to an act being ‚ÄòspeciÔ¨Åcally
authorised‚Äô (emphasis added). It seems too great a
stretch to suggest either that interference with IP is spe-
ciÔ¨Åcally authorized by section 5 (which is of course not
the same as suggesting that it is not, contrary to the
IPT‚Äôs conclusion, authorized at all) or that any particu-
lar interference carried out under a warrant issued un-
der that provision is speciÔ¨Åcally authorized by it. If the
invocation of section 50 CDPA is intended to reafÔ¨Årm
the original conclusion, it does not make any useful
contribution to doing so.

the provision and,

More generally, however, on a careful consideration
of its terms, we see that section 50 CDPA has no legal
effect of its own. It simply recognizes the basic truth
that legal rights encompass correlative legal relations‚Äî
explicitly permitting one party to do a certain act is log-
ically incompatible with any other party having the
power to stop that act being done. The relevant ‚Äòact‚Äô
must either be authorized by statute (section 50(1)
CDPA) or under some other ‚Äòdefence of statutory au-
thority otherwise available under or by virtue of any en-
actment‚Äô (section 50(3) CDPA). That is, section 50(1)
CDPA does not itself authorize anything, but merely
makes provision as to the effect of acts authorized else-
where on the statute book. This is particularly impor-
tant in light of the fact that, on the best reading of the
IPT‚Äôs
as

section 50 not

judgment,

identiÔ¨Åes

it

the possibility of

conÔ¨Årming the correctness of its conclusion as to the ef-
fect of the 1994 Act, but instead as providing a parallel
basis of lawful interference with copyright (‚Äò[a] s.5 war-
rant is as sufÔ¨Åcient authority for such interference as is
s.50 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988‚Äô).60
It does not do so because, only recognizing the effect of
authority found elsewhere, it cannot provide authority
for anything not otherwise authorized. The invocation
of section 50 CDPA here is therefore doubly vacuous
and the better view must be that a lawfully issued sec-
tion 5 ISA 1994 warrant would sufÔ¨Åce to ensure that
any interference with a relevant ‚Äòwork‚Äô carried out un-
der it would not constitute an infringement of copy-
right, whether or not
statutorily
authorized interference was recognized by the terms of
the CDPA. This view is supported in Copinger, which
notes that the inclusion of section 50 in the CDPA was
unnecessary given that with a statutory authority de-
fence it always would have been the case that an in-
fringement speciÔ¨Åcally authorized in another statute
would have the effect of providing a defence to copy-
right infringement.61 This redundancy of section 50 has
important
implications for interferences with other
forms of IP rights such as patent, design and trade
mark rights and rights relating to conÔ¨Ådential informa-
tion, where‚Äîeven in the absence of a provision equiva-
lent to section 50 CDPA‚Äîotherwise infringing acts will
be lawful if done in accordance with a section 5 war-
rant. This is not to say that section 50 is entirely with-
out signiÔ¨Åcance; in particular, it is likely to be helpful
in countering any argument that the enactment of the
CDPA impliedly repealed powers of interference with
copyright contained within statutes enacted prior to the
CDPA itself. Its inclusion can for that reason be seen
as‚Äîif nothing else‚ÄîconÔ¨Årming that such powers per-
sist notwithstanding the new statutory framework for
copyright.

Finally (and putting this apparent redundancy to
one side temporarily), the ambit of section 50 remains
unclear as, apart from the IPT judgment under discus-
sion here (which does not elaborate on the alleged abil-
ity of
the provision to constitute authority for a
copyright infringement), the issue of ‚Äòstatutory author-
ity‚Äô does not seem to have been considered elsewhere in
the copyright case law. Indeed there is very limited dis-
cussion of section 50 in the legal literature generally.
One exception is a study of freedom of information,

which identiÔ¨Åes copyright as a potential obstacle to re-
sponding to FOI requests because to respond would re-
quire the copying of the requested documents.62 The
argument made is that the Freedom of Information Act
2000 (FOIA) must authorize the copying of documents
(in the manner foreseen by section 50) because to do
otherwise would prevent that statute from operating as
intended.63 This argument may be undermined in part
by the reference that the 2000 Act makes‚Äîin sections
11A, 11B and 19‚Äîto the use to which copyright-
protected material released thereunder may be put64 (in
the sense that the speciÔ¨Åc provision undermines any
claim that there exist implied rules of a broader scope).
It nevertheless remains true that, in some cases, mate-
rial which the relevant public authority (as opposed to
the party to whom it is released, with whose use of the
material sections 11A, 11B and 19 is concerned) might
be required to release in accordance with the FOIA
could not be released if to copy that material was not
taken to be permitted by the 2000 Act. Furthermore,
with respect to the speciÔ¨Åc issue of copyright infringe-
ment for national security ends, the lack of engagement
with section 50 CDPA in the case law and academic lit-
erature might be explained by the nature of national se-
curity investigations themselves. The relevant acts, such
as
Privacy
International, are unlikely either to affect the market for
a copyright work or to come to the attention of a per-
son with the capacity and will to challenge the legality
of what may be a prima facie breach of their IP rights.

b. National security and Crown use of patents

The Patents Act 1977 (PA 1977) makes provision as to
the use of patented inventions by the Crown that
would‚Äîalthough national security is not explicitly re-
ferred to‚Äîbe likely to offer a defence to any patent in-
fringements occurring as part of
the intelligence
services‚Äô counter-terrorism work.65 A contrast, though,
can be drawn between section 50 CDPA and the most
relevant provision, section 55 PA 1977.66 Where section

62

and Effective Freedom of Information Regime?‚Äô (2005) 1(4) Freedom of
Information 3.
Ibid, 6.

63
64 The sections concern datasets, fees for the use of data sets and publica-
tion schemes respectively. Note that s 80(3) FOIA refers speciÔ¨Åcally to s
50 CDPA in order to make clear that s 50 applies also to the Freedom of
Information (Scotland) Act 2002. However, this, like s 50 itself, would
seem to be redundant.

65 We do not suggest that the CNE in question would have constituted a
patent infringement or patent infringements. In particular, computer
programs are not patentable subject matter: PA 1977, s 1(2)(c).

66 Amongst other relevant sections ‚ÄòCrown use‚Äô is covered in ss 55‚Äì9 PA

1977.

50 CDPA appears to be redundant, section 55 PA 1977
does offer an alternative ground on which to defend
property interference as it relates to patented inven-
tions. It provides that a government department (or a
person ‚Äòauthorised in writing by a government depart-
ment‚Äô)67 may, for example, use an invention without
the patent owner‚Äôs consent‚Äîsomething which would
otherwise be an infringement of that person‚Äôs rights.68
This provision is potentially relevant to the kinds of na-
tional
security operations under discussion here.
Though the security services are not part of any govern-
ment department, they operate under the authority of
the Home Secretary (in MI5‚Äôs case) and the Foreign
Secretary (in MI6 and GCHQ‚Äôs case) and so might
plausibly be ‚Äòauthorised‚Äô by the departments headed by
those persons.69

A potential difÔ¨Åculty presents itself in relation to
whether national security purposes are of a kind cov-
ered by the provision, and if so what limits might exist
upon the Crown‚Äôs use of patented inventions. Section
56 PA 1977 relates to the interpretation of the terms of
Crown use and, for our purposes, identiÔ¨Åes as part of
‚Äòthe services of the Crown‚Äô, ‚Äòthe supply of anything for
foreign defence purposes‚Äô in section 56(2)(a) PA 1977.
It is not immediately clear that this would cover use for
purposes associated with internal security; this would
appear to be a foreign defence purpose in a very attenu-
ated form, and in any event section 56(3) PA 1977 de-
Ô¨Ånes
the
relevant provision does not claim to be exhaustive, but
merely ‚Äòincludes‚Äô foreign defence as a relevant service.71
Better, therefore, to read that provision as intended to
dispel any doubts about whether foreign defence falls
within ‚Äòthe services of the Crown‚Äô and as therefore rep-
resenting a tacit acceptance that domestic national se-
curity endeavours would undoubtedly do so. The case
law offers relatively little guidance on this issue, with
much of it concerned with disputes over pharmaceuti-
cals and public health, and even then infrequently.72
Therefore, assuming a product or process is ‚Äòused‚Äô for
national security purposes, it would be highly likely‚Äîif

‚Äòforeign defence‚Äô narrowly.70 However,

suitably authorized‚Äîto fall within the scope of Crown
use, and consent would not need to be sought in re-
spect of any uses of patented inventions by the intelli-
gence services. The use would in those circumstances
not constitute property interference of a sort requiring
distinct authorization under section 5 ISA.

(Magherafelt) Ltd v Ministry

Two other points are of relevance here. The Ô¨Årst is
that of compensation. Assuming national security use by
the intelligence services is Crown use under section
55 PA 1997, the question remains as to whether compen-
sation may be sought by the proprietor of the patent. In
Henry Brothers
of
Defence73‚Äîregarding co-ownership and the revocation
of a patent for a pre-fabricated, bomb-proof building‚Äî
this question was considered and the plaintiff, as (al-
leged) co-owner of the patent, was denied compensation
for the invention‚Äôs use because the Crown was in fact the
owner of the patent in question.74 Where ownership is
not in dispute, and the invention has not been previously
‚Äòrecorded or tried‚Äô by the government department, then
section 55(4) requires that terms be agreed with the pat-
ent proprietor and approved by the Treasury.75 A sec-
ond, and prior, question is whether the use of the
invention would come to the attention of the proprietor
at all. Section 55(7) PA 1977 requires the owner of the
patent that is being used by the Crown under that provi-
sion to be notiÔ¨Åed of its use, either ‚Äòas soon as practica-
ble‚Äô after use or after the grant of the patent, if use
begins before then.76 However, this requirement of noti-
Ô¨Åcation is subject to an exception in circumstances in
which ‚Äòit appears to the department that it would be
contrary to the public interest to do so‚Äô.77 Maintaining
secrecy of such use on national security grounds would
undoubtedly be a matter of signiÔ¨Åcant public interest‚Äî
since to notify of a use may reveal aspects of security ser-
vice operations78‚Äîthus obviating the need for notiÔ¨Åca-
tion and (in turn, and more problematically) any
compensation which may be required to be paid to the
owner for the use being made of the invention.79 In any
event, insofar as the 1994 Act offers a means by which to
justify interference with a patent (including, for the pre-
the patented
sent purposes, unlicensed use

invention)‚Äîas
would seem to demonstrate is possible‚Äîthere exists a
method by which the security services might evade any
and all requirements of notiÔ¨Åcation and compensation,
for neither of which ISA 1994 makes provision. Whether
the preference of the security services is to avail them-
selves of an authorization under the PA 1977 or a war-
rant under ISA 1994 is of course difÔ¨Åcult to know. No
Ô¨Ågures seem to exist regarding the number of such au-
thorizations issued and details as to ISA warrants are
only given at a level of generality that makes it impossi-
ble to know how many might be granted relating to IP.
Nevertheless, on consideration of the relevant statutory
frameworks, we see that there are compelling reasons for
which the security services will prefer, if at all possible, to
make use of the authority of the 1994 Act, leaving the
speciÔ¨Åc provisions of the PA 1977 to actors‚Äîthe police
may be one example‚Äîwho cannot avail themselves of
the ISA‚Äôs broad powers, or for situations in which the re-
quirements of the 1994 Act are not met.

c. National security and Crown use of designs

As is the case with patents, speciÔ¨Åc exceptions to rules
regarding infringement exist for Crown use of UK
unregistered designs. The relevant provision is found in
section 240(1) CDPA, which enables a government de-
partment (or an individual so authorized, again allow-
ing the security services to beneÔ¨Åt
from them) to
supply and dispose of articles ‚Äòfor the services of the
Crown‚Äô. Unlike in the PA 1977,
the deÔ¨Ånition of
‚ÄòCrown use‚Äô offered here is exhaustive, but also unlike
the PA 1977, national security can be easily read as a
permitted Crown use, section 240(2)(a) listing ‚Äòdefence
of the realm‚Äô80‚Äîthe historically preferred legal phras-
ing‚Äîas a relevant service of the Crown. Where use of a
design that would otherwise be infringing is made, sec-
tion 241 CDPA requires setting of terms for the use of
the design but, again, the relevant department may elect
not to do so where it ‚Äòappears to the department it
would be contrary to the public interest‚Äô. The public in-
terest here, as with patented inventions, might easily be

Ie in the setting of agreed terms: PA 1977, s 55(4). Note, however, that
compensation does not need to be provided in certain cases, namely the
recording of the invention by the government department before its pri-
ority date: PA 1977, s 55(3).

80 The subsection refers also includes ‚Äòforeign defence purposes‚Äô and ‚Äòhealth
service purposes‚Äô as ‚Äòservices to the Crown‚Äô: CDPA, s 240(2). Section 244
CDPA also provides a speciÔ¨Åc exception for use during emergencies
which would not seem to be relevant to intelligence services‚Äô operations
generally.

interpreted so as to include national security concerns.
Yet it is unclear how, and why, designs might be used
in national security investigations or, more broadly, to
achieve national security ends. Similarly to UK unregis-
tered designs, schedule 1 of the Registered Designs Act
1949 (RDA) also makes provisions for Crown use. Here
too, however, in those circumstances‚Äîpresumably rela-
tively few‚Äîin which it is necessary to infringe design
rights for national security purposes, the provisions of
the ISA 1994 offer clear advantages over those of the
CDPA and RDA.

4. National security and the public
interest in subsistence and enforcement

In this Ô¨Ånal section, we consider brieÔ¨Çy those other
ways in which national security considerations might be
given effect in IP law, with reference not to special rules
of justiÔ¨Åcation for what would otherwise be infringing
use, but to rules which permit the refusal to Ô¨Ånd that a
property right exists to begin with (ie rules affecting
subsistence) or the refusal to enforce IP rights on
grounds other than those discussed earlier in this arti-
cle. Here, the relevant rules are not of exclusive rele-
vance to national security, but encompasses it via
reference to the public interest generally.

a. The public interest defence in copyright

Assuming that a given act constitutes an infringement of
copyright and therefore an interference with a property
right, the question arises of whether there might exist in
law‚Äîbeyond the statutory authority which the 1994 Act
seems able to provide‚Äîa way for the alleged infringer to
avoid liability. One possibility is that agents of the state
engaging in activities constituting a prima facie copyright
infringement could seek to take advantage of section
171(3) CDPA, which provides that ‚Äò[n]othing in this
Part affects any rule of law preventing or restricting the
enforcement of copyright, on grounds of public interest
or otherwise.‚Äô81 This point was not raised in Privacy
International but is worth considering in the context of
the broader national security issues raised not only by

81 Note also the existence of a public order power in Article 17 Berne

Convention but this‚Äîalthough referring to national security interests‚Äî
seems to relate to censorship rather than interference with copyright. See
also Sam Ricketson, WIPO Study on Limitations and Exceptions of
Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Environment, Standing
Committee On Copyright And Related Rights, Ninth Session, Geneva, 23
to 27 June 2003, 75.

82 On the nature of the public interest defence see J. GrifÔ¨Åths, ‚ÄòPre-Empting

ConÔ¨Çict ‚Äì a Re-Examination of the Public Interest Defence in UK
Copyright Law‚Äô (2014) 34 LS 1‚Äì27.

hacking but by the intelligence services‚Äô and other gov-
ernment work that (potentially) interferes with IP. The
key question here is whether the formulation of section
171(3) CDPA implies that such rules necessarily exist
(and so creates them if they do not already do so), or in-
stead only preserves those rules if they contingently exist
it.82 Indeed, section 171(3) CDPA
independently of
came into force after the common law had already recog-
nized a public interest defence to infringement.83
Whatever the current status of the public interest as a de-
fence or ground for refusal to enforce copyright in the
(allegedly) infringed work, section 5 ISA 1994 provides a
potentially much broader avenue for the effective autho-
rization of interferences with copyright as property with
respect to the security services. In its absence, a consider-
ation of the public interest may lead the court to either
refuse to enforce the copyright in a relevant work be-
cause the work itself is wrongful, or to Ô¨Ånd a defence to
infringement exists because, in particular, a disclosure of
the work was in the public interest.

In the case of a prima facie copyright infringement
not explicitly sanctioned by a speciÔ¨Åc statute such as
the ISA 1994, a court may nevertheless excuse that act
by, for example, refusing to enforce copyright because
to do so would be ‚Äòinjurious to public life, public health
and safety. . .‚Äô.84 With respect to the refusal to enforce,
dicta in Spycatcher, for example, suggest that the con-
duct of a work‚Äôs author (in this case breaching the
OfÔ¨Åcial Secrets Act in publishing an autobiography)
might be considered ‚Äòdisgraceful‚Äô, such that the court
for that reason declines to Ô¨Ånd that copyright subsists
in the relevant work.85 Any such judicial approach
would be of particular interest to agents of law enforce-
ment other than the security services, whose speciÔ¨Åc
statutory powers of property interference are either far
more limited than those of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, or
do not exist. Seeing that a restriction‚Äîon national se-
curity grounds‚Äîon the enforcement of IP rights is con-
templated in the InfoSoc Directive (as discussed earlier
in this article), it is also possible to argue that even if a
public interest defence falls outwith the defences con-
templated by Article 586 that it may instead be covered
by Article 9 of the InfoSoc Directive.87

However, if the works being interfered with through
hacking are not in and of themselves wrongful, it will be
necessary to ask whether any disclosure was in the public
interest. That fact would potentially be relevant here, be-
cause, as the Court of Appeal of England and Wales
found in Ashdown, disclosure of a copyright work which
is necessary for a public interest purpose may activate
the public interest defence.88 To the extent that the secu-
rity services may be disclosing evidence of wrongdoing‚Äî
of a kind contemplated in Lion Laboratories v Evans89‚Äî
the public interest defence is likely to succeed. And as
GrifÔ¨Åths notes in this regard, ‚Äò[t]he [public interest] de-
fence has not traditionally been restricted to the func-
tions of promoting public security or reporting current
events.‚Äô90 Yet it would seem that hacking is likely to lead
to the copying and disclosure of material of a kind that
is not in and of itself ‚Äòwrongful‚Äô, and to that extent there
are no clear parallels with Lion Laboratories available.
That is, we are concerned here not with the conduct of
the copyright owner, but solely with the motivation of
the (alleged) infringer. We are left then with Mance LJ‚Äôs
observation in Hyde Park v Yelland that the application
of
the public interest defence cannot be precisely
categorized.91 Indeed, Phillips MR in Ashdown rejects the
narrow view of Aldous LJ in Hyde Park v Yelland with
respect to the scope of the public interest defence, prefer-
ring Mance LJ‚Äôs position on this point.92 We would ar-
gue that
the infringement of copyright on national
security grounds, especially given that the meaning of
the public interest remains broadly undeÔ¨Åned, would
almost certainly fall within the ambit of a public interest
defence despite not Ô¨Åtting neatly into existing categories
covered in the case law and despite the fact that in a hy-
pothetical case, the infringement would not take place in
the context of a disclosure to the public (to which the
present case law mostly relates).93

b. The public interest in patent and design law

Patent law does not operate a public interest defence as
such but, in respect of the rules regulating patentable
subject matter, the public interest (broadly conceived)

rights, utility models, . . . trade secrets, security, conÔ¨Ådentiality, data pro-
tection and privacy . . .‚Äô (emphasis added).

is‚Äîin the ‚Äòpublic policy and morality‚Äô exception to pat-
entability‚Äîa crucial element in determining whether
property rights in the form of a patent will be granted
over a particular invention.94 The question for us is
whether the protection of national security presents it-
self as a relevant consideration at the examination stage.
The case law regarding public policy and morality (or
ordre public and morality) has tended to focus on the
inventions.95 At the
patentability of biotechnological
European level, the European Patent OfÔ¨Åce approach to
patentable subject matter does reÔ¨Çect concerns with se-
curity. The EPO Technical Board of Appeal considers
Art 53(a) and public security in Plant Genetic Systems,96
saying ‚ÄòIt is generally accepted that the concept of
‚Äúordre public‚Äù covers the protection of public security
and the physical integrity of individuals as part of soci-
ety.‚Äô97 The EPO Guidelines refer to the kind of inven-
tions falling under that heading as those:
‚Äòlikely to
induce riot or public disorder, or to lead to criminal or
other generally offensive behavior . . . Anti-personnel
mines are an obvious example.‚Äô98 With respect to the
kind
Privacy
International, it remains to be seen if a cybersecurity-
related product or process would be considered the
kind of invention that, due to its capacity to create pub-
lic disorder, would be denied patent protection. This
would, however, have to be a very particular case given
the plethora of benign technologies that might be used
for less than benign ends. A similar hurdle in terms of
providing IP right protection may be found in the law
relating to registered designs. Section 1D RDA provides
that ‚Äò[a] right in a registered design shall not subsist in
a design which is contrary to public policy or to ac-
cepted principles of morality.‚Äô99 The relevant RDA
schedule also identiÔ¨Åes speciÔ¨Åc categories that will be
excluded and does not provide for a national security
or similar exemption for the registration of designs be-
ing concerned instead with the protection of, primarily,
Ô¨Çags and emblems.100 Nevertheless, as with certain in-
ventions, we might imagine that an attempt to register
a design that would be prejudicial to national security

would be unsuccessful.101 Regarding the UK unregis-
tered design right in the CDPA, there is no speciÔ¨Åc na-
tional security exception but there is a public interest
provision in section 238 regarding the exercise of cer-
tain powers.102 That such rules might be employed for
the converse purpose of refusing a patent to some in-
vention which may be beneÔ¨Åcial to security‚Äîrather
than refusing it because it is harmful thereto‚Äîseems
unlikely, but that question is of course less urgent in
the context of those provisions, described above, which
make it possible for the Crown to interfere with prop-
erty, or to use (or authorize others to use) such inven-
tions or designs. Better from a pragmatic point of view
to recognize the patent and then make Crown use of
it‚Äîwithout notice, if the public interest demands it.

Even where IP rights are recognized, considerations
of national security may see those rights treated differ-
ently within the relevant legal framework. The publica-
tion rules in the PA 1977 explicitly consider matters of
national security with allowing for the publication of
information that is ‚Äòprejudicial to national security‚Äô103
to be restricted under certain conditions. Moreover,
where such restrictions are in force a patent will not be
granted.104 Indeed, as the IPO itself points out, every
patent application is screened ‚Äòto identify any which
could be prejudicial to national security or public safe-
ty‚Äô.105 The UK Intellectual Property OfÔ¨Åce‚Äôs guidance is
provided on the types of inventions that may be viewed
as sensitive in terms of national security‚Äîfor example
relating to atomic energy, ‚Äò[c]ipher, code, encryption,
secrecy and privacy systems and devices‚Äô106‚Äîbut the
list is incomplete for being redacted, presumably also
on national security grounds. The application itself is
considered within the Security Section before being for-
warded, if no issues arise, for general examination.107
The decision to restrict the publication of the patent
application cannot be appealed.108 Similarly, section 5

RDA enables the publication of certain information re-
lating to designs ‚Äòrelevant for defence purposes‚Äô to re-
main secret. What we see in this overview of public
interest concerns in the regulation of patents and de-
signs in particular is that the capacity to take into ac-
count matters of national security is embedded in the
regulation of intangible assets from technical matters of
procedure to the recognition of subsistence and, Ô¨Ånally,
the availability of defences and damages when an in-
fringement does occur.

5. Conclusion

the security services,

Through the public interest defence, Crown use provi-
sions and rules relating to subsistence amongst others,
the existing IP regime offers a number of mechanisms
which may effectively legitimate interference with IP
for national security ends. The judgment of the IPT,
however, conÔ¨Årms that in the speciÔ¨Åc context of the
work of
there exist powers
which‚Äîin their breadth and their secrecy‚Äîare of po-
tentially far more signiÔ¨Åcance, and which apply not
just to copyright (as was the focus of the IPT‚Äôs judg-
ment) but, we have suggested,
IP rights.
Warrants granted under section 5 ISA 1994 enable the
security services to interfere with IP rights in a manner
that is both general and highly Ô¨Çexible, not requiring
them to seek to make use of existing subsistence and
compulsory licensing rules (as relevant) nor exposed
to the uncertainties inherent in providing an after-the-
fact defence to the infringement of IP rights. The mat-
ters

International are, given that judgments of the IPT can
be neither appealed109 nor‚Äîthe relevant statute sug-
gests‚Äîjudicially reviewed,110 likely to be the source of

Powers Act 2016, which sets out the framework for
new powers of ‚Äòequipment interference‚Äô111 (the new

scribed as CNE), which are both more intrusive and
subject to greater safeguards than are those contained
in the 1994 Act, but only for the purpose of obtaining

information. Those powers have, however, been left in-
tact and in fact extended by the Act, which amends
the ISA so as to permit property interference by MI6
and GCHQ in the British Islands even for the purpose
of preventing and detecting ‚Äòserious crime‚Äô.112 Given
the discussion in this article, this represents also an
important, and largely unaddressed,
extension of
powers of interference with IP.
