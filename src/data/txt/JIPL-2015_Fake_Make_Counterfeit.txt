Fake it ’til we make it: regulating dangerous
counterfeit goods
James L. Bikoff, David K. Heasley, Valeriya Sherman,
and Jared Stipelman*

The world’s most lucrative industry?
The world’s most
lucrative industry may well be
counterfeiting. According to some estimates, the trade
in counterfeit goods accounts for 10% of all global
trade and rakes in well over $500 billion per year.1
And counterfeiting extends far beyond handbags and
watches: today, anything and everything from electric-
al
fuses and car airbags to wine and prescription
pharmaceuticals is counterfeited—posing a major risk
to human health and safety. The global trade in dan-
gerous counterfeit goods has grown directly alongside
the trade in more traditional,
‘low-risk’ counterfeit
goods.

The numbers are stark: counterfeit or falsiﬁed
drugs directly cause 100,000 annual deaths in Africa
the World Health Organization estimates.2
alone,
Interpol places the number above one million world-
wide.3 Up to 30% of the world’s medicine supply4—
and an even higher proportion of drugs sold online5—
are counterfeit.6

The danger is not limited to pharmaceuticals. Car
manufacturer Aston Martin recently recalled 75% of its
global ﬂeet due to safety concerns over counterfeit plastic
parts.7 A recent epidemic of counterfeit, shatter-prone,
chemically treated ‘decorative’ contact
lenses has been

deaths caused directly by the drug poisoning—the ﬁgure is far higher when

causing consumers permanent eye damage.8 And counterfeit
semiconductors have become so commonplace that the
United States has added a new anti-counterfeiting rule to
its military procurement regulations after several recent
incidents involving military equipment with counterfeit
electronic parts.9

To turn the tide, consumer groups, industry stake-
holders, international organizations and governments
have begun proactively combating dangerous counterfeit
goods.10 But due to their relative novelty, these anti-
counterfeiting efforts have not been uniformly effective
in stemming the rapid growth of the global counterfeit-
ing industry.11

The authors of this article—through the European
Communities Trade Mark Association (ECTA)—soli-
cited information from private and governmental repre-
sentatives in 35 countries about the character and scope
of their efforts to combat dangerous counterfeit goods,
and have analysed the responses. Part 2 of this article
explains the survey methodology. Part 3 discusses how
four major international
trading areas—the United
States, the European Community, China and India—
combat dangerous counterfeits. Part 4 discusses enforce-
ment issues revealed by the survey responses, and identi-
ﬁes best practices for detecting and mitigating the risk
posed by dangerous counterfeits. Part 5 concludes with
recommendations for further action.

The survey method explained
No jurisdiction has fully solved its dangerous counterfeit
goods problem, but some have come closer than others.
Indeed, given the vast disparities in manpower, capital
and economic trajectory among different countries,
there is probably no ideal model.

Because there is no perfect model to emulate, the goal
of this article is to foster high-level discussions on the
best practices for addressing the problem of dangerous
fakes. As what constitutes a ‘dangerous counterfeit good’
is subjective, and the best practices to curb dangerous
counterfeiting vary with the prevailing economic, demo-

graphic and political circumstances in a jurisdiction, our
survey questions were deliberately open-ended. They
allowed responders to address whatever issues they found
most important, and to highlight the anti-dangerous-
counterfeiting policies they deemed most effective. Such
an approach allows many different perspectives to in-
ﬂuence the debate. Almost as importantly, the gaps and
silences in survey responses tend to reﬂect the gaps in
anti-counterfeiting enforcement.

The world’s main dangerous counterfeit
countermeasures
Dangerous counterfeit goods are both dangerous
and counterfeit, so most jurisdictions combat them
with a combination of consumer protection and intel-
lectual property laws. This approach creates multiple
layers of protection, but also increases the need for
coordination.

The American system
Although the United States has few laws that explicitly
target dangerous counterfeits, it excels in coordinating
different types of private and public enforcement actions,
resulting in a well-integrated anti-dangerous-counterfeiting
programme.

The United States’ regulation of dangerous goods—
counterfeit or not—incidentally regulates many danger-
ous counterfeit goods. For instance, the USA regulates
all pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),12 and regulates other
common dangerous substances (such as lead and asbes-
tos) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).13

through normal channels of

Dangerous counterfeit goods generally do not enter
the market
trade and
thereby avoid the inspections and restrictions mandated
by product safety laws, such as FIFRA and TSCA. To
help close this loophole, the USA allows certain private
actors to sue for counterfeiting under its Trademark
Act.14 Those found guilty risk criminal penalties15 and

massive damages.16 The potential for such large recover-
ies further motivates private companies to police the
marketplace and conduct their own investigations into
potential dangerous counterfeits.

Several other American laws and regulations also
contain anti-counterfeiting provisions meant to promote
cooperation between the public and private sectors. For
example, the Tariff Act broadly prohibits importation of
counterfeit goods, and allows entities whose rights are
infringed by counterfeit goods to coordinate with customs
ofﬁcials to seize suspected counterfeits.17 The private com-
panies record their trade mark registrations with the rele-
vant agencies, usually Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),
who then know what to look for when attempting to
seize counterfeit goods at the border.18 The National In-
tellectual Property Rights Coordination Center further
synchronizes administrative actions, and various organiza-
tions use this information to warn consumers of poten-
tially dangerous counterfeits.19

The United States—like many other countries—sup-
plements its general regime with speciﬁc legislation tar-
geting dangerous counterfeit goods it deems particularly
dangerous. For instance, the Food and Drug Safety Innov-
ation Act20 imposes signiﬁcant obligations on manufac-
turers to avoid adulteration and enhances the penalties
for counterfeiting drugs. Individual US states also often
craft their own legislation to arrest the ﬂow of particular
dangerous counterfeits, such as car airbags.21

The European system
The European continent contains 50 countries, each with
its own unique legal system. However, harmonizing inﬂu-
ences—notably the European Union (EU)—have led many
European countries to combat dangerous counterfeit
goods in similar ways.

Like the United States, most European jurisdictions
do not regulate ‘dangerous counterfeit goods’ spe-
ciﬁcally; rather,
they regulate dangerous products
and counterfeit products as separate, but overlapping,
issues. Most European states enforce their prohibitions
against dangerous goods through customs inspections
(for imports) or in domestic laboratories, under do-
mestic law (for goods produced internally). If the certi-
fying state is an EU member, the products can then be
distributed throughout the EU without further inspec-
tion.22 If a non-food product is dangerous to the envir-
onment, consumer health or national security, then
the EU’s rapid response system, RAPEX,23 allows for
close coordination of enforcement efforts among EU
member states.

European anti-counterfeiting laws have converged sig-
niﬁcantly because EU membership and various inter-
national treaties have encouraged such alignment.24 Most
EU states have laws providing for both criminal and
private civil penalties for counterfeiting.25 Private indus-
tries frequently hold events to educate enforcement ofﬁ-
cials on how to identify particular counterfeit products.26

ARTICLE

If private companies provide speciﬁc information about
an incoming infringing product shipment, European
customs authorities will intercept the shipment.27

The EU further harmonizes European anti-dangerous-
counterfeiting laws with both directives that address
speciﬁc goods, such as dangerous toys,28 pharmaceuti-
cals, pesticides,29 food imitation30 and medical devices,31
and with directives that harmonize legal procedures in
intellectual property32 and product liability law.33 Many
European states also promulgate speciﬁc anti-dangerous-
counterfeiting laws. For instance, many European nations
have speciﬁc regulations concerning counterfeit food
and tobacco.

In addition to the EU’s internal efforts to promote
harmonization and cooperation, European states and private
entities participate prominently in global anti-counterfeiting
efforts through organizations like Interpol,34 Europol35
and the United Nations.36 Ultimately, the fact that one
can even discuss Europe as a single unit (as opposed to 50
disparate ones) speaks to Europe’s tremendous success in
standardizing its counterfeiting laws. Its regional system is
a blueprint for how to coordinate anti-counterfeiting laws
on a global scale.

The Chinese system
Any discussion of Chinese law prohibiting dangerous
counterfeiting must begin by acknowledging that some
Chinese businesses are among the world’s largest produ-
cers of adulterated and counterfeit products. Though the
full extent of Chinese counterfeiting is unknown, recent
high-proﬁle incidents involving counterfeit or unsafe
wine,37 baby formula,38 high-tech products39 and aero-
plane parts40 hint at the scope of the problem, which is
an open secret.41

The extent and proﬁtability of Chinese ‘fakes’42 constrain
the potential effectiveness of Chinese anti-counterfeiting
and dangerous product legislation. At the local and
regional
level, business and government are often so
intertwined that the local enforcement bodies ostensibly
responsible for enforcing anti-counterfeiting laws may
themselves proﬁt from the counterfeiting industry.43
Chinese federal authorities face comparable moral
hazards, in that they are further hamstrung by their reliance
on these same corrupt local ofﬁcials for information.44
And because a majority of Chinese counterfeit goods are
produced by legitimate factories working illegitimate ‘third
shifts’, it is frequently difﬁcult to shut down operations

27 See generally O Vrins, ‘Regulation 608/2013: towards a more effective

36 See eg, ‘Counterfeit: don’t buy into organized crime’ United Nations Ofﬁce

3, 118 and O Vrins, and M Schneider, Enforcement of Intellectual Property
Rights through Border Measures. Law and Practice in the EU, 2nd ed. (2012),
Oxford University Press (describing how private actors can ﬁle a customs
detention order (CDO) to alert EU customs ofﬁcials to potentially
infringing shipments). Most of our responders that discussed private –
public cooperation in interdiction required private entities to pay for all or
part of the expenses, such as storage and destruction costs. This sort of
barrier against private sector participation arguably chills customs
enforcement efforts.

that produce counterfeit goods.45 Finally, the sheer size of
China’s market and the scope of its counterfeiting problem
make enforcement difﬁcult.46 Even well-intentioned
product safety and anti-counterfeiting watchdogs are
overworked and of limited effectiveness.

Against that background, China,

like other major
regimes, regulates ‘dangerous counterfeit products’ through
a bifurcated scheme that regulates counterfeit products
and dangerous products separately. These legal regimes,
however, are often difﬁcult for foreign businesses to
access.47

Moreover, a lack of coordination between speciﬁc ad-
ministrative agencies inhibits enforcement. Infringement
claims against registered or ‘well-known’ Chinese trade
marks and other marks are investigated by different
agencies, none of which has the authority to regulate
dangerous products.48 Furthermore, as the statutes of
limitation on infringement claims and many product
safety claims are two years or less, litigants must choose
the right forum or risk losing the opportunity to bring
their claims.

Although civil litigants can recover statutory damages
under Chinese anti-counterfeiting law without proving
actual damages, criminal penalties are another matter.
For a counterfeiter to be subject to criminal penalties,
the prosecution must generally meet certain thresholds
of actual damage.49 Under the best circumstances, actual
damages are hard to prove, and when the counterfeited
goods are themselves inexpensive (such as foodstuffs),
their actual value may not even reach the predicate
threshold for criminal liability.50 This effectively immu-
nizes many dangerous counterfeiters from criminal pros-
ecution for injuries their counterfeiting has caused.

have a tremendous demand for cheap (frequently dan-
gerous) goods, and various Chinese government policies
actively encourage manufacture of inexpensive products.
Because a dangerous counterfeiting control programme
would be at cross-purposes with other Chinese econom-
ic policies, legislation seeking to control dangerous pro-
ducts frequently follows—rather than prevents—crises.
The paradigmatic example of this was the Chinese
tainted milk scandal.51 In 2008, melamine-tainted milk
powder produced by a well-known Chinese dairy manu-
facturer killed four infants and made hundreds of thou-
sands of others ill.52 Both the dairy and the Chinese
government knew of the issue beforehand, but legisla-
tion was passed only after the crisis.53 Moreover, the
regulatory response was arguably dysfunctional—part of
the government’s response was to effectively loosen the
deﬁnition of ‘milk’, lowering required protein levels to
remove the incentive for corrupt producers to add mela-
mine (a protein substitute) to their milk powder.54
Though such an approach might address the melamine
problem, it does not make the public healthier. All told,
China’s legal protection against counterfeit and danger-
ous goods—though improving—still lacks transparency,
consistency and effectiveness.

The Indian system
Although far from perfect,55 the Indian anti-counterfeit-
ing and anti-dangerous products regimes balance con-
sumer protection with the need for administrability.
Despite India’s size and relative poverty, aspects of its
system have garnered international praise from a variety
of sources.56

China has a variety of laws regulating dangerous pro-
ducts, but all subject to a caveat. Chinese consumers

India joins many other jurisdictions in regulating dan-
gerous counterfeits through legislation against dangerous

products and anti-counterfeiting laws.57 However, due to
India’s vast size and limited budget, Indian customs—to a
greater extent than most countries—cannot inspect every
single shipment of goods into the country. Accordingly,
India supplements its random inspections by requiring
shipments of ‘inherently dangerous cargo’ to submit to add-
itional scrutiny. India streamlines enforcement by requiring
that speciﬁc types of dangerous cargo enter India only via
certain ports. Such a rule allows for specialization among
customs ofﬁcials, and establishes easy grounds for suspicion
of any dangerous cargo that enters through the wrong port.
India coordinates internally through advanced track-and-
trace procedures for certain dangerous products.

India supplements its ofﬁcial procedures by inviting ex-
tensive private involvement. It has broad anti-counterfeiting
laws that contemplate both civil and criminal liability.58
Private parties can also ask domestic laboratories or
customs to test particular lots of potentially dangerous
goods, and can register their trade marks for ﬁve years with
Indian customs, thus alerting customs ofﬁcials to suspected
infringement and empowering them to act against it.59

Like many other countries, India supplements its
general scheme with policies regulating goods of special
concern, particularly agricultural products. And it
actively encourages regulated industries to self-regulate
voluntarily, which has resulted in numerous private
standard-setting bodies that are more responsive and
more protective than enacted laws.

respondents

Survey insights and best practices
Our
represent different countries and
various professional backgrounds, but most raised the
same concerns and described similar practices. A few of
these observations—shared by several responders—are
especially informative as to both the scope of the danger-
ous counterfeiting problem and potential ways forward.

Ingestible dangerous goods are more
prominent in anti-dangerous-counterfeiting
programmes than equally dangerous inedible
goods
Without fail, survey respondents focused on ingestible
substances—food, drink, tobacco or medicines—as the
main dangerous products worth regulating. Although
most governments regulate dangerous chemicals, electronics
and ﬁrearms, responders frequently did not include these

57 See eg, Guide to Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in India 2014,
supra note 55 at 5 (listing speciﬁc legislation to protect patents, trade
marks, copyrights, industrial designs, seeds and geographic indicators, and
to protect consumers from potentially harmful substances including
cosmetics, drugs and food adulterants).

kinds of product regulations in their answers; though the
dangers of these products are well-known, they are not fore-
most in the public consciousness. Going forward, more
effort needs to be expended educating both government
ofﬁcials and the public about non-ingestible dangerous
counterfeit products.

Successful consumer education efforts should
highlight personal safety risks of dangerous
counterfeit goods
The Italian respondent wisely observed that many efforts to
educate consumers about counterfeit goods have failed in
part because of how the message was framed. Counterfeit-
ing aids unlawful activity and harms legitimate businesses,
but many consumers are unmoved by such appeals to their
better nature. Indeed, the whole reason that counterfeiting
is so lucrative—and, in some instances, so dangerous—is
that consumers want goods far cheaper than the legitimate
market will bear. The most effective educational efforts
portray the product as undesirable by focusing on the grue-
some health and safety consequences of using poorly made
counterfeit goods. Anti-counterfeiting public education
and outreach efforts should thus focus on the personal—
not social—risks of using dangerous counterfeit goods.

Integrated product tracing systems could
leverage network effects to aid enforcement
A product that is dangerous to a Chilean person is just
as dangerous to a Danish or Indian person; laws differ,
but the nature of dangerous products remains the same.
Similarly, a counterfeit product is a counterfeit product
wherever it is sold—only the legal consequences differ.

Recognizing that danger from products transcends bor-
ders, the European Union’s RAPEX system allows for the
speedy and streamlined sharing of
information across
borders. India, the United States and others have their own
systems to accomplish similar ends within their own borders.
Any system that trades in information—which RAPEX
and its national equivalent systems surely do—becomes
exponentially more potent as it leverages network effects.
Since dangerous products are equally dangerous in all jur-
isdictions, anti-dangerous-products enforcement would
become more efﬁcient if the disparate systems were inte-
grated. An integrated system aimed at tracking and tracing
dangerous products could coexist
in harmony with
different substantive national laws. Everyone is warned
of the products, but no jurisdiction has to act on the

warnings. An international counterfeit tracing system
would likely yield beneﬁts similar to an international
dangerous product tracing system.

Cooperative international anti-counterfeiting
efforts have been largely successful and should
be expanded
The authors were struck by how similarities in anti-
counterfeiting and dangerous products enforcement
regimes vastly outweighed the differences—both sub-
stantively and procedurally. These similarities are prob-
ably attributable to the tremendous (and largely effective)
extent of international dialogue and cooperation on global
IP and product safety issues, both by governments and
private associations. Prompting and strengthening these
engagements is critical to the global effort to combat
dangerous counterfeit goods.60

Legislation should guide and complement
private enforcement efforts
Consumers bear the brunt of dangerous and counterfeit
goods; they are the ones who become ill or are harmed
by shoddy products. And if those consumers lose conﬁ-
dence in the legitimate brands that are counterfeited,
lawful private businesses—and even industries—suffer
the long-term effects of lost consumer goodwill. When
these businesses fail, everyone loses.

The upshot is that private businesses that have the most
to lose from rampant counterfeit and adulterated products
generally have the greatest means and motivation to
curtail counterfeiting. Anti-counterfeiting and dangerous
product legal regimes should engage the assistance of
these interested, knowledgeable and well-funded private
businesses in enforcement efforts. It appears that every
jurisdiction surveyed envisages public–private partner-
ships on IP enforcement, whether through private legal
action, cooperation between businesses and customs ofﬁ-
cials or educational efforts. Some regimes—such as China
(which limits damages for counterfeiting) or Ukraine
(where private entities foot the entire bill for intercepting
shipments)—inhibit private enforcement, thus limiting
their potential effectiveness. When possible, such barriers
to private enforcement should be eliminated.

Concluding remarks
Expensive, brand-named products become expensive,
brand-named products in part because of their superior

materials and manufacture; you get out what you put in.
Every day, more and more people become consumers,
and these new consumers are generally not wealthy. Yet
many want the same products as the global wealthy. To
them, the appeal of counterfeits is immense, and as such
the counterfeit problem is only going to grow.

Governments have the tools to respond, but too often
individual jurisdictions go it alone, employing unilateral
strategies to combat coordinated international counter-
feiting networks. We may not know what the best en-
forcement approach is, but that is not it. International
organizations should identify potential best practices and
start a conversation as to how to best implement these prac-
tices across jurisdictional boundaries. The public health
and safety consequences of the problem are simply too
great to ignore.

Appendix: Representative enforcement
actions
Alone or coordinated, spontaneous or planned, govern-
ment agencies tasked with preventing the ﬂow of danger-
ous counterfeits seize infringing goods every day. The
enforcement actions described below are representative:

1. After a multi-year investigation by numerous US law
enforcement agencies including the FBI, Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI), Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
and the Department of Defense (DoD), the owner and
four employees of Oregon-based defence contracting
ﬁrm Kustom Products, Inc. pleaded guilty on 18 July
2014 to fraudulently obtaining 750 DoD contracts
valued in excess of $10 million. Of these, one of the
most egregious—and the one that ultimately led to
their prosecution—related to counterfeit aviation lock-
nuts used in military ﬁghter jets. Kustom Products sup-
plied these counterfeit locknuts in 2008—sourced from
a known Texas-based counterfeiter—but military
supply chain protocols identiﬁed the fakes. Upon inves-
tigation, Kustom Products claimed to have delivered
locknuts from the ‘wrong bin’. However, when asked to
replace the counterfeit parts, Kustom Products sourced
identical locknuts from the same manufacturer. Under
the plea agreement, the defendants forfeited all pro-
ceeds attributable to the fraud, as well as various vehi-
cles, $365,000 and real property.61

2. Pursuant to an ICE investigation, an indictment was
ﬁled on 12 September 2014 charging two defendants

with ten counts related to a conspiracy to smuggle
four million misbranded and counterfeit pills into
the United States. According to the indictment, from
2007– 2010 Marla Ahlgrimm, a pharmacist from
Madison, Wisconsin and Balbir Bhogal, a Las Vegas
pharmacologist, illicitly contracted to acquire the
pills from an Indian drug counterfeiter. The defen-
dants allegedly purchased the pills to supply a Costa
Rican online pharmacy, but actually sold them dir-
ectly to consumers in the United States.62

3. On 27 January 2014, based on ﬁndings from an in-
vestigation by HSI, Hao Yang of Harrisburg, Penn-
sylvania pleaded guilty to trafﬁcking in counterfeit
goods, including counterfeit military-grade circuits
and avionics equipment. Pursuant to his plea deal,
he forfeited $59,000 in cash, a 2010 Acura and
various counterfeit items worth $280,720. He faces a
maximum of 10 years in prison.63

4. In a series of recalls dating back to May 2013, Aston
Martin has recalled 17,590 vehicles due to faulty
plastic throttle pedal arms. In a 15 January 2014
letter to the US National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration, Aston Martin revealed that the
defects stemmed from counterfeit plastics used by a
third-tier supplier. Although engineering speciﬁca-
tions supplied to Hong-Kong-based Fast Forward
Tooling required the use of brand-name DuPont plas-
tics, Fast Forward Tooling instead acquired its plastics
from Dongguan-based Synthetic Plastic Raw Material
Co. This recall affects nearly all 2008–2014 Aston
Martin models.64

5. On 12 June 2013, 34-year-old Jason Jordan pleaded
guilty to conspiracy to trafﬁc in counterfeit goods.
Between July 2010 and August 2012, Jordan im-
ported and sold counterfeit Ford, GM, Honda and
Toyota airbags over the internet, grossing nearly
$450,000. As part of a plea agreement, Jordan would
forfeit $57,000 in seized cash, pay a judgment of
$100,000 to the government and pay restitution in
the amount of $444,180.28. Prosecutors recom-
mended a prison sentence of 31 months. The safety

risks inherent in counterfeit airbags were considered
in the sentencing proposal.65

6. On 6 August 2013, two men were arrested and
charged with conspiring to smuggle and trafﬁc in
counterfeit and misbranded prescription medicine,
including Viagra. The investigation, conducted by
HSI and partners, identiﬁed the two men as engaged
in smuggling large shipments of Viagra from China
to the US. The suspects were apprehended when one
of them delivered approximately 17,000 counterfeit
and misbranded Viagra tablets to an undercover
agent who successfully inﬁltrated the counterfeit
pharmaceutical trafﬁcking organization.66

7. In a joint operation conducted with French customs,
the United States Custom and Border Patrol (CBP)
seized 480 shipments of counterfeit critical computer
components between 1 November 2012 and 30 April
2013. Operation Core Systems continued a line of
joint operations between French and US Customs ofﬁ-
cials, and served to highlight the threat to businesses
and public safety from counterfeit computer parts.67

8. Between 28 March and 8 April 2013, US CBP
ofﬁcials seized 14,904 toasters bearing counterfeit
Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL) safety marks. UL per-
forms vigorous safety tests on products to determine
potential risks from ﬁre, shock and other health
hazards, meaning the toasters with counterfeit UL
marks are potentially dangerous to consumers. The
seized toasters had a market value of $297,931.68

9. Between 5 May and 11 May 2014, an INTERPOL-led
anti-counterfeiting programme involving private
stakeholders and representatives from ten European,
Asian and North American countries netted over
$50 million of counterfeit products. The programme
resulted in the seizure of various types of counterfeit
goods, including cigarettes, cosmetics, alcohol, elec-
tronics and electrical parts, and led to hundreds of
arrests.69

in the UK, Spain, Romania and the Netherlands for
importing counterfeit drugs from Singapore and

China. The counterfeits included both generic and
name brands, and were laced with various poisonous
ﬁller ingredients.70

11. On 22 May 2014, a coordinated effort between Inter-
pol and the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) resulted in the seizure of
over $29 million of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and
10,603 websites. The effort was conducted as part of
Operation Pangaea VII, Interpol’s anti-counterfeit
pharmaceutical programme, and is believed to be the
largest-ever crackdown on illicit pharmaceuticals.71

12. As part of a massive Interpol– Europol-coordinated
effort conducted in December 2013 and January
2014, over 1,200 tons of counterfeit food, and
430,000 litres of counterfeit drink were seized from
locations in 33 countries. The seizures notably
included 131,000 litres of oil and vinegar, 45 tons of
dairy products, 60,000 bottles of fake champagne
and 685 tons of poorly preserved or mislabelled
seafood. The operation, dubbed Opson III, also
resulted in arrests in Spain, France, Vietnam, Thai-
land and the Philippines.72
