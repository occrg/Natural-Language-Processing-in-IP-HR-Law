Of the two values of ancient objects, the connoisseur’s ﬁrst concern is with the object today, and the
archaeologist’s is with its past place and the knowledge it offers about the past. Central to both is prove-
nance, which comprises the “archaeology” of the item—its story until it went to rest in the ground—
and its “history”—its story once found and brought to human awareness again. Our response to
looting of antiquities depends on how serious is the impact on knowledge, so we need a “quantitative
history” of collecting—how much there was to start with, how much has been dug up, how much
we know about it, how much remains. Four quantitative histories are reported: on Cycladic ﬁgures,
on items in recent celebrated classical collections, on antiquities sold at auction in recent decades, and
on classical collecting at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. These pioneering studies are not yet enough
to make a clear overall picture; our preliminary conclusion is a glum view of the damage caused by
the illicit pursuit of antiquities.

Ancient things exist today as objects in the present, which we ﬁnd attractive, beau-
tiful, strange, sinister, ugly, informative, enigmatic, or simply of no interest, ac-
cording to our emotional and cultural attitudes. The modern response may try to
follow closely the meaning of the object as it was known to its creators. That may
be more successful within one cultural tradition, such as those of Islamic or West-
ern art, where the modern eye can more reliably be informed and directed by
knowledge of and immersion within the same and continuing tradition of iconog-
raphy and of meaning. This way of valuing objects in the present, respected and

enjoyed for how we respond to them today, we can call the connoisseur’s value, for it
embodies the traditional connoisseur’s approach.

Although the connoisseur’s values may repeat today those which deﬁned the
meaning and value of an ancient object in its own time, there is no reason why they
must or should. Classical statuary was painted, yet modern values especially since
Winckelmann’s time have chosen instead to prefer the marble to be bare and white.1
The exalted regard we now hold for painted pottery as a high art in the ancient
Greek world does not match its lower relative value in its own time.2 The long fas-
cination which the West has found in ancient Egyptian things is not matched by
an informed knowledge of just what they meant and just how they functioned in
ancient Egyptian society. Living in a very different society without animal gods, we
see that most lovely red-stone baboon in the British Museum Egyptian galleries
ﬁrst as an image of the baboon as an animal. That remains the case—through
habit and cultural imprinting—even if we have diligently read the essential intro-
ductions to the singular structures of the ancient Egyptian worldview that precede
the scholarly accounts of ancient Egyptian art.3 When we do, we know to think
of it not ﬁrst as a sculpture of an animal, but of a spiritual being: Hapi, who
guards the lungs in one of the canopic burial jars and chances to take the physical
form of a baboon.

When objects come from far outside the Western tradition, there is even more
opportunity for cultural values to be placed upon them today that do not match
those of the society of origin. Picasso and the modern artists of early-twentieth-
century Paris were inspired by West African wood carvings. Those European artists
saw the carvings as the most direct of artistic expressions—because they had been
made by people in a state of nature, undistracted by the centuries of constrained
art in the academy. Yet the carvings in question were not the natural work of na-
ture’s children but were created within old and developed traditions which in their
own ways may have been as arbitrary and directing in their controlled artistic con-
ventions as were those of the French salon. At the end of the same century, in par-
allel with ancient objects which move from the earth of Third World countries to
the Western galleries and collectors go contemporary artefacts and objects, African
wood carvings still amongst them; in much the same way, their meaning changes
fundamentally as they travel long distances, both physical and cultural, from the
carver-creator to the collector-connoisseur.4

The marble ﬁgures from the Neolithic and Bronze Age of the Cyclades are 
famously revered today through their similarity (not by chance alone) with
early-twentieth-century European sculpture.5 Female depictions from prehis-
toric Europe are today often referred to as images of an ancient mother god-
dess, for reasons having more to do with turn-of-the-millennium attitudes to-
ward images of women than with secure knowledge of their meanings and roles
in ancient Europe.6 One reason that the Aboriginal “dot paintings” of the Aus-

    3

tralian central desert have become fashionable is that their graphic conventions,
deriving from indigenous traditions of body decoration, sand painting, and
rock-art, chance to coincide with the look of abstract expressionist art, a his-
torically separate affair.

There is nothing at all wrong with this. Objects routinely change in meaning
and value as they cross cultural frontiers. All of us who care for ancient things and
for ancient people can be glad they still have such a lively and a positive meaning
today. But there is a danger. Because the objects have existed in the two cultural
contexts, the modern and the ancient, it is easy to project back onto that ancient
society their modern meanings. The Cycladic marble statuettes are now routinely
called “reclining ﬁgures,”7 in echo of Henry Moore (who owned three Cycladic
ﬁgures8), yet such slight evidence as we have does not suggest they were decidedly
lying down in their ancient context.9 They were small objects routinely placed in
human graves of an illiterate society, so we can be conﬁdent they did not have the
social role then that is held by a large “Reclining Figure” which lies as a monu-
mental mass in a twentieth-century sculpture park. One also needs to realize how
straightforward the issues can be: the reason that an auction catalogue calls a Cy-
cladic ﬁgure “reclining” in its text yet illustrates it held by a metal stand in an up-
right position10 is the simple one that it sounds better described one way and looks
better illustrated the other way!

The rhetoric that now surrounds Cycladic ﬁgures and the artefacts of the Eu-
ropean Bronze Age invests these prehistoric things with anachronistic links in
deﬁning entities, such as the Greek nation-state or the uniﬁed community of Eu-
ropean nations, that had no existence in ancient times. There is no harm, and much
good, in these ancient things having such force in the modern world. There need
only be a corresponding recognition that a meaning today may or may not have
corresponded with an ancient meaning.

The other value of ancient objects, which we can call the archaeologist’s, arises
from their worth as objects conveying evidence of and from the past. This value
will  be  higher  for  those  epochs—all  of prehistory  (by  deﬁnition)  and  many
within formally historical contexts—where the other sources of information are
slight or absent. In this value, an exact correlation between ancient reality and
modern perception is the ideal aimed at, since a true understanding of the past is
the purpose. Of course, we modern researchers cannot escape from our own cul-
tural context: the words and phrases even of simple description we use are never
neutral but carry values with them, whether we choose to call a given object a
“vase” or a  “painted pot,” a  “stone statuette” or a  “reclining ﬁgure.” There is,
rightly, a wish to get behind and beyond modern values, to understand the “other,”
the meanings of objects in their own cultural places so distant from us. It should
be immaterial, for instance, if that understanding means we enjoy and respect cer-
tain objects less because we know their ancient context. The ﬁnely shaped and el-

egant obsidian blades of the ancient Mesoamericans will seem less lovely as objects
—or if more alluring, for a sinister reason—when one knows how central was
mass human sacriﬁce to Mayan society.  That emotional response is not directly
relevant to the research ambition, which is to understand Mayan society as it ac-
tually was. The opening special exhibition at the Getty Center, Los Angeles, 1997–
99, was entitled Beyond Beauty: Antiquities as Evidence, a title which in ﬁve words en-
capsulates the issues.

As long as there has been classical and archaeological scholarship, the connoisseur’s
and the archaeologist’s two interests have run together—harmoniously so for cen-
turies. But they are not coincident, and in the case of contemporary antiquities
collecting they have actually become directly opposed.

Why?
The tendency of the connoisseur’s value is to concern itself with immanent as-
pects, those contained in the object itself. It is not centrally important just where
it comes from or what its ancient meaning was. Those aspects do count in a sec-
ondary way, because a knowledge of provenance and of cultural origin informs and
enriches response to the immanent elements. That secondary aspect has other con-
sequences also. A knowledge of provenance, both of where an object came from in
the ground and of who has owned it since, gives conﬁdence the object is genuinely
ancient and not a later fabrication. And the place of cultural origin will very ma-
terially affect its cash value, in relation to judgments of relative merit and consid-
erations of supply and demand, in much the same way as applies to Impressionist
paintings, Renaissance sculpture, or any other class of desired and collected aes-
thetic object.

Some connoisseurs hold to a strongly uniformitarian view: there are universal
aesthetics which transcend the varied speciﬁcs of diverse cultures. George Ortiz
sees his collecting of ancient objects from varied cultures which he ﬁnds ﬁne and
compelling as the “pursuit of the absolute.”11 If that is so, then the acute observer
today can recover the meaning of an object by direct observation of it; the con-
noisseur’s good response will be the same as the archaeologist’s, as both capture the
original meaning, and the connoisseur’s perceptive look avoids the wearisome ar-
chaeological labour of studying intricacies in the physical context of the piece.
There is a Jungian view here of an absolute, now deeply out of sympathy with the
archaeologists and the anthropologists. If only it were so, research would be so
much easier! Those researchers, in recognizing human universals of culture and ex-
perience, ﬁnd more striking the diversity, variety, and historical particularity of so-

    5

cial meanings, especially those that surround beautiful and precious objects; we see
these as overwhelmingly relative. Since most archaeologists do not hold to a strong
and uniting view of a human consistency in these matters, we are uncomfortable
also, for instance, with the conﬁdence of some feminist ideas that the social atti-
tudes of a benign and nurturing mother goddess or of a mother-centred society
can be unambiguously discerned from the physical evidence of certain prehistoric
images of women.12

Accordingly, the tendency of the archaeologists’ value has been increasingly to
address contextual aspects, those surrounding the object. These begin with its place
in culture history (“Attic, second century ..”) and over recent decades have seen
a huge increase and elaboration in what is regarded as a sufﬁcient report of con-
text: not just ﬁndspot and likely date, but an ever more minute report of the kind
of deposit an object came from in as many aspects of its ecological and human
frame as an ingeniously self-enlarging discipline can ﬁnd to take an interest in
noticing. The immanent aspects, those contained in the object itself, remain of
central value. They are also subject to ever more ingenious study by novel methods,
as one sees in Mattusch’s work on one class of object, classical cast bronzes.13
These minute explorations of the ﬁne physical object itself are a long-declining
portion of that overall body of information which archaeologists now work with
and value.

For the same reason, the old museum collections are of decisively decreasing
research value.  Take the prehistoric axe, identiﬁable as Neolithic by its distinctive
immanent characteristics, about which we know only that it came from (or is said
to have come from) “Port Stewart, County Antrim, Ireland,” in the Cambridge
University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (accession 1923.1082 I). Its
beauty—and the present authors do ﬁnd Neolithic polished axes beautiful—does
not change. Yet this lovely object is of ever less scholarly value as our ignorance of
its context means it can contribute ever less to the very lively research concerns we
continue to have for Neolithic axes in the British Isles.14 To take another class of
artefact, there are hand-axes by the hundred and the thousand in the older mu-
seum  collections  of Old World  lithics;  but  as  vaguely  provenanced  individual 
ﬁnds (“Thames gravels, Maidenhead”; “Nile terraces”) from redeposited contexts,
they offer slight information by comparison with the comparatively few hand-axes
that have been excavated archaeologically to modern standards from the compar-
atively few hand-axe sites where good and primary contexts exist (e.g., Boxgrove, 
England15). However diligently one studies the hand-axes in the old collections
through the information immanent in the objects (e.g., the complex variability of
their size and shape), the lack of recorded context has been, ﬁrst, a grave and, in-
creasingly now, a fatal obstacle to productive study of them.16

If one goes back a century, one ﬁnds that the reporting of context was much
the  same  for  objects  in  the  connoisseur’s  and  in  the  archaeologist’s  worlds:  a

6    .

ﬁndspot in broad terms (“north Essex,” “Mycenae”), an inferred or likely date
(“Neolithic,” “Early Helladic”), and perhaps the summary context, that is con-
veyed in a few words (“in a grave,” “from a temple foundation deposit”). That kind
of report remains routine in the connoisseur’s tradition but has become inadequate
more nearly to the point of uselessness for contemporary archaeological research.
It has the largest consequences for the kind of knowledge of ancient places and
peoples which is then possible. It explains the ever declining value of the old col-
lections for modern research, a declining value that shows itself in many ways. A
recent demonstration of this is in the choice of twelve carvings placed in the new
Great Court project of the British Museum to introduce the cultures represented
in the galleries beyond.17 Of the twelve, three are of unknown and one of uncer-
tain ﬁndspot; for the remaining eight for which a ﬁndspot is known, our knowl-
edge of the archaeological context is inadequate by modern standards of scholar-
ship. The marble lion from Knidos in Asia Minor is a good instance. We know
exactly where it comes from, and even the trackway still exists that was made from
its ﬁndspot in the ruins of a great tomb down to the water’s edge so its several
tonnes of weight could be moved away. But we know so little about the archaeol-
ogy of the lion that even the basic information of its date—probably late fourth
or early third century ..—derives from ﬁrsthand knowledge not of this lion, but
of a similar one elsewhere with a better historical and archaeological context.

We see this divergence over time between the interests and the methods of the
two values, and of the communities that hold those values, as the main motor for
the increasing division between the archaeologists and the connoisseurs; their in-
terests, which for so long have been identical or close, are becoming increasingly
opposed. Unprovenanced antiquities have always surfaced; both the connoisseurs
and the archaeologists have taken an interest in them and learned from them. 
But we are now at a point where the connoisseurs—though regretting the lack of
provenance and context which would enrich by a secondary knowledge their cen-
tral and immanent value—still enjoy these objects as good and wonderful ancient
things, while the archaeologists increasingly ﬁnd them void of information and
useless. Worse, every object that leaves the ground without an exacting record, and
so has lost a quantum of information in the missing account of context, the ar-
chaeologist sees as a theft of that potential knowledge which has been stolen and
scattered away.

So we see the two values as necessarily tending to separation and to opposi-
tion, on these deﬁning and fundamental grounds. Other divergences also have a di-
visive effect—the connoisseur’s impulse to restore ﬁne things towards their origi-
nal glory against the archaeologist’s to leave things as time and chance have treated
them, the national and other interests which hold such decided and divided views
as to who legitimately owns the past of any one place, and the ﬁnancial conse-
quences of buying and selling antiquities. The surfacing of an object outside its re-

    7

gion of origin and its possession in an overseas jurisdiction have become offences
against the nation-states whose people partly deﬁne themselves and their nation-
hood by a cultural patrimony of material objects.

There is an important aysmmetry here. Expression of the archaeological con-
cern for knowledge of the ancient object in its own time and cultural context does
nothing to obstruct the connoisseur’s concern. When the sculptor Henry Moore
reported his reactions to ancient objects in the British Museum collection in an 
excellent book,18 he gave a range of responses. Some are consistent with what we
know about their ancient contexts, while some are not; many address aspects about
which we have little information. That artist’s or connoisseur’s response, based in
the modern world, is in no way obstructed by the archaeological concern with the
objects’ ancient meanings. That is not the case when pursuit of the connoisseur’s
interest leads to the loss of knowledge of the original context; when that happens,
the connoisseur’s concern destroys the possibility of a productive archaeological
interest.

Those other issues have been addressed many times and in many places. We
have chosen to concentrate on the central divergence, between the immanence of
the object and the context of the object, as deﬁned above and as expressed in the
attitudes to objects of these two traditions of approach to ancient things.

Two of us recognized—much less clearly—this distinction between the con-
noisseur’s and the archaeologist’s distinct concerns in a study of the Cycladic
ﬁgures,19 one of the ﬁrst to address these issues. Cycladic ﬁgures were selected be-
cause there was a clearly deﬁned corpus, and because most or nearly all or all seem
to have been made and originally deposited in a small band of islands, the Cy-
clades, in the southern Aegean during the third millennium ..20 On the one hand,
as archaeologists we could read reports of looted cemeteries in the Cyclades, and
on  the  other,  we  could  observe  Cycladic  ﬁgures  “surfacing” in  a  routine  way
through the antiquities market.

The wholesale looting of cemeteries to provide collectors with a particular
type of artefact means that some information is irretrievably lost. Not only have
90 percent of the contexts been lost, but we have to use the few contexts recorded
for the remaining 10 percent to answer questions about the types of context where
such ﬁgures were displayed, used, and buried. Most come, or are thought to have
come, from the graves. Keros had a deposit of a different character, the “Keros
hoard,” a major deposit of fragmentary ﬁgures which ended up in a Swiss private
collection.21 So we have an enigma, rather than any kind of certain record, when we
wish to develop our knowledge of some nonfunerary or other religious use for

8    .

such ﬁgures. There are a few large ﬁgures, whose larger size leads some to argue
they  were  used  as  cult  statues;  but  we  have  no  context  for  them  by  which  to
conﬁrm or deny the theories. Even attempts to group the ﬁgures stylistically, and
to attribute them to speciﬁc islands or to the hands of individual artisans, must
surely founder when only 10 percent of the ﬁgures come from secure archaeologi-
cal contexts. It is impossible to make a credible distribution study of the ﬁgures
when some 90 percent have either no stated ﬁndspot or a ﬁndspot which is re-
ported in some indirect way. (It will be some variant of “said to be,” perhaps said
by the man wearing the suit in that smart gallery who said that the man who sold
it to him in the suburbs of Munich said that the driver who brought it in from
Greece said that the man whom he brought it for said that he had been told that
it had been dug up on the island of Paros. . . . But there again, one of these gen-
tlemen may have misheard.22)

The context is lost, however, not just for the Cycladic ﬁgures themselves which
we were studying. The bones, the broken small fragments, and the other stuff with-
out art-market value are wholly lost; knowledge of associations between artefacts
which are not discarded may be lost. The same gloomy picture, perhaps even worse,
might  well  emerge  from  a  parallel  study  for  other  classes  of Early  Cycladic 
objects—the marble vessels, or ceramic decorated  “frying pans.” Even a well-
documented Cycladic collection in a university museum like the Fitzwilliam Mu-
seum in Cambridge only has material with loose ﬁndspots and inadequate record
of context.23 Those items were acquired at the turn of the twentieth century when
Cambridge men were exploring the Greek islands. Again we see that the present-
day connoisseur’s attitude—“context is a bonus when known but neither central
nor essential”—coincides with archaeological attitudes of three or four genera-
tions ago, but it is at odds with all rules of archaeological ﬁeld research today.

It is for these reasons that a fundamental opposition is now apparent between
these interests. We see no reason why a fundamental opposition must persist, for
there are several strong causes for the connoisseur’s interest to beneﬁt from the ar-
chaeological, which we see as having more to offer to the connoisseur’s actual best
interest than does the immediate promise of more access to ﬁne antiquities for
sale.

It was suggested to us that the pattern emerging from Cycladic was not typical for
classical antiquity.24 The limited area of the Cyclades and the desirability of these
Cycladic ﬁgures has meant—so it was put to us—that our study would present
a gloomier picture than would be true for a wider range of classical antiquity with

    9

its marble sculptures, painted pottery, and small bronzes. As Eisenberg, a knowl-
edgeable dealer and museum benefactor, explained to us, Cycladic is a famous mess,
so much so that sensible dealers steer clear of it.

Our Cycladic study is semiquantitative and conﬁned to one class of antiqui-
ties alone. There, pursuit of these lovely things has had calamitous material and in-
tellectual consequences. Is this a uniquely unhappy state of affairs? Or sadly typi-
cal? Or something in between?

So, going forward from that ﬁrst study of the Cycladic ﬁgures, we have turned
our attention to the broader spectrum of classical antiquity. Speciﬁcally, we de-
cided to look at the spate of major exhibitions, largely drawn from the collections
of private individuals, which were a feature of the classical scene through the 1990s;
this makes the second study.25

Because those collections drew on the antiquities market, it is important to
gain a sense of the pattern in that market: that is the third study,26 an exploration
of what is offered in the leading London auction rooms. Extending back some
decades, this study begins to offer a historical perspective, in beginning to show the
antiquities market has changed in its proﬁle since World War II.

Private ownership of antiquities is itself part of a larger pattern, in which the
other element is the public ownership of antiquities in the museum collections.
The long-established museum collections also offer a picture of collecting over a
yet longer time scale, extending to the centuries since the Renaissance interest in
classical artefacts prompted the collecting habits of the modern world. The fourth
study27 reports on accessions to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford—the oldest
public museum in Britain—over three centuries, giving a ﬁrst report of the longer-
term pattern of collecting into public ownership.

In studying objects from private collections, the key issue that divides the corpus
is provenance: for some material we have no knowledge beyond the immanent (be-
cause it has “no provenance”) and for other material we have knowledge of con-
text (because there is provenance).

Provenance (also spelled  “provenience”) has several meanings. We think it
valuable to clarify those, and to suggest distinct terms for two central aspects. Since
provenance often adds to an object’s value, these are not matters wholly of neutral
judgement. Provenance, deﬁned in the dictionary as  “the fact of coming from
some particular source or quarter,” is actually becoming a diversity of information,
rather than a simple fact. The “particular source or quarter” may be an item’s hav-

ing been found at a site of classical antiquity, or its having been in an auction sale
of less than a decade ago, or a report of who owned it at one time in between its
ﬁnding and the present. The main discriminant is the different moment in time at
which the fact of having a certain source is noticed and thereafter seems pertinent.
So we need to consider the entire life story of an object now esteemed a ﬁne and
ancient thing in a museum or private collection, the successive stages of events it
has experienced, and the changing concerns which directed interest in it at succes-
sive stages.

A deﬁned object has some starting place of origin where it was made, which
begins its story. The ﬁrst part of the story is its life in the ancient world, its mak-
ing and subsequent transport, use, transformation, reuse, repair, remaking, and so
on until the moment when it went out of human circulation by being swallowed
into the ground. Since all this is a matter for archaeological study, and that place
in the ground is its archaeological context, we can call this ancient story the ar-
chaeology of the  object.28 The  information  that  the  object  thenceforth  conveys 
resides in the object itself and in the information conveyed by its sedimentary con-
text and associations. The object then stays in a limbo until such time as it is re-
moved; by its nature and archaeological context, just what it is and in just what
stratigraphic place it holds in just what deposit at just what location, it has the po-
tential to inform its ﬁnders about its archaeological story and therefore about the
ancient society which made and used it.

At some long-subsequent date, the object was come across, recovered from
the ground, and reentered human society in a new career as an archaeological and
art object; since this modern story is, or could be, a matter of documented his-
torical record, we can call this the history of the object. For some objects we have
a complete historical record that links where it is found to its present whereabouts
through a documented history of its successive owners, especially for objects
which have been in a single museum over a long term. For other objects the his-
torical record is incomplete (when its ownership is known for part of the time
and is then unknown until it “surfaces” later on) or missing (when we think or
know it was dug up decades or centuries ago, but we do not know where it has
been since then).

The moment of discovery and recovery is the time when the object leaves the
archaeological domain in the ground and is taken away to start its historical career.
There should be good knowledge of this key moment, knowledge which links the
archaeology of the object to the history of the object. Instead of a link, there is
too often a break. When there is poor knowledge of the moment—as is the case
for many objects recovered in the pioneering days of systematic excavation or as
chance ﬁnds—our ability to learn from its archaeology is reduced.  When there
is no knowledge—as is the case for those objects which surface without record—
our ability to learn from its archaeology is reduced fatally to zero.

Our knowledge of this key moment which starts its history equally varies

from the good through the poor to zero.

The literature about antiquities—whether in the academic publications or the
newspapers—is full of compelling individual stories. Partisan opinions are sup-
ported by vivid accounts of telling case studies, and by the decided views that in-
dividuals have come to after years of experience.

An informed debate about the issue of looted antiquities needs to go beyond
that documented and often anecdotal evidence for looting to some ﬁgures which
demonstrate the level and impact of looting. It is the actual numbers which will in-
dicate the truth of the matter. Some of the questions that will elicit key numbers
will be:

How many of some given class of objects were there in ancient times?

How many survived in the ground as archaeological objects?

How many have been recovered?

Where are the ones recovered?

How much do we know about them?

At what rate are they at the present being removed from the ground with
record?

At what rate are they at the present being removed from the ground 
without record?

Some objects have always been and will always be rare or unique—for example, the
Parthenon sculptures, or individual pharaonic burials. Some existed in the many
thousands or hundreds of thousands, even millions, such as the rolled hand-axes
ubiquitous in Pleistocene river gravels across the Old World, the Egyptian shabti
ﬁgures, or the amphorae used to transport liquids in the classical world. Some
classes of ancient objects are known to exist in several hundred or a few thousand
examples, among them the kouros ﬁgures, large Hellenistic bronzes, and the Cycladic
ﬁgures.

The numbers are crucial since they decide how much there has been and how
much there is, how much there was, how much has been lost. This approach can

lections? Or are they for the most part new ﬁnds, irregularly recovered and illic-
itly exported from their countries of origin?

A quantitative account would inform us what is happening at the present and
how that relates to what has happened in the past. Those uncertainties of the pres-
ent equally apply to the past. We think we know, overall, the pattern of collecting
of antiquities by private individuals and by public museums over the centuries—
in a qualitative way. But again, we do not know actual numbers. Where are the
quantitative histories that would tell us just how many antiquities and of what
classes left Egypt in the eighteenth century, or Greece in the nineteenth? Without
some grasp of how many antiquities there were, and how many moved about when,
it is impossible to assess the scale of what is happening nowadays in relation to the
whole pattern.29

We have been making the ﬁrst steps to quantitative study in the four individual ex-
plorations. We report these four in summary form, and on the basis of that expe-
rience indicate what a quantitative approach appears to us to promise.

It has been estimated that the surviving corpus for Cycladic ﬁgures represents some
1,600 pieces, whether fragmentary or complete. These ﬁgures have emerged in the
following ways: through archaeological excavation, through chance ﬁnds, through
illicit excavation, through the antiquities market, and from old collections. Our
study has suggested that only about 140 ﬁgures were recovered archaeologically; the
remaining 1,400 or so ﬁgures have surfaced on the antiquities market without ex-
planation.31 So less than 10 percent of the corpus of known ﬁgures comes with any
sort of archaeological context. To put it another way, more than 90 percent of the
ﬁgures have no archaeological context.

Within our study was an examination of the major 1987 exhibition, Cycladic
Art  in  North  American  Collections,32 which  was  drawn  from  both  private 
and public collections. The ninety-two ﬁgures in the exhibition provided these
statistics:

Certain provenance:

“Said to be”:

No origin:

0

Our quantitative study was able to provide more detail. If the 1500—1600 ﬁgures
or so in the corpus are indeed genuine—and Cycladic ﬁgures are notoriously easy

    13

to fake—then it would be possible to estimate how many graves had been looted
to provide the corpus. From excavated cemeteries, we know that Cycladic ﬁgures
tend to be found in about every tenth grave. If we exclude the 350 ﬁgures associ-
ated with the Keros hoard, some 1,150 ﬁgures have no known ﬁndspot; we think—
without actually knowing—that these came from graves. Thus if the excavated
10 percent of the ﬁgures come from representative cemeteries, and that must
surely be a big “if,” then the remaining 1,150 ﬁgures represent some 12,000 graves
looted. As most Early Cycladic cemeteries consist of 15– 20 graves, we are talk-
ing about several hundred looted cemeteries destroyed forever by this scale of
looting: 85 percent of that funerary record in the Cyclades may have been de-
stroyed through looting in order to provide beautiful objects for collectors and
museums.

We concluded, in this 1993 study, that the destruction of the Cycladic archae-
ological contexts had been on such a scale that the materials likely no longer ex-
isted by which research could make a decisively different and improved account of
the ancient Cyclades, as one would hope improved scholarship over future decades
and centuries would do. A few years on now, research in the Cyclades continues, of
course, but we see nothing to change our 1993 opinion.

The second quantitative history considers seven exhibitions of antiquities which
were displayed in Europe, North America, and Israel through the 1990s. Many of
these were exclusively drawn from private collections or incorporated private ma-
terial. They were high-proﬁle exhibitions with illustrated catalogues at prestige
venues, three of private collections alone, three combining private with museum
collections, one of a museum collection largely originating in a recent private col-
lection. This study has tabulated nearly 1,400 ﬁne antiquities, of which over 850
were in the new private collections. The seven exhibitions are:

Private collections exhibited
1. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1990– 91, Glories of the
Past: Ancient Art from the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection.34
2. At the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Cleveland Museum of Art,
1994– 95, A Passion for Antiquities: Ancient Art from the Collection of
Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman.35
3. At the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, the State Pushkin
Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, and the Royal Academy, London, 1993– 94,
In Pursuit of the Absolute: Art of the Ancient World from the George
Ortiz Collection.36

5. At the Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge, England, 1992,

6. At the Arthur M. Sackler Art Museum, Harvard University Art

7. The San Antonio Museum of Art permanent collection of ancient

Our study concentrated on the key aspects: when the object ﬁrst surfaced,
what details of the ﬁndspot were provided, and what account was given of the ob-
ject by way of its provenance, that is, its archaeology and its history. Intending to
think clearly about what kinds of information about provenance are offered, we
devised these classes within archaeology and history.

7.2.1 Archaeology of the Contemporary Classical Collections
For archaeology, that is, the information known about the object until it left the
ground in modern times, we classiﬁed the objects into six groups, from those for
which fullest information was offered, to those for which there is least:

a1 Named ﬁndspot, or “almost certainly” therefrom
a2 “Said to be” or “allegedly” from a named ﬁndspot
a3 “Probably” from a named ﬁndspot
a4 “Possibly” or “perhaps” from a named ﬁndspot
a5 Unknown or unstated
a6 Stated in some terms, but the source of that appears to be afﬁnity: it has
been deduced from diagnostic characteristics observed in the object itself,
rather than supplied by independent information.

Notice  that  class  a1—the  class  with  the  best  archaeological  information—is
satisﬁed by an account of the archaeology in the simplest terms of a named place
as ﬁndspot, a place which may be a large town or even a region; that information
falls short of a satisfactory archaeological account of context.

Table 1 reports the status of archaeology for the items, divided by exhibition,
and between the public and private collections. Seventy-four percent of the objects
have no indication of archaeology beyond what is inferred from their immanent

characteristics. Twenty-six percent have some indication, but more than half of
these are qualiﬁed in such terms as  “said to be from” or other indications of
doubt. Eleven percent have stated ﬁndspots, but that number, about one object in
nine, we are cautious of. Firstly, the indication of ﬁndspot is often very vague—
a country or region, rather than a certain deposit in a speciﬁc archaeological site—
and so the “ﬁndspot” is an archaeological account of only slight research value.
Secondly, as we look with care at just what is said in the catalogues and as we see
the history of individual objects, we are increasingly fearful that many of those
statements printed in terms of “found in X” (our category a1), as if an indepen-
dent record, are in truth deduced from diagnostic characteristics (our category a6).
We conjecture that a surfacing object is identiﬁed as, say, Minoan (our a6), and
that this inferred attribution is at some later stage or by another party reported in
different terms as “ﬁndspot Crete” (our a1), since Crete is where one would ex-
pect a Minoan object to be found. So we are not certain the conﬁdently reported
ﬁndspots actually are always the ﬁndspots, and an unknown (high?) proportion of
the “most secure” archaeological accounts in fact will rightly belong in the “least
secure” group! Dismayingly, then, we do not reliably know whether we indeed
know what we think we know about the archaeology of the items.

The pattern is not much different between the museum and the private col-

lections.

7.2.2 History of the Contemporary Classical Collections
For  history,  that  is,  the  information  known  about  the  object  since  it  left  the
ground in modern times, we classiﬁed the objects into six groups, from that for
which the longest history was offered to those for which there is the shortest or no
history at all before the object “surfaced” in the exhibition or collection:

h1 An account is given since it was found and left the ground
h2 Known at a date up to 1914
h3 Known in the period 1915– 44
h4 Known in the period 1945– 73
h5 Known in the period 1974– 86
h6 Known in the period from 1987 onward
h7 Surfaced on this occasion
h8 Date of surfacing not known to us
h9 Date of surfacing uncertain

Table 2 reports the status of history for the items, divided by exhibition, and
between the public and private collections. Some 9 percent, or one item in eleven,
have a history from the ground or are known before 1945. If one regards a history
going back to before 1945 as meaning the object is from “an old collection,” then
it is not the case that these new classical collections of the 1980s and 1990s are

demonstrably recycled from those old collections. Some 38 percent surfaced on the
occasion of the exhibitions (but for private collections the ﬁgure is 60 percent). We
have divided the postwar years into three groups; if one takes 1973, the year the Ar-
chaeological Institute of America declared its change of publication policy,41 as a
key date, then 74 percent of these objects surfaced subsequent to that shift. We no-
tice that the 23 percent surfacing before then are not all “clean,” for that change of
AIA policy, and the other shifts in attitude, happened in response to the open
scandal of unprovenanced antiquities surfacing in the years before 1973.

We conclude that the pattern across high-proﬁle classical collecting, as evident
in these exhibitions and as legitimated by their display in the best museums (and
by the acquisition of one of these collections by the Getty), is that a very high pro-
portion of these items do surface without archaeological context or record of his-
tory. We think Eisenberg may well be right in thinking that Cycladic ﬁgures are a
notable mess, but we see that classical collecting as a whole is a mess. Without a 
reanalysis of the Cycladic ﬁgures using categories more closely comparable with
those used for the classical collections, we cannot say which mess is worse.

London has been one of the main centres for the redistribution of antiquities in
this  century  through  the  activity  of the  major  auction  houses  of Sotheby’s,
Christie’s, Bonham’s, and Phillip’s. Subsequent to the exposé in Peter Watson’s
book Sotheby’s: Inside Story,43 Sotheby’s closed down their antiquities operations in
London; antiquities continue to be auctioned at Sotheby’s in New York and at the
other London houses. The new virtual auction houses on the Internet, where
Sotheby’s has a presence, are giving antiquities some prominence.

This recent study has made a ﬁrst quantitative sketch of the London auction
market in antiquities since World War II,44 as it is documented by the printed cat-
alogues. The illustrated catalogues of the auction rooms provide a public record of
what passed through them, not matched by any equivalent sources for what moved
through the dealers. Catalogues of the two larger houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s,
were sampled at ten-year intervals over a forty-year period, from 1958 to 1998.45Ten
catalogues from each of the two auction houses were sampled, with some 2,051 lots
tabulated. Approximately one-quarter of the objects are Egyptian.

The tabulations focused on three aspects of information which appeared in
the catalogues. The ﬁrst aspect is the vendor. This ranges from the wholly anony-
mous, through the thoroughly vague such as “property of a lady,” to the very vague
(“property of a Belgian gentleman”), to the speciﬁc, naming the selling individ-
ual or institution.

The second aspect is the archaeology of the piece. This ranges from a named
ﬁndspot, through a ﬁndspot qualiﬁed with some element of doubt, to unstated or

    19

what  we  have  considered  to  be  the  afﬁnity,  in  other  words,  the  deduction  of
ﬁndspot from distinctive features of the object itself. These can be classed by es-
sentially the same categories as for the classical collections study (above).

The third aspect is the history of the piece. This ranges from knowledge of
the piece since it left the ground, through to the object surfacing for the ﬁrst time
at the auction. The categories used for the classical study (above) cannot be used
usefully here, since the auction-house study itself spans a long period of time, but
equivalent classes can be made in terms of how long a history of the piece is 
offered.

What did these studies show?
Unstated vendors seem to be the norm for the sales, with unnamed Belgian
as well as Swiss gentlemen high in the league. At both Sotheby’s and Christie’s, 81
percent of objects are offered by unnamed vendors. Only a few sales have a high
percentage of named vendors, generally when a collection of a named individual is
dispersed in a block of lots making a large portion of a single sale. The Christie’s
auction of June 1978 returns a ﬁgure of 65 percent of objects with a named vendor,
as many come from “the collection of the late Joseph Muller of Solothurn, Switzer-
land”; the Swiss connection is perhaps ironic.

The archaeology of the objects provides a decisive picture: 96 percent of the
objects auctioned at Sotheby’s and 95 percent of those at Christie’s have no indi-
cation of ﬁndspot whatsoever, so the level of archaeological account is decisively
less than it is for the classical collections. The picture emerging for the history of
the objects is also clear, with Sotheby’s and Christie’s auctioning 88 percent and
89 percent respectively of their objects without historical information. So just
under 90 percent of objects offered for auction in the survey since World War II
ﬁrst “surfaced” in the sale itself. Only 2 percent of objects from Christie’s and 1
percent from Sotheby’s appear with a history which could be traced back to the
ground. The historical information is very patchy in its occurrence: the 10 percent
or so of items with history largely derive from occasions when a named collection
is dispersed as a grouped set of lots.

With so little information offered as to either archaeology or history, there are
no strong long-term trends to be identiﬁed in the forty-year time span of the
study. Silence is the consistent rule. This really is surprising, since it is so much a
convention of collecting that objects with provenance are worth more than those
without, and those with a provenance considered good are worth even more. An
Old Master painting with ideal provenance—known to have been made in the
artist’s  studio  at  a  certain  date  and  with  a  recorded  sequence  of owners  ever
since—has its archaeological equivalent in the object with a full account both in
archaeological terms (where it was excavated) and in historical terms (subsequent
movements). It is noticeable that in recent decades there has been some increase
in the amount of historical information provided in the sales catalogues.

We conclude that there is decisively less declared about the archaeology and
history of objects on the London auction market than is the case for our classical
collections, and that the London market’s habits in these matters have not changed
much over the postwar decades. One explanation of the difference would be that
information is conveyed to auction-room purchasers through means other than the
auction catalogues. Another would be that objects acquired by collectors through
other routes or intermediaries bring with them more information. This also may
shed light on our fear that the declared ﬁndspots are not independently known but
inferred (as discussed earlier); since the pattern of auction reticence is much the
same for archaeology as for history (and as for vendor), there may be grounds for
some cautious conﬁdence that the collectors’ reports of ﬁndspot are indeed inde-
pendent records which may be relied on.

All these movements inside and outside the twentieth-century market take place
against the background of longer-term patterns, those that over the centuries move
cultural objects within nation-states and across the world. Our fourth study is a pi-
oneering attempt at a quantitative history of museum collections. A full quanti-
tative history of Western collecting is a labour of centuries, so we start with a sin-
gle museum and even then ﬁnd the number of objects sufﬁciently large that we are
obliged to deal only with a small sample taken from it.

The holdings of Greek and Roman antiquities in the Ashmolean Museum,
Oxford University, represent some 300 years of collecting,47 presenting a body of
data for the study of trends over that time span. The founding gift of the Trades-
cant Collection was accepted by Oxford in 1683, when a building was found to
house the material. During the 1860s, no doubt mirroring the 1850 gift of the 
Museum  Disneianum to  Cambridge  (where  it  was  displayed  in  the  Fitzwilliam 
Museum),48 the Ashmolean acquired a number of classical antiquities, including
material  from  the  Christy  and  Hyde  Clarke  collections.  Its  early  antiquarian 
approach was transformed in 1884 when Oxford established a chair of classical 
archaeology; this led to the move of the museum to its present location on Beau-
mont Street.

The documentation for the Ashmolean is preserved in a series of accession
registers and catalogues. An accessions register in the modern sense has been kept
since 1869, and the subsequent 130 years record in excess of 95,000 entries. A sam-
pling system was adopted which selected six blocks of 10 years, and the ﬁrst 50 clas-
sical entries of each year were tabulated (though not every year had 50 antiquities
accessioned). To bring the study up to date, further material from 1988– 89 to
1998– 99 was also considered.

The collection was quantiﬁed in terms of object type (for example, ceramics,

    21

sculpture, or jewellery), of archaeological provenance, of previous history, and of
accession route (for example, from an excavation, by gift or by purchase).

The largest category of accession in the sampled periods was for ceramics, fol-
lowed a long way behind by sculpture. In the earliest sample, from the 1870s, ce-
ramics represented 58 percent of the accessions, compared to 8 percent for sculp-
ture; ceramics rose to its highest point of 82 percent during the 1930s, compared to
14 percent for sculpture. This can be explained generally by the survival of pottery,
especially in graves, but also by a local factor, the speciﬁc interest at Oxford in
Greek painted pottery, notably by Sir John Beazley. In some ways this is a similar
pattern to that found at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, where from 1920
to 1960, under the keepership of Winifred Lamb, few additions of sculpture were
made to the already substantial holdings of the John Disney and E.D. Clarke col-
lections, whereas representative pottery was added as fascicules of the Corpus Va-
sorum Antiquorum were being prepared.49 Both the Ashmolean and the Fitzwilliam
acquired representative selections of shard material from British excavations in
Greece.

Initially a large number of Ashmolean acquisitions were acquired with some
indication of archaeological provenance. This can be explained by the activities of
the Reverend Greville Chester or the keepers John Phillips and Arthur Evans in the
Mediterranean. There was a noticeable fall in this percentage during the 1920s and
1930s, when a greater emphasis was placed on acquiring objects through purchase,
often in the main auction houses in London. It is likely that an emphasis was
placed on the suitability of an object to ﬁll perceived gaps in the Ashmolean’s ex-
isting holdings, a policy which was explicitly stated at the Fitzwilliam. From the
1950s onward there has been a gradual increase in the proportion of acquisitions
which display some indication of the archaeology.

The distribution of objects with prior history is telling. For the 1870s and
1880s, 44 percent and 58 percent of the objects had a prior history, reﬂecting the
collecting of Chester, Phillips, or Evans. This fell to a low of 7 percent and 5 per-
cent during the 1920s and 1930s, when many objects were being bought on the an-
tiquities market. Since then there has been a steady increase in the acquisition of
objects which have a certain prior history.

The accession route also shows plain trends, notably the gradual increase of
objects from excavations connected with the Ashmolean or Oxford. Gifts or be-
quests, often by former members of Oxford, have also been a signiﬁcant group.
Purchases became increasingly important through the 1920s and 1930s, reaching a
high of 62 percent; this has subsequently fallen back to 22 percent.

These parallel trends at the Ashmolean reﬂect a changing relationship of the
museum and the market. Initially, the museum almost always acquired directly
from those pursuing classical studies in classical lands; indeed, at the start there
was no antiquities market as such from which to acquire. Around the turn of the

22    .

nineteenth to the twentieth century, that means of acquisition led to a greatly in-
creased number of accessions, as systematic excavation generated so many ﬁnds.
The mid-twentieth century saw a turning to the marketplace, and the late twen-
tieth century saw a withdrawal as the concerns of the market and of the museums
were seen to diverge. With a reluctance to draw on the market, with much higher
antiquities prices, and with national policies that antiquities should not leave their
countries of ﬁndspot, the major routes by which classical antiquities have come
to the Ashmolean are variously blocked; the most striking feature of the closing
years of the twentieth century was the small quantity of new classical acquisi-
tions.

To our knowledge, the Ashmolean study is—like the other quantitative stud-
ies collectively reported here—unprecedented. We cannot know if the Ashmolean
story is typical until comparable studies have been made of other collections, so
that a pan-British, pan-European, or pan-United States pattern can be seen and re-
ported. Every museum collection, like every private collection, has idiosyncratic el-
ements, with the Ashmolean collections strongly showing the consequences of par-
ticular individuals, such as Evans and Beazley, and of the particular course that
classical archaeology has taken at Oxford. Alongside those local factors, we think
we may begin to discern in the Ashmolean story aspects which would be paralleled
in other collections. But until more quantitative history is done, we cannot address
the large questions: How many and what kind of classical antiquities left Italy and
Greece during the pre-Napoleonic era of the Grand Tour? During the nineteenth-
century era of cultural tourism? What has been the volume and nature of antiq-
uities leaving Egypt during the many centuries its ancient cultures fascinated Eu-
ropean society?

The central issue is one of numbers. Are the objects in present times being ex-
tracted from archaeological sites and surfacing without record of their archaeology
and history a small or even an inconsequential proportion of what has survived
from ancient times to the present, so no great harm follows? Are they a large or
an overwhelming proportion, to the point that productive new understanding of
these ancient objects and of the societies they record has become or will shortly
become impossible? That gloomy view is certainly the case for the societies which
made the Cycladic ﬁgures.50 Trendall’s standard handbook on South Italian Red
Figure reported in 1989: “There are at present something approaching 20,000 red-
ﬁgured vases from South Italy and Sicily, of which about 1500 may be classed as
Lucanian, over 10,000 as Apulian, some 4000 as Campanian, 2000 as Paestan and

    23

over 1000 as Sicilian.”51 For how many of those 20,000 do we have knowledge of
context, alongside that evidence which is immanent in them? How many vases were
originally placed in the southern Italian ground? How many are still in the ground?
How rapidly are those being removed? Where are they going? For how many is
there record of context? And in what degree and detail of record? We have few
quantitative studies so far; the four reported here are the only ones we are aware
of which address the issues in these terms, when taken with those on Apulian
painted pottery and on Belizean antiquities, presented at the 1999 Cambridge con-
ference.52 For many classes of material, the evidence may in fact exist and be re-
ported in scattered places, from which some collated picture could be put together.
According to one study, there are now almost as many Apulian pots in North
America as there are in the museums of Italy, a movement which can largely be ex-
plained through the deliberate ransacking of Italian cemeteries to obtain this cat-
egory of material.53

How does one know if a resource is being exhausted? If—like the individu-
als that amount to the population of an endangered species—there exists a certain
and limited number, then one sign of a nearing end may be a diminution in the
number killed or seen. If, for instance, the number of newly surfacing South Ital-
ian Red Figure vases has been decidedly dwindling, that could be because the re-
source is being worked out. (The analogy with endangered species is imperfect
here: living animals reproduce and inanimate vases do not.) Or it could be that the
pressure to exploit has lessened. Or there is a more complex story: perhaps the sup-
ply of Red Figure vases from the common known contexts is being exhausted, but
there remains a large population in other contexts, of which we are less aware or
unaware. Perhaps the vases called Apulian are no longer coming from Apulia but
from some other region the scholars have not been sufﬁciently alert to. (One can
compare the coelacanth, the ancient ﬁsh genus threatened in its known habitat off
Madagascar but recently reported to exist also as a separate population in In-
donesian waters, far away across the Indian Ocean.) As more quantitative studies
are done, we may know better what the populations of antiquities are in their many
varieties of genus and species, and we may begin to recognize some patterns in what
happens to those populations over time. In the case of the Cycladic ﬁgures, for ex-
ample, we have a slow growth in the rate of “capture,” for these human images were
in the nineteenth century regarded more as barbarous than desirable. Capture
reached a high level in the decades after World War II, in response to their evoca-
tion of modernist sculpture, when the illicit excavation of cemeteries in quest of
the ﬁgures seems to have reached some kind of peak. Will the rate at which ﬁgures
surface correspondingly decline? Has it already? If it has not or it does not, whence
come the ﬁgures still being seen for the ﬁrst time? From accumulated caches built
up in the years of busy looting? From a body of ﬁgures which went into now-old
European collections, late in the nineteenth and early in the twentieth centuries,

24    .

despite the marginal aesthetic standing of Cycladic art during those decades? Or
from new manufacture, since no reliable means exist to identify a marble ﬁgure as
modern, and the identiﬁcation of fakes depends on stylistic assessment alone?

 

The archaeological interest laments the loss of knowledge which it sees to follow
from the kind of classical collecting reported in this paper.

How great is that loss?
In respect of Cycladic ﬁgures, we have the numbers to know. About 90 percent
of the corpus is without archaeology and nearly without history. The ﬁgures are
diverse, varying in many ways, and largely occur in a limited region, the Cycladic
Islands, and a limited archaeological context, the cemeteries; the cemeteries have
for the most part been destroyed through looting. Some ﬁgures occur in quite dif-
ferent contexts; what kind of site the “Keros hoard” came from remains uncertain,
but it clearly was not a cemetery like the others, and it had hundreds of ﬁgures. It
is clear that a 10 percent sample cannot give even a reliable sketch of the range of
Cycladic ﬁgures as regards their own characteristics, their range in space, and their
range in time. Because it seems likely that a great majority of the places where they
are found have now been destroyed—a few by archaeological enquiry with some
record, many by illicit looting without record—our potential understanding of
Cycladic culture, a culture of truly singular character, is much reduced, not just
now but, it seems, in perpetuity.54 By deﬁnition, because we have lost it we do not
know what it is that we have lost.

In respect of some other kinds of ancient objects and cultures, we again may
have sufﬁcient grounds to estimate how much there once was. The Minoan civ-
ilization is largely conﬁned to the island of Crete, and the key buildings within 
Minoan culture were its palaces, of which the most famous is Knossos.55 Because
these great Minoan sites seem to be distributed across the island, each in its own
territory, it is likely that the small number we are aware of is all, or nearly all,
there are.

It is certainly true that archaeology, in its energetic development in the nine-
teenth and twentieth centuries, has had too little regard for the rate at which it has
consumed. Cycladic and Minoan cultures are unusual in that we may be able to
make a reasonably accurate estimate as to just how much has been consumed and
how much remains. For some kinds of archaeological material, the damage that has
been inﬂicted more by archaeologists and other academic or scholarly researchers
than by looters is already fatal. A case in point is the Upper Palaeolithic sites of the
British Isles,56 traces of the late glacial hunter-gatherers who repopulated Britain in

    25

the period before 10,000 years ago, when the peak of the glaciation was past and
the climate had warmed sufﬁciently to permit a human presence once more. There
never were, we think, many Upper Palaeolithic sites in Britain, and most of those
were in caves, not a numerous feature in Britain. Accordingly, most were soon ex-
cavated by archaeologists or others interested in cave deposits, and modern study
increasingly is limited by the paucity of material and of information from old
studies which has to substitute for new research.57 It is also the case that there is a
long habit, only now being broken, of individual archaeologists conducting ﬁeld-
work far faster than they can analyse the ﬁnds and publish the results, so that even
if they do not die prematurely, individuals often do not write up all their studies.
For broader categories in general, such as the classical antiquities of the Greek
world or the major sites of ancient Egypt, it is clear that the resource has been de-
pleted at an unsustainable rate far beyond anything that could be continued. With-
out quantitative studies in the spirit of the present one, it is impossible to estimate
with any useful accuracy just how much there was to begin with, just how much has
been excavated, just how much has been recovered by any means, and just how
much remains in the ground. The philosophical and ethical questions that fol-
low—how long do we expect that resource in the ground to have to last for, and
therefore at what rate can we reasonably consume it?—has not been answered; it
has barely been asked.

At Stonehenge, a genuinely unique site, the majority of the archaeological de-
posits have been destroyed in the course of archaeological study through the twen-
tieth century.58 Yet new research plans59 propose further destructive investigation
with some—but in the present authors’ view inadequate—regard for how much
has been so destroyed and how much remains in relation to the very many centuries
that Stonehenge may survive and be of interest into the future.

These are pioneering studies, and we are aware of difﬁculties with them. It was
only after they had tabulated several hundred items from the classical collections
that Chippindale and Gill began to fear that their distinction in the archaeologi-
cal classiﬁcations between “ﬁndspot known” and “ﬁndspot inferred” cannot reli-
ably be discerned from the information available, so these extremes in the range
of archaeological information offered might in fact be better melded together.

Overall, we think that the glum view expressed by Gill and Chippindale in re-
spect of Cycladic ﬁgures60 applies very widely. The material consequences have
been very damaging. Just how damaging depends, we suggest, on more quantitative
studies. It is only when one can express a loss of information as a proportion of
the potential quantity of information which either did once exist, or still exists,

26    .

that one can know whether that degree of loss is slight or catastrophic or some-
thing in between.

As more studies are made, so the larger picture will appear and in it—we

would anticipate—some consistent patterns.

At present, there exists a very wide range of views as regards the antiquities in
circulation on the private market and those being acquired outside their countries
of original origin. Those in the market contend that the illicit component is small;
those critical of the market contend that the illicit component is high or over-
whelming. Each side points to individual instances, or to the collected impression
gained through long experience, to indicate that its view is correct. The facts will
decide, and one means to establish the facts is through this kind of quantitative
study.

A common speciﬁc explanation for the surfacing of unprovenanced antiqui-
ties is that these seemingly new items are not illicit but are recycled from old 
collections, the owners of which choose not to identify themselves—for all sorts
of good reasons. We see this contention as a priori impossible for those classes of
antiquities not being collected decades ago when the old collections were being
formed. There can have been no terracottas from Mali in the old European collec-
tions formed before Malian terracottas were known to exist.

Until those quantitative facts are established, we have only the qualitative facts
of individual case studies.61 Nevertheless, there is already a noticeable pattern.
There are a mounting number of instances where it is proven or accepted that a
particular object or group of objects which surfaced without provenance in recent
decades were indeed illicitly removed from their countries of origin. We know of
no recent instance where a surfacing object or group of objects proves—when the
fuller story later comes to light—to have been recycled from old collections.

We see some account of history and/or archaeology is given for a certain pro-
portion of objects in the new classical collections, those that concentrate on classes
of objects long collected—Greek painted pottery, Greek and Roman sculpture,
and so on.

The case of Apulian Red Figure pottery, also classical, shows a striking his-
tory of changing attitudes. Initially South Italian was much desired and collected,
primarily in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries—the ﬁrst Greek
pottery esteemed by antiquarians, museums, and private collectors. Then, begin-
ning in the late 1820s, the Etruscan tombs were opened, revealing the Attic wares.
The fashion changed, and South Italian was relegated to a curiosity, desired more
for its instructive scenes of theatre and mythology than as itself an art tradition of
high merit. So there is a good quantity of South Italian, especially Apulian, in 
museum collections, most of it derived from older private collections. The mod-
ern wave of collecting began in the 1960s and 1970s; in the earlier decades of the
century, we do not know of private collectors specializing in this type of pottery.

    27

At that time many Apulian vases began to appear on the market, the aesthetic ap-
preciation changed, and many collectors began to specialize in Apulian. That pe-
riod was also one when looting in Apulia grew very much in scale. The questions,
then, are: What proportion of Apulian vases coming to light in the last forty or
so years is recycled from old collections? What proportion is from the new illicit
excavation and export? We see the contention that “surfacing” objects must be re-
cycled from old collections as a priori improbable for those classes of antiquities
where objects are known to be disappearing from the countries of origin in such
quantities and where objects of just the same type are surfacing without prove-
nance in the new collections and in the auction catalogues.

Mayan antiquities, again, have long been known, but it was comparatively re-
cently that they became a standard class of collected ancient art. One would also
forecast Mayan would have a low proportion demonstrably recycled from old col-
lections.

If this correlation proves consistent, then the likelihood of the old collections

being the source of most or many of these surfacing objects will be low.

The four studies reported here all lie in the domain of what Gill and Chip-
pindale call  “material consequences,”62 within which we include the immediate
consequences for scholarship of the information that does or does not accompany
individual ancient objects. Not addressed by them is the complementary realm of
“intellectual consequences,” the way in which classical scholarship is shaped and di-
rected in its frames of thinking by what the material is and how it comes to schol-
arly light. Those issues, as important as the material consequences, we hope to ad-
dress in another place.

We thank colleagues, especially Ricardo Elia, K. D. Vitelli, and Peter Watson, for advice and
guidance. Chippindale and Gill thank Hamilton and Salter for choosing to take up this area
of interest for their M. Phil. dissertation studies. Chippindale and Gill also thank the Archae-
ological Institute of America for inviting them to contribute to the Gold Medal Symposium
for Clemency Coggins at which a preliminary report of some of this work was made. An ear-
lier version of this paper was given at a conference on illicit antiquities at the MacDonald In-
stitute of Archaeology, University of Cambridge, in October 1999; we thank the MacDonald
Institute for that useful meeting, and the participants for useful discussions. That earlier ver-
sion was circulated as a preprint for the conference.
Papers from the Cambridge conference are now published: Neil Brodie, Jennifer Doole, and
Colin Renfrew (eds.), Trade in Illicit Antiquities: The Destruction of the World’s Archaeological Heritage
(McDonald Institute of Archaeology, Cambridge 2001). One classical study in it takes a quan-
titative approach much like ours: Ricardo J. Elia, Analysis of the Looting, Selling, and Col-
lecting of Apulian Red-Figure Vases: A Quantitative Approach, id. at 145– 53. Its conclusions are
strikingly consistent with ours. A non-Classical study in it also reports some numbers: Eliza-

Strikingly, that story in the Maya realm is also much the same as we see for classical: Mayan an-
tiquities, like Classical, are admired and highly valued as art objects; they have ‘surfaced’ on the
market in quantities without declared history or archaeology at a time of large-scale looting
in the countries of origin, much as classical antiquities continue to do. That close parallel is
an important indication that the particular shape the classical story takes is not due to the local
circumstances of classical antiquity or the Mediterranean world today but largely follows from
the attitudes of the market and its makers.

20. Because so many have no provenance, we are obliged to suppose “most or nearly all or all
seem to have been made and originally deposited” in the islands, rather than to know that as
a fact. Strictly, the position is this: nearly all the Cycladic ﬁgures whose archaeological context
is reliably known were found in the Cycladic islands, and many of the others are said to be from
the Cyclades.

28. “Provenance” has been used with so many meanings that we think it is no longer a clear
word and we think it now best used only as a very general term. A fuller account of the mean-
ings of provenance and why we think it no longer a clear word appears in Chippindale and Gill,

supra note 10. That text, as submitted, used the words “archaeology” and “history” as we use
them in the present text. The editors of that journal, requesting and requiring revision in the
usual way, had us use the word “ﬁndspot” in place of “archaeology,” and that is what appears
in the published paper (see especially its pp. 469– 70). Still thinking “archaeology” is the bet-
ter word, we use it here.
The quality and quantity of information about the archaeology of an item varies; certainly, it
often consists simply of a place-name for the spot it was found—the “ﬁndspot.” A good ac-
count of the archaeology of an object is a much fuller record than that.

an exact enumeration of the corpus, individual ﬁgure by ﬁgure, of the kind carried out for the
classical study. The need remains to explore the Cycladic corpus, ﬁgure by ﬁgure, on an indi-
vidual basis.

since that is what it was at the time of its exhibition. Also, this means elements in the present
