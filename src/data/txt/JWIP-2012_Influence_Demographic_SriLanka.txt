The remarkable growth of patent applications in Asia has been the central focus of the recent studies on
technological knowledge creation. However, all the Asian countries have not shown similar growth and hence,
have not gained similar academic attention. Especially, the lower and middle-income countries in South Asia
are stagnating in technological knowledge creation. Sri Lanka is one such country that has high proportion
of independent inventors in their innovation system. Owing to small number of inventors, there is hardly any
attention given to conduct empirical studies on inventors in these countries. Therefore, inherent characteristics
of inventors and innovation systems in these countries are underexplored in published academic literature. This
pioneering study attempted to explore the inherent characteristics of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka as
the representatives of inventors in middle-income South Asian developing countries. The ﬁndings of the study
suggest that most of the sociodemographic and technical characteristics of Sri Lankan inventors are similar to
the independent inventors in industrial countries. It also indicates that demographic factors such as age, income,
job mobility, marital status and technical factors such as engagement in inventions, prototype development and
commercialization method have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the overall innovation success of independent inventors
in Sri Lanka.

Keywords Southern Asia; patents; technology transfer

Asia is a region that has shown signiﬁcant development in technological knowledge creation in recent
years; however, every country in Asia has not achieved equal-level improvement (Urata, 2007). The
number of patents, patent applications and patent citations has been the widely accepted criteria to
compare the technological knowledge creation among the nations in recent literature (Hu, 2009).
According to the recent patent application data in Asia, there is a noticeable disparity in patent
applications among the Asian countries (WIPO, 2007). According to the statistics, Japan, Korea,
China and India are moving neck and neck with the western industrial countries (Palangkaraya,
2010). Further, China, Korea and India have inﬂuenced the neighboring southeast Asian countries
to emerge as technologically enabled countries (Stuart-Fox, 2004; Urata, 2011). With this emerging
trend, countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong also have grown rapidly as
newly industrial countries with relatively higher number of patent applications. However, except
for India, countries in South Asia have not shown signiﬁcant growth in technological knowledge
creation. This has created a signiﬁcant disparity in technological knowledge creation among the
nations in Asia (Kim et al., 2011).

The majority of published literature explains the nature of innovation systems in emerging
countries. Even though the literature evidence are readily available on the dynamism of technological
knowledge creation in emerging countries in Asia, so far no proper attention was given to learn
about the innovation systems in less-inventive nations in South Asia that have not achieved higher

numbers in local inventions (Chen and Puttitanun, 2005). Hence, it is important to get to know about
who are the local inventors, what are their characteristics and behaviors in less-innovative developing
countries in Asia to help them to be enabled in technological knowledge creation in coming years
(Intarakumnerd et al., 2002; Nam and Barnett, 2011). However, the existing empirical knowledge
about the inventive community in developing countries is insufﬁcient to explain the true nature of
the inventive communities in developing countries (Diyamett and Mabala, 2007; Weick and Eakin,
2005).

This paper aims to explore the inherent characteristics of the independent inventive community
of Sri Lanka as the representatives of inventors in middle-income South Asian developing countries
that are not technologically developed as China, Korea, India or other southeast Asian counterparts.
First, this paper explains the composition of Sri Lankan innovation system based on the number of
patent applications in last decade. Second, based on the ﬁndings of ﬁrst ever survey conducted on
inventors in Sri Lanka, this paper explores the signiﬁcant demographic and technical characteristics
of Sri Lankan independent inventors. Finally, authors compare the demographic and technical
characteristics of Sri Lankan independent inventors with their Overall Innovation Success to explore
the impact of demographic and technical factors on the success of inventors.

Context of the Study
Sri Lanka is a multiethnic, lower middle-income island nation in South Asia with 21 million mid-year
populations. Sri Lanka has comparatively higher human development index than rest of the South
Asian countries, but she has fallen behind the technological development compared to the neigh-
boring countries in Asia (Dissanayake, 2003). Exports of garments and textiles, worker remittance,
tea and tourism have been the major sources of export income and 81% of the import expenses
have been spent on intermediate and investment imports (Central bank of Sri Lanka, 2008). During
the last decade, the import dependency on industrial and technological products of Sri Lanka has
been drastically shifted from western countries to Asian countries. In the year 2008, 73% of total
imports of Sri Lanka originated from India (24%), Singapore (9%), China (8%), Hong Kong (5%)
and other Asian and Middle Eastern countries (51%) (Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2008). The number
of resident patent applications in Sri Lanka is not very high; however, there is a steady increase of
patent applications in recent years. Further, the number of independent inventors in Sri Lanka has
drastically increased since the last decade (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011).

Recent patent statistics have shown a signiﬁcant percentage of independent inventions in the
national patent system of Sri Lanka (Table 1). From the total resident patent applications, 77% of
the applications have been forwarded by the independent inventors. It has increased up to 80% and
85% in years 2007 and 2008, respectively. Albeit, the business environment in Sri Lanka has not
encouraged the local inventors, independent inventors have not discouraged. They have been the
driving force of the Sri Lankan innovation system.

Apart from the signiﬁcant proportion of independent inventors, independent inventions in Sri
Lanka have shown high technical merits as well. Some of the inventions were recognized among the
best inventions in the world. In the 37th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva 2009, Sri
Lankan independent inventors have won the prestigious World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) award and the International Press Award. Sri Lankan invention of “safety kerosene lamp”
also won the BBC World Challenge 2009 award as the best invention of the competition. Further, all
the best inventor’s awards at the annual presidential awards for Sri Lankan inventors in 2006 and 2007
were won by the independent inventors. Unfortunately, the majority of the award-winning inventors
were unable to achieve high level of commercial success for their inventions (Wickramasinghe, panel
discussions with Sri Lankan grassroots-level inventors, 2010).

Methodology
Theoretical Framework of the Study
There are a number of studies that have explained the nature of the inﬂuences on individual character-
istics of success (Carbonell et al., 2011; Nga and Shamuganathan, 2010; Wang et al., 2011). Among
the individual characteristics, demographic and work-related technical factors are recognized as the
most general inﬂuential factors of career success. Past studies on independent inventors in industrial
countries also have investigated the inﬂuences of demographic and technical factors on commercial
success of independent inventors (Amesse and Desranleau, 1991; Georgia Tech Enterprise Innova-
tion Institute, 2008; Weick and Eakin, 2005). The present study is the preliminary investigation of
the inventors in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the authors focused on exploring demographic and technical
factors of inventors in the ﬁrst place. Second, these factors were considered as the exogenous factors
that might have inﬂuence on the success of independent inventors in Sri Lanka.

Innovation is a long process, which has a number of milestones to be achieved to attain suc-
cess. Therefore, in order to measure the overall success of inventors, achievements in different stages
of innovation process need to be considered (Hauschildt, 1991). The commercial success is only
a high-end outcome of innovation process. It has not been able to measure the success in differ-
ent stages of innovation process. Existing standalone measurements of innovation success such as
the number of patents, scientiﬁc awards/grants, patent citations, commercialized inventions and
return on investments have never considered all stages of the innovation process. Therefore, in-
ﬂuence of demographic and technical factors on overall inventive success has never been studied
thoroughly.

Theoretical framework of the present study designed to address the knowledge gap by intro-
ducing new cumulative innovation success index as the measurement of the inventive success of the
independent inventors in Sri Lanka. Based on the existing ﬁndings of the individual factors and
success, the researchers hypothesized that the demographic and technical proﬁle factors of the inde-
pendent inventors in Sri Lanka might also contribute to their overall success of innovation process
activities (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Theoretical Framework of the Study

Operationalization
The present study adopted the Hauschildt (1991) innovation process approach to measure the Overall
Innovation Success of the inventors. Overall Innovation Success deﬁned as the measurable and
observable monetary and nonmonitory achievements of the innovation process, which includes the
patent received, awards and rewards, commercialization, commercial survival and proﬁt earnings.
The researcher initially developed the Overall Innovation Success measurement as ten-item Likert-
like scale and asked the selected panel of experts to validate the scale. When the researcher consulted
Professor Chinta Weick, she advised the researcher to use limited number of items with dichotomous
response because that is straightforward to measure and avoid complex comparisons (Weick C,
Personal Communication, 12 August 2008). Weick and Eakin (2005) also measured the commercial
success of inventors using multi-item dichotomous (0, 1) scale. To eliminate the inﬂuence of the
number of inventions, researchers adopted a dichotomous scale by asking the questions on whether
the inventors have at least single invention achieved success at each stage. Overall Innovation Success
was calculated as the summation of ﬁve items measured through the dichotomous scale (0, 1) on
the patent grants, award and rewards, commercial startup, commercial continuation and proﬁtable
inventions. When the inventors had at least one invention that satisﬁes the criteria of each question,
they were considered successful at the respective stage of the innovation process. In the questionnaire,
the researcher asked the respondents to state how many patents they received, how many inventions
have won either awards or rewards, how many inventions started to commercialized, how many
inventions still been commercialized and how many inventions earned proﬁts at the time of survey.
Respondents who reported values 1 or more were considered as successful (1) and others considered
as unsuccessful (0) at the respective innovation process stage. By calculating the summation of
dichotomous responses, the researcher generated the continuous Overall Innovation Success index
ranging from 0 to 5. These ﬁve values were categorized as very low, low, moderate, high and very
high success (Hair et al., 2009).

Research Design and Data Analysis
Owing to the relatively small number of independent inventors, empirical studies on independent
inventors in developing Asian countries are rare (Mahmood and Singh, 2003). Likewise, there are
hardly any published empirical studies on the inventors in Sri Lanka (Wickramasinghe et al., 2010).
Hence, the researchers had to design the present study as an exploratory research. In order to
achieve the ﬁrst objective of the study, researchers collected secondary data from the patent database
of Sri Lanka National Intellectual Property Ofﬁce and Central Bank of Sri Lanka. To achieve the

368

subsequent objectives, researchers collected the primary data from the randomly selected respondents
from the Sri Lankan Inventive community.

In the year 2010, the researchers conducted the ﬁrst independent inventors survey in Sri Lanka.
The aim of the survey was to understand the demographic and technical proﬁles of Sri Lankan
inventors to assess their inherent strengths (and weaknesses) to be successful inventors. Two hundred
inventors were randomly selected as the sample of the study from population of 640 patent-applied
inventors. Sample size represented the 31% of the target population.

Selected inventors were asked to come for data-collection panels conducted in selected districts in
Sri Lanka. Respondents were given self-administrative questionnaire to provide required information
about them and their inventive activities. Demographic and technical proﬁles of the respondents were
analyzed using descriptive statistics. According to the inherent nature of the phenomena, the majority
of the demographic and technical factor variables of the study are collected as nominal or ordinal
data. The measurement of the overall innovation success is a continuous variable. Hence, the analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was selected as the appropriate statistical analysis tool to achieve the ﬁnal
objective of the study. The researchers conducted the exploratory data analysis to test whether the
data met the normality assumption in ANOVA. The absolute skew index and kurtosis index of the
overall innovation success were .265 and 1.011, respectively. Both the indices satisﬁed the recommend
cut off criteria of skewness (<3) and kurtosis (<7) values to satisfy the normality assumption of
dependent variable in ANOVA (Kline, 2011).

Findings
Who Are the Independent Inventors in Sri Lanka
Demographic Proﬁle of Inventors
According to the data collected from the respondents, the researchers were able to determine the
major demographic characteristics of Sri Lankan independent inventors (Table 2).

1. The majority of independent inventors are middle-aged inventors with average age of 42 years.
2. Independent

inventors in Sri Lanka are predominantly the males, with only 5% of

females.

3. Most of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka are married, where two-thirds of the inventors

were married.

4. According to the political administrative deﬁnition, the majority of the independent inventors re-
side in rural areas; however population density wise, majority of inventors are living in metropoli-
tan districts.

5. Generally, the independent inventors in Sri Lanka are a well-educated group where majority had

completed at least formal upper secondary level school education.

6. Independent inventors in Sri Lanka are largely the part-time inventors, where 65% inventors

employed in formal employments.

7. Independent inventors in Sri Lanka largely represent the middle-income group of the country.

The ﬁndings of demographic factors revealed that the average independent inventor in Sri Lanka
is an educated, married, middle-aged male who lived in rural areas of an urban district. Then again,
three of ﬁve inventors were part-time inventors and majority has received medium-level income.
These ﬁndings are similar to the ﬁndings of the previous studies that were conducted on independent
inventors in western industrial countries. Winston (1937) in the United States, Macdonalds (1986)
in Australia, Sirilli (1987) in Italy, Amesse et al. (1991) in Canada, Whalley (1992) in the United
States, Wieck and Eakin (2005) again in the United States, Giuri et al. (2007) in Europe and Georgia

Tech Enterprise Innovation Institute (2007) in Georgia have revealed that an average independent
inventor is middle-aged, educated, employed, married male who has middle-level income. Further,
inventors in Asian industrial countries also have shown identical demographic proﬁle (Walsh and
Nagaoka, 2009). Hence, ﬁndings of the present study suggest that the demographic proﬁles of
the independent inventors in Sri Lanka also parallel with the demographic proﬁle of independent
inventors in industrial world.

Technical Proﬁle of Inventors
In the present study, independent inventors’ technical proﬁle was examined by the type of invention,
ﬁeld of invention, inventive lifespan, engagement in invention, internet usage, number of working
prototypes and commercialization efforts. Based on the responses of the respondents, researchers
were able to explain the technical proﬁle of the Sri Lankan independent inventors (Table 3), which is
as follows:

1. The independent inventors in Sri Lanka are mostly the radical product inventors.
2. Most of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka have mainly involved in agriculture, environment

or energy and household equipments inventions.

3. The majority of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka is generally the immature inventors with

3 years or less experience in inventing.

4. The majority of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka generally develop at least one working

prototype of their inventions.

5. Independent inventors in Sri Lanka generally prefer to commercialize their inventions by their

own.

6. Independent inventors in Sri Lanka are generally moderate-level internet users.

The study found that average Sri Lankan independent inventor is an immature radical product
inventor who mainly invents in ﬁelds of agricultural, environmental, medical, industrial equipment
and household equipment. The majority of the inventors have only one or two signiﬁcant inventions
and most of them tried to commercialize their invention on their own. However, one-third of the
inventors have not even tried to commercialize their inventions. The internet is a promising medium
of gaining knowledge and sharing information; however one-fourth of the inventors have shown
low-level internet usage. The majority has shown moderate-level internet usage. According to the
results, more than one-half of the respondents had only less than 3 years of postpatent application
experience as inventors. It clearly indicates the immaturity and the growing nature of the independent
inventive community in recent years. Further, the ﬁndings indicated that a signiﬁcant number of
independent inventors have engaged in inventing activities as part-time inventors and in expanded
ﬁelds of inventions. This indicates the tendency of the continuous expansions of both the depth and
breadth of independent inventive community in Sri Lanka.

Overall Innovation Success of Inventors
Overall Innovation Success and its sub-indicators of the respondent inventors are shown in Table 4.
According to sub-indicators presented in Table 4, respondent independent inventors have achieved
high-level patent success (M= .795, SD= .405). Further, they have achieved average-level commercial
success (M = .590, SD = .493) by taking at least one of their inventions to the market. However,
award-winning success (M = .395, SD = .490), market-survival success (M = .370, SD = .484) and
proﬁt-earning success (M = .370, SD = .484) indicate that the majority of the inventors has only
achieved low-level success in back-end innovation activities. Therefore, independent inventors have
faced problems in back-end inventive process activities that are related to commercialization and
marketing stages of the inventive products and processes. Owing to lower success level especially
in back-end inventive activities, overall innovation success index of the respondent inventors have
shown average-level success (M = 2.52, SD = 1.49). Hence, in general, independent inventors in Sri
Lanka are moderately successful inventors in their inventive life.

Inﬂuence of Demographic and Technical Factors on Success
According to the ANOVA results presented in Table 5, demographic factors such as income (F =
3.852, p = .000), age (F = 2.562, p = .029), job mobility (F = 3.505, p = .032) and marital status
(F = 4.086, p = .045) have shown signiﬁcant effect on overall innovation success of the respondent
inventors. According to the mean comparison of the overall innovation success, the researchers found
that the high-income group gains high success than the low-income group. Then again middle-aged
inventors achieved higher success than the young and older inventors. Inventors who had low job
mobility have achieved high success than the inventors with high job mobility. Furthermore, married
inventors achieved higher success than the unmarried inventors. According to the results, employment
sector had somewhat signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the success, but it only statistically signiﬁcant at .1 levels.
Meanwhile, demographic factors such as living location (F = 2.083, p = .151) and education level
(F = 0.549, p = .650) have not shown signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the success even at .1 level.
Second part of Table 5 indicates the inﬂuence of technical factors on the overall innovation
success of the inventors. According to the results, engagement in inventions (F = 10.835, p =
.000), Prototype development (F = 11.175, p = .000) and commercialization method (F = 18.900,
p = .000) have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the Overall Innovation Success. According to the detailed
mean comparison, inventors who spend more time in inventive activities achieved higher success
than inventors who spend less time in inventions. Further, inventors who develop more working
prototypes of their inventions achieved higher success than the inventors those who did not develop

more prototypes. Then again, inventors who tried to commercialize their inventions by their own
have achieved higher success than the inventors who tried licensing, outright sales and knowledge
dissemination of their inventions.

There is signiﬁcant argument in the world to increase technological innovation in developing
countries through the knowledge transfer through the internet. However, the results of the study only
indicate mediocre inﬂuence of internet usage on the innovation success of independent inventors in
Sri Lanka (F = 2.532, p = .082). Further, type of invention (F = 1.061, p = .304), ﬁeld of inventions
(F= 0.691, p= .733) and inventive lifespan (F= 0.548, p= .579) of the inventors have not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced their overall innovation success.

Discussion
The consistency of the results of the present study and past studies in industrial countries has
indicated the universally similar demographic proﬁles among the independent inventors. It suggests
there are common demographic characteristics among the inventors that would stimulate the creative
and inventive skills in any favorable or unfavorable conditions. Therefore, in general, the independent
inventors belong to common demographic proﬁle, no matter where they reside, either in developed
or developing countries. Hence, the independent inventors in developing countries such as Sri Lanka
should also be treated as the equal members of the global independent inventive community.

The major difference between the demographic proﬁles of the past studies and present study was
the geographical locations of the inventors. According to past studies, average inventors are living in
metropolitan areas in the industrial countries. Most of the western countries deﬁned the urban and
rural areas based on the population density, but Sri Lanka has deﬁned the rural and urban areas
based on the nature of the governing council than the population density (United Nations, 2007).
Therefore, in political sense, the majority of the grassroots inventors in Sri Lanka are rural-based
inventors. However, the results of the present study indicate that the majority of the independent
inventors have pooled in districts that have high population density. Therefore, in principle, ﬁnding

C(cid:2) 373

C. N. Wickramasinghe and Nobaya Ahmad

Demographic, Technical Proﬁle and Success

on geographical location of independent inventors in Sri Lanka aligns with the western studies that
had indicated higher number of independent inventions in metropolitan areas (Carlino et al., 2007;
Sonn and Storper, 2008). This ﬁnding also indicates that the urbanization and urban issues might
have higher inﬂuence on people to be involved in the inventions than in the rural problems in rural
areas. This might be owing to the higher level of access to the information and availability of other
basic ingredients for technological inventions in urban areas of the country.

Several past studies on the demographic proﬁles of inventors also give attention to the technical
proﬁles of the inventors in industrial countries. However, none has examined all the aspects of
technical proﬁle of inventors in a single study. Meyer (2004) and Dahlin et al. (2004) found that
majority of the independent inventors were radical inventors. Studies of Astebro (2003), Georgia
Tech Enterprise Innovation Institute (2008) and Weick and Eakin (2005) examined the ﬁeld of
invention and found that household and consumer equipments, environment and energy, automotive
and medical devices were among the top inventive ﬁelds among independent inventors. However,
agricultural inventions had not among the most popular ﬁelds. This may be a result of the inﬂuence
of the industrial development of those countries. Historically, Sri Lanka has been an agriculture-
based economy. Hence, the independent inventors have natural tendency toward ﬁnding solutions to
the technical issues in agro-industry.

The ﬁndings of inventive lifespan of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka align with the
argument of Wieck and Eakin (2005) on full-time and part-time independent inventors. They found
that majority of the independent inventors are having less than 5 years of inventive life. Meanwhile,
Whalley (1992) and Weick and Eakin (2005) have examined the number of working prototypes
developed by the independent inventors. Whalley (1992) had found that there were very limited
numbers of inventors, who had developed ﬁnal-level prototypes of their inventions. However, Weick
and Eakin (2005) have revealed that more than one-half of the inventors have at least one working
prototypes. Compared to earlier studies, Sri Lankan independent inventors have a higher number of
working prototypes.

Commercialization methods among the Sri Lankan independent inventors have the similar trend
as the industrial country inventors. Studies of Whalley (1992), Parker et al. (1996) and Wieck and
Eakin (2005) revealed that nearly one-third of the inventors have never tried to take any of their
inventions to the market. Then again, according to their studies, the majority of the inventors wanted
to commercialize their inventions by their own. Present study also revealed the similar pattern, where
the 34% of the inventors never tried any of the commercialization methods, and the majority who
wanted to commercialize their inventions has tried to do it on their own. A substantial number
of intentional noncommercialized inventions indicate that unlike employed inventors, independent
inventors might not go after the commercialization whole heartedly.

Past studies have mentioned that internet is one of the major sources from which inventors can
get inventive ideas (Ibrahim and Fallah, 2005). Georgia Tech (2007) identiﬁed that internet is one of
the top three resources among the Georgian inventors. However, compared to those studies, internet
usage among Sri Lankan inventors was lower than the expected level. According to the explanation
of the inventors, even though they use public internet access to communicate with others through
e-mails, more than one-half was not using internet for patent search, information or knowledge
search in their inventive activities. This might have happened due to the lack of awareness and limited
internet access available to the inventors. Owing to the low usage of internet, their awareness and
knowledge about existing inventions and commercialized innovations were substantially lower. This
might be a reason for their high involvement in radical inventions than the incremental inventions.
Further, most of the inventors mentioned that they do not have internet connection at their home,
but are very keen to have and learn how to use it in their inventive activities (Wickramasinghe, 2010).

According to the internet penetration data, Sri Lanka has very low rating compared to industrial
countries. Only 8.3% of the population has the internet access (Miniwatts Marketing Group, 2010).
Therefore, limited internet access of the general population also reﬂected within the independent
inventors in Sri Lanka.

Findings of the overall innovation success of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka indicate that
they have only achieved low-level success due to their lower success in back-end inventive activities.
Previous studies on independent inventors in industrial countries also indicated that independent
inventors are not successful entrepreneurs (Astebro, 1998; Weick and Eakin, 2005). Even though
the invention and entrepreneurship are at the two ends of the innovation process, each end required
unique and specialized knowledge. Inventors might be good at inventing new product or process,
but they are not necessarily capable to convert the invention into successful product (Kevin, 2009).
Self-commercialization provides the best opportunity for the inventors to market their inventions as
they wish. However, when the inventors lack knowledge in technological product market mechanism,
self-commercialization becomes counterproductive.

Conclusion and Recommendations
Along with the inﬂuential demographic factors such as age, marital status, income and job mo-
bility, results have shown that high engagement in inventive activities, prototype development and
commercialization type inﬂuenced the overall innovation success of the inventors. When considering
these factors, age, marital status and engagement in invention inﬂuence the inventors’ strengths, time
and commitment on inventive activities. Further, income and job mobility provide the ﬁnances and
technical knowledge for inventive activities, respectively. Despite of these factors largely inﬂuence the
successful invention, prototype development and commercialization type are the necessary back-end
activities that bridge gap between independent inventors’ bold inventive idea and marketable product.
Business organizations, governments and universities have been recognized as the key players
in national innovation systems in less successful developing countries (Intarakumnerd et al., 2002).
There is no encouragement for independent inventors in modern business environment. Hence, the
growth of independent inventions in Sri Lanka is not a generally expected scenario in the modern
society. This controversial growth of the independent inventors in Sri Lanka has raised the questions
on who are the independent inventors and what are the explicit factors of these inventors that motivate
them to be involved in inventive activities in the environment that consider their independent nature,
survival and growth as the indications of primitive innovation system. According to Lundvall (2008),
most successful economies in the world are those where the ordinary people are involved in progresses
of creative thinking (Lundvall, 2008). Further, according to the Diyamett and Mabala (2007) poor
attention given to the informal inventors in developing countries is one of the reasons for their lower
technological development (Diyamett and Mabala, 2007). Wieck and Eaken (2005) have mentioned
that owing to the signiﬁcance of the independent inventions in developing countries, they need to
be identiﬁed as a major element of the technological development efforts in developing countries.
The present study provides pioneering explanations and framework of the independent inventors in
developing country such as Sri Lanka to make them think beyond the narrow deﬁnitions of inventors
as the novel utilization of indigenous knowledge and grassroots inventors in rural communities.
Therefore, the present study has ended the long-standing drought of empirical studies on overview
of the patent-applied independent inventors in developing countries in South Asia.

Most of the Overall Innovation Success measures, demographic and technical characteristics of
the independent inventors in Sri Lanka are identical with the characteristics of independent inventors
explained in the western industrial countries. Owing to the inherent demographic, and technical factor

C(cid:2) 375

C. N. Wickramasinghe and Nobaya Ahmad

Demographic, Technical Proﬁle and Success

anatomy that is similar to independent inventors identiﬁed by other countries, the ﬁnding suggests
that the independent inventors are typically look-alike wherever they reside. Hence, the majority of
the demographic, technical and success factors explained in the present study might be the common
universal anatomy of the independent inventors. This common anatomy of the inventors suggests
that the inherent characteristics within the Sri Lankan independent inventors might have driven them
to be continually involved in inventive activities. Even though the social and environmental factors
are not identical and supporting as the industrial countries, the independent inventors will not stop
their inventive activities even in the unfavorable and unsupportive environments such as Sri Lanka.
Unavailability of acceptable mechanism to identify the independent inventors in developing
countries has been a serious problem for their local innovation development efforts (Wettansinha
et al., 2008). Hence, the demographic and technical proﬁle of the independent inventors explained
by the present study would be one of the most comprehensive bottom-up frameworks to explain
the independent inventors in low- and middle-income countries. Even though the ﬁndings of the
study explain the size, structure and nature of the independent inventive community in Sri Lanka,
in broader sense, the demographic and technical proﬁle found in the present study would be useful
to identify and explain the structures and behaviors of inventive communities in other developing
countries. It would allow them to develop asset-based technological development by overcoming
needs and problems in their innovation systems.

The present study mainly focused on providing the bird’s eye view of the independent inventors
and their success level in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is not possible to answer all the pertinent ques-
tions of the innovation system in Sri Lanka. Therefore, future researchers are expected to conduct
more relational studies to understand the inﬂuences of demographic, technical, psychological and
social factors on the innovation process activities of the local innovation systems in Sri Lanka and
other Asian developing countries to get more in-depth empirical knowledge about their innovation
systems.
