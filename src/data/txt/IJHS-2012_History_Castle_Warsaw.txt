especially visual arts, as well as vernacular forms of artistic expression and heritage studies.

Notes
1. The entire quotation is as follows:

History, like art and sport, is not a ﬁxed entity but an activity. History is the story we
are constantly telling ourselves to explain to ourselves just how we come to be where
we think we are. History, truly considered, is a verb, not an abstract noun. We history.
From which it follows that history is not given, but made. The story that we tell
ourselves is a form of self-deﬁnition and is, therefore, and unavoidably, an ethical enter-
prise. (Brett 1996, p. 4)

2. By 1964 Jan Zachwatowicz, the Polish signatory of the Venice Charter, had already car-
ried out several reconstruction works in Warsaw’s Old Town and Royal Route that
included a reconstruction in toto of Warsaw Cathedral and a complete redesign of its
façade in the so-called ‘Mazovian Gothic’ style. He also was to become, in 1971, the
Chief Conservator for the in toto reconstruction of the Royal Castle in Warsaw; more
about his activities follows, but see also Martyn (2001).

3. The most recent large post-World War II reconstruction in toto was the Dresden Frauen-

kirche, consecrated in 2005.

4. The offensive of spring/summer 1915 on the eastern front switched Polish territories
from Russian rule to German and Austro-Hungarian rule. The policy of the new occu-
pants was more friendly towards the Poles than that of the Russians and an independent
Kingdom of Poland was promised.

5. The writers Stefan Żeromski and Stanisław Przybyszewski

lived in the castle in

1921–1925 and 1924–1927, respectively.

6. The style of the Renaissance was considered at the time the Golden-Age style, epitomis-
ing the greatness of Polish past; the vista terrace in Warsaw seems closely related to the
so-called ‘altana’ (a semi-opened terrace, or loggia) constructed by Szyszko-Bohusz in
1922–1924 in Wawel, above another Gothic tower incorporated in the Cracow castle.
The post-war reconstruction in Warsaw did not include Szyszko-Bohusz’s developments.
7. All translations from Polish, unless otherwise indicated, are by the author.
8. On 17 September 1939 President Mościcki left the national territory and on 30 Septem-

ber he resigned from ofﬁce.

9. The National Museum, unlike the castle, was a municipal institution, so the city mayor

was entitled to delegate its director to do the task (Rottermund 2003, p. 7).

10. I use the name ‘Royal Route’ for the most northern part of an historic route connecting
several royal residences in the centre and on the outskirts of the city to the south. It con-
sists of two consecutive streets, Krakowskie Przedmieście and Nowy Świat, which were
reconstructed within the scope of the Six-Year Plan. Neither of them was rebuilt accord-
ing to the pre-war photographs, and in the case of Krakowskie Przedmieście vedutas by
Bernardo Belotto were used as inspiration for the reconstruction of a Warsaw that had
existed ‘before the city’s disﬁgurement during large-scale urban growth in the second
half of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries’ (Martyn 2001, p. 211).
Peter Martyn offers the following comment: ‘In conservationist terms, to recreate entire
architectural ensembles on the basis of a set of paintings that were almost two hundred
years old, for all its bravura, was not only reckless but unprofessional’ (Martyn 2001, p.
211), especially because ‘painters tend to permit themselves a certain amount of license
in what they do, and Bernardo Belotto was absolutely no exception to the rule’ (Martyn
2001, p. 211). The most recent developments in Krakowskie Przedmieście, after the ren-
ovation of the street in 2006–2008, include full-sized copies of Belotto’s vedutas sealed
in acrylic glass blocks located in the spots from where the painter presumably had cast
his eye. The continuity between the past and present established in such a way legitimis-

es the restoration efforts, and at the same time perpetuates the version of the city’s his-
tory informed by the post-World War II ideological struggle.

11. The ofﬁcial documents of the Polish People’s Republic tended to avoid the adjective
‘royal’ in the name of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, which made the building ‘the Castle
of Warsaw’, or ‘Warsaw’s Castle’ (Polish: Zamek Warszawski instead of Zamek Królew-
ski w Warszawie).

12. In March 1971, Gomułka, recently removed from power, wrote:

I have never been and I will never be an advocate of the castle’s reconstruction, or, putt-
ing it more accurately, the construction of a new one, as from the old nothing had been
left.. . . My question is: what traditions are we evoking here? . . .After all, this castle is a
symbol of anarchy; almost every single parliament session held there had been blocked
by the aristocratic ‘liberum veto’; it was there where venal and despicable Polish kings
lived;
it was there where under the bayonets of foreign powers the partitions were
proclaimed. . . .The Warsaw Castle is not a symbol of Polish statehood. It is a symbol of
doom, both to the state of the Polish aristocracy and nobility, as well as to the state of
the Polish bourgeoisie (quoted in Pleskaczyńska 2003a, p. 54).

13. Minutes of meetings of the executive committee of OKOZK are housed in the Archives
of the Royal Castle of Warsaw. I would like to thank the Director and staff of the Royal
Castle of Warsaw (RCW) for their assistance in my research; I owe special thanks to the
Archive Section employees, especially Ms Dominika Sobolewska.

15. The reconstruction was supervised by OKOZK and realised by different specialised
bodies, among them the ‘Royal Castle’ unit of the National Museum of Warsaw. On 1
October 1980 the unit transferred its duties to the Royal Castle of Warsaw – MNHC
(Rottermund 2003, p. 11).

19. Here I quote the oral version I heard from a guide; in his memoirs, Lorentz writes that
Governor Hans Frank, during his ﬁrst visit to Warsaw Castle on 10 October 1939, ‘with
his own hands was tearing off the canopy of the royal throne the eagles embroidered in sil-
ver, encouraging dignitaries who accompanied him to do the same’ (Lorentz 1986, p. 14).
20. The title was ‘Polish King’ and not ‘King of Poland’; this is clear from the phrase ‘tytuł
Króla Polskiego’ [title of Polish King], which was used instead of ‘tytuł Króla Polski’
[title of the King of Poland]. The difference was politically important, as the country
had been divided among three parties, and Russia held only a share of the former
national territory of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Interestingly, in the nominative
case the difference disappears, with both forms becoming Król Polski (here ‘Polski’
could be either the adjective ‘Polish’ in the nominative case or the noun ‘Polska’
[Poland] in the genitive case).
