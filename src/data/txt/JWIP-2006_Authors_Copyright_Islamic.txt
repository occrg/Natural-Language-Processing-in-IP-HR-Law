Author’s Copyright: An Islamic Perspective

Muhammad Amanullah

International Islamic University Malaysia

Nowadays, most people have lost their attribute of trustworthiness. Therefore, cheating,
harming, deceiving and neglecting the rights of others have become the order of the day.
Among these rights is the copyright of an author over his own written materials. It is
considered to be stealing if someone publishes, in his own name, materials written by others,
or if someone uses materials of others in articles or books without proper acknowledgement
of their authors. However, in order to conduct smoothly the process of learning, teaching and
research, frequently lecturers and students need to photocopy materials written by others,
who have protected their copyright by writing on them ‘‘All rights reserved’’. When a student
needs to prepare a paper, or a lecturer needs to prepare a lesson or to write a paper or book,
sometimes he does not have the time to write a letter to the relevant authors to receive their
permission. On the other hand, if this permission were sought by thousands of people from a
single author or publisher, it would be difﬁcult for him to respond properly to all of them.
The objectives of this article, therefore, are to highlight Islamic rulings for several issues
related to copyright; and to determine how far this copyright should be reserved for the
author, and how far a student or lecturer is allowed Islamically to copy the materials written
by others. In order to reach these objectives, the relevant verses of the Qur’an and ahadith of
the Prophet (peace be upon him) and opinions of Muslim jurists are analytically discussed to
ﬁnd out preferable views in this regard. This article is divided into the following sections:
introduction; whether an author has the right to have monetary compensation for his work;
conditions for the protection of copyright; plagiarism versus permitted quotation; copying or
printing a published book without the permission of its author; and a conclusion.

Introduction

Islam encourages acquiring knowledge and spreading it among the public. The
Prophet says:
‘‘Seeking knowledge is obligatory for each Muslim (male and
female)’’.1 He also states: ‘‘Seek knowledge even if it happens to be in China’’.2
Likewise, he commends Muslims to spread knowledge by saying: ‘‘Convey from me
even if it is only a single verse.’’3 Moreover, knowledge is so important and useful
that, even after the death of its acquirer, he would get beneﬁt and reward from it
even after he has gone to his grave. The Prophet says: ‘‘When a son of Adam dies his
deeds are disconnected from him except from three things, i.e. a continuing charity
(sadaqah jariyah), useful knowledge, and righteous child who does supplication for
him’’.4 The most important method of spreading knowledge today is to collect and
write it in books or articles and publish them. Writing was known to Muslims from

r  r 301

Muhammad Amanullah

Author’s Copyright

the beginning of Islam when they started writing the Qur’an following the revelation
of each verse and surah. Thus, the full Qur’an was written during the lifetime of the
Prophet, although it was scattered in different types of materials. Then it was
collected in a single volume during the caliphate of Abu Bakr.

An important aspect related to writing is the copyright of the author. Although
early Muslims, as it exists today, did not know about copyright, they were very
strict to have authentic texts of the Qur’an and hadith of the Prophet. In order to
achieve this authenticity, the ﬁrst caliph Abu Bakr had ordered Hassan ibn Thabith
to collect each verse and surah of the Qur’an with the witness and acknowledgement
of at least two Muslims. For the sake of unity in recitation and continuation of its
authenticity, during the caliphate of U` thman, the original Qur’an collected during
Abu Bakr was copied and distributed all over the Muslim world of that time and all
other individual copies of the Qur’an were burned with the order of the third caliph.
The same authentic Qur’an exists today, which does not differ even slightly from its
ﬁrst original copy.

In contrast to the Qur’an, the writing of ahadith of the Prophet occurred in a
different way. During the early period of prophethood of the Prophet, nobody was
allowed to write them down because there was a fear of mixing them up with the
Qur’an. However, during the later period of his life, the Prophet allowed some of his
companions to write some of his ahadith. Following his departure from this world,
his righteous caliphs were very cautious in accepting his ahadith from his compa-
nions. For instance, the ﬁrst caliph never accepted any hadith without verifying it
through the acknowledgement of at least two companions of the Prophet. Thus,
hadith study during early Islam mostly depended on oral narration and memoriza-
tion. When the righteous caliph U` mar ibn A` bd al-A` ziz ordered scholars to collect
and write all available ahadith of the Prophet, hadith collectors followed strict
conditions and rules in order to accept any hadith from any Muslim. In order to
enhance the authenticity of ahadith, an independent discipline called science of
al-Jarh and al-Ta`dil was introduced by these hadith scholars.

Thus, early Muslims knew the authenticity of the texts, which was closely
related to copyright, more than one thousand years ago. Following the collection of
ahadith, Muslim scholars started writing books on different disciplines of Islamic
science and on other ﬁelds of knowledge. The copyright of the author at that time
was less important than it is today because there were no printing machines. Copies
of a book were handwritten by scribes, which was so laborious a job that to some
extent it was more expensive than the writing itself. Yet, some classical scholars
thought about copyright. Probably the ﬁrst scholar who provoked the idea of
copyright among Muslims through criticizing plagiarism of Arabic poetry was Ibn
Salam.5 Also, Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti had written a book entitled Al-Fariq bayn al-
Musannif wa al-Sariq (Differentiator Between an Author and a Thief), in which the
author gave some idea about the copyright of an author.

During modern times, after the invention of the printing machine, the idea of
copyright of an author became popular. In order to protect this right, some

302

r  r Author’s Copyright

Muhammad Amanullah

European governments introduced legal rulings. Because books and other written
materials are easily circulated among nations and countries, the rulings regarding
this right should therefore be of an international nature. Among the ﬁrst interna-
tional treaties to protect copyright was the Berne Convention of 1886. This treaty
has been modiﬁed several times during the twentieth century.6 A number of
countries joined this treaty. Different international bodies also made many other
international treaties regarding copyright of authors. Nowadays, many Muslim
countries, including Arab ones, are members of these international organizations.
By virtue of these treaties, these Muslim countries have legal rulings regarding
copyright, which are almost identical to those of western countries. Contemporary
Muslim jurists have been trying to have Islamic justiﬁcation for these rulings
through their ijtihad and writings on the topic. This article discusses some sub-
topics of this main topic. The ﬁrst sub-topic is whether an author has the right to
have monetary compensation for his work.

Whether an author has the right to have monetary compensation
for his work

Muslim jurists are divided into two groups on whether an author has the right to
have monetary compensation for his work or not. The ﬁrst group maintains that an
author has no right to have monetary compensation for his work; rather, he should
conduct his job free of charge. The second group opines that an author has the right
to have monetary compensation for his work. This section of the article discusses
the arguments of both groups and, based on the work of some contemporary jurists,
tries to give preference to one of these two opinions over the other.

Opponents of compensation for an author

The ﬁrst group, who opposes the compensation for an author, comprises early
Hanaﬁ scholars and imam al-Qaraﬁ of the classical period, and Taqi al-Din
al-Nabahani and some others of modern time. Arguments of this group are as
follows:

1. Something is not considered to be wealth (mal) except if two components exist
in it, i.e. the possibility of possessing it and the possibility of getting material
beneﬁt out of it. As knowledge is an immaterial thing, it neither could be
possessed nor could have any material beneﬁt. Therefore, knowledge is not
wealth, for which no monetary compensation should be allowed.7

2. Accepting monetary compensation for writing a book and for permitting others
to use and copy it leads to the concealment of knowledge, which is forbidden in
Islam.8 A hadith quoted by A` bd al-Sami’ A` bd al-Wahhab supports this
argument. The hadith is: ‘‘The Messenger says: ‘The one who conceals knowl-
edge would appear on the Day of resurrection as reined in a bridle of ﬁre’ ’’.9
3. Acquiring and spreading knowledge are considered to be acts of proximity to
and obedience to Allah, not acts of business and trade. Receiving wages or

r  r 303

Muhammad Amanullah

Author’s Copyright

compensation for acts done to achieve proximity to Allah, therefore, is not
allowed.10

4. The right of an author is just like the right of pre-emption (al-shuf`a`h). Because
the right of pre-emption is free from any monetary claim (haqq mujarrad), the
right of an author should also be free from any monetary beneﬁt.11
If someone sells a book to another person, the former makes the latter or
purchaser the owner of all parts of this book. Therefore, this purchaser is
allowed to deal with it as he wishes to do so. Likewise, he is allowed to copy or
print it. The seller has no right to prevent the buyer from doing so.12

5.

6. The one who prints or makes a copy of a book does not cause a real loss to the
author. Rather, at most he reduces the proﬁt of the author. Reduction of proﬁt
is not equal to loss.13

7. Reserving the copyright for the author reduces circulation of the book. If
everybody has the right to print and distribute a book, its circulation would be
wider and the beneﬁt would be more comprehensive.14

Supporters of compensation for an author

The second group, who supports the compensation for an author, comprises most
classical jurists, including Shaﬁı` s, Malikis, Hanbalis and later Hanaﬁs, and most
modern jurists. The most important arguments of this group are as follows:

1.

Immaterial things, such as writing books, are considered a kind of innovation,
which has monetary value because it has beneﬁts. All these aspects that have
beneﬁts, according to most jurists, are considered to be wealth. Therefore,
receiving compensation for writing books is allowed.15 A hadith quoted by
Muhammad Taqi al-Din al-U` thmani also supports this argument. The hadith
is: ‘‘The Prophet says: ‘The one who does something before any other Muslim
does it belongs to him’ ’’.16

2. The Prophet had made the teaching of some verses of the Qur’an as a dowry of
a bride, although it was well known that the dowry should be a valuable wealth.
This practice of the Prophet, therefore, proves that teaching could be compen-
sated by wealth. Hence, teaching through a written book should also be allowed
to be compensated for by money.17 The Prophet says: ‘‘The most rightful
among the wages that you take from something is the wage that you take from
the Book of Allah’’.18 Receiving a wage for the Qur’an comes from teaching it
and from spreading its knowledge to others. If a person is allowed to receive a
wage for teaching the Qur’an, an author should also be allowed to receive
monetary compensation for his work because his work is harder than the work
of a teacher of the Qur’an.19

3. General custom (U` rf A`m) recognizes the copyright of an author as an aspect
that could be exchanged or compensated. According to this custom, the
copyright, therefore, is considered to be wealth. The basis of this custom is

304

r  r Author’s Copyright

Muhammad Amanullah

4.

public interest (maslahah mursalah), which is considered to be a secondary
source of legislation in Islam.20
Justice demands that the copyright should be ascribed to the author, and
plagiarism and relating an idea to other than its owner, who would beneﬁt from
it, should be forbidden.21

5. An author is like a skilled professional (sunna`) and his writing is his product.
Because every skilled professional owns the right of ownership of his product,
an author should also own the copyright of his writing. Likewise, because every
skilled professional is free to allow others to beneﬁt from his product with or
without payment, an author should also be free to allow others to beneﬁt from
his writings with or without payment.22

6. Ascribing the copyright of a book to its author encourages him to do more
research and investigation and to publish more of the results and ﬁndings of his
study, which leads the ummah to its advancement in the ﬁeld of knowledge. To
the contrary, denial of the copyright for the author would leave negative effects
in his mind and on knowledge related movement of the society to which he
belongs.23

7. The Qur’an and Sunnah of the Prophet contain many texts that encourage the
seeking and spreading of useful knowledge among the public. The opinion of
the legality of exchanging copyright with wealth does not contradict any of
these texts. Therefore, an author has the right to demand monetary compensa-
tion for his copyright.24

8. Any scientiﬁc research requires expenses for collecting sources, conducting ﬁeld
studies, typing, printing, etc. Moreover, the researcher might need free time to
carry out his research, which might hamper his obligation towards his family.
Because of all this, a researcher requires ﬁnancial assistance besides what he
would get as some return for his work.25

Analysis of the arguments

The arguments of the opponents are not strong enough to support their view
because, although knowledge itself is not a material being once it is collected in a
book, this book becomes a material being, which is possible to be owned by anyone
and, if it is sold, monetary beneﬁt comes out of it. Likewise, accepting monetary
compensation has nothing to do with concealing knowledge because both the
spreading of it and receiving money for it could happen together, without any
contradiction between the two. Moreover, later scholars have considered receiving
money for the act of worship lawful. For instance, receiving a salary for being an
imam of the ﬁve times daily prayers is allowed. Therefore, receiving money for
books should also be allowed. The right of pre-emption and copyright cannot be
equal because once a book is published, the author owns it as a material being,
while in pre-emption there is no ownership. Although a purchaser becomes the
owner of a purchased book according to customary practice, he does not own the

r  r 305

Muhammad Amanullah

Author’s Copyright

idea of the author. Therefore, the purchaser should not be allowed to handle this
book as he wishes. Rather, he should follow some rules. If only one copy is printed
for personal use, it does not harm the author that much, but if many copies of the
book were printed for the purpose of business, this action, beyond any doubt,
would harm the right of the author.

On the other hand, most of the arguments of the supporters are practical and
many of them are enhanced by the texts. Hence, these arguments cannot be nulliﬁed
easily. Therefore, works of an author, according to Islam, are considered as
material and immaterial, for which he is allowed to receive monetary beneﬁt and
compensation. His copyright, therefore, should be reserved for him.

Conditions for the protection of copyright

An author has no right to reserve the copyright of his book for himself unless he
fulﬁls a number of conditions. The most important of these conditions are as
follows:

1. An author should have some contribution to the ﬁeld of knowledge. The most
important contribution is to invent something new, which was not done by
anyone before him. In the ﬁeld of Islamic Fiqh it could be materialized through
ijtihad. In the ﬁelds of natural sciences it could occur through discovering a new
useful thing or idea.

2. His contribution should not harm the public or should not lead them to the

wrong path. Rather, it should be beneﬁcial for them.

3. His writing should be published or ready for publication. If it remains an idea
without jotting it down in written form, it would not receive any protection of
copyright.

4. The author should accomplish all necessary procedures, such as writing ‘‘All
rights reserved’’ on the cover page of his book, registering his book with the
registering authority, etc.26

If an author fulﬁls these conditions, according to western standards, he would
be entitled to receive his copyright protection during his lifetime and at most
50 years after his death for his heirs. However, in Islam, this right would remain
valid for the author during his lifetime and after his death for 60 years for his heirs.
Muslim jurists have determined this ruling through an analogical deduction, i.e.
because an endowed land is allowed to be given as lease for developing for a
maximum of 60 years, the copyright protection should also remain for the heir of
the author for 60 years.27

Plagiarism versus permitted quotation

Plagiarism is divided into several categories as follows:

1. The most important type of plagiarism is to publish a complete published book
under the name of an author who is not the real author. Sometimes publishers

306

r  r Author’s Copyright

Muhammad Amanullah

commit this crime by publishing a book under the name of a well-known author
in order to publicize a particular book to the public.

2. The less offensive crime is to publish parts of a published book, without
mentioning the name of its real author, under the name of another author who
has written a book and incorporated some chapters or paragraphs from the
other book. This type of plagiarism is widespread all over the world.

3. Plagiarism could also occur through translation of a published book without
referring to its author and instead putting the name of the translator as the
author.

All these categories of plagiarism are prohibited in Islam because a number of

arguments support this prohibition as follows:

A. Allah says: ‘‘Don’t eat your property among yourselves in a wrongful way’’.28
All these categories of plagiarism lead to eating or receiving the wealth of
others without having any legal justiﬁcation for it.

C.

B. The Prophet says: ‘‘Harm neither should be inﬂicted nor should be recipro-
cated’’.29 If anyone commits any type of the above plagiarism, he inﬂicts harm
to the author of that particular book. All these types of plagiarism, therefore,
should be forbidden.
In another hadith the Prophet says: ‘‘The one who acquires an amount of one
span of the hand (shibr) of land oppressively, Allah would make this land a
necklace for him on the Day of Judgment, which would be as big as seven
earths’’.30 As violation of the right of the owner of this land would cause this
punishment, violation of the copyright of an author would also cause a severe
punishment on the Day of Judgment. Violation of this right through different
types of plagiarism, therefore, should be forbidden.

D. The Prophet also states:

‘‘You should provide mutual advices regarding
knowledge because deception of anyone of you in his knowledge is more
serious than his deception in his wealth’’. According to this hadith, deception in
knowledge is haram. Because plagiarism is a kind of deception, it should also
be haram.31

However, appropriate and legal citation and quotation should not be forbidden
like the above plagiarism. The Muslim ummah unanimously agree that this type of
quotation is allowed. Some non-Prophetic tradition says: ‘‘Blessings for knowledge
could be achieved through referring it to its originator’’. The permitted quotations
should follow some rules, such as it should be put within parenthesis, it should be
referred to its author and his book appropriately, its amount should be reasonable
and not too lengthy in a single quotation, and it should be quoted correctly.32
According to some scholars, all citations of 15 words or more should be properly
acknowledged.33 If these rules are not followed, the quotations will be illegal and a
type of plagiarism.

Muhammad Amanullah

Author’s Copyright

Copying or printing a published book without the permission of its author

Copying or printing a published book could be either for business purposes or for
personal use. The ﬁrst category is usually conducted with the permission of the
author. However, if this is done without the permission of the author, according to
a strong and preferable opinion, this is considered forbidden because a number of
verses of the Qur’an and ahadith of the Prophet mentioned above prove that this is
considered to be a hostile act against the right of the author.

Contemporary scholars do not discuss elaborately the issue of copying or
printing a copy of a whole book or parts of it for personal use. Most of them discuss
the issue of printing without the permission of the author in a way that makes it
seem to the reader that they do not differentiate between printing for the purpose of
business and personal use. Both of them should be forbidden according to them.
However, the issue of printing for personal use is so important that it should receive
particular attention from contemporary authors on copyright of writers. First, the
reasons why printing of books or articles occurs for personal use will be highlighted.
Then suggestions will be made on the ruling of the Sharı`ah for it.

The following reasons and circumstances could be mentioned for the printing

of books for personal use:

1. Some publishers ﬁx such high prices for their published books that they cannot
be afforded by poor people or even the middle class. In order to fulﬁl their
desire to acquire knowledge, these people ﬁnd a cheaper way of owning these
books. One of these ways is to copy it by means of a photocopy machine.

2. Some people want to establish their personal library with their limited income.
Once they ﬁnd that their budget does not cover the price of the books that they
would like to collect, they try to own them by means of copying them.

3. Researchers who frequently conduct research projects require scores of sources
at once to accomplish their job on time before the submission deadline. It is not
easy for them to ﬁnd the addresses of all the authors in order to contact them to
gain permission. If some of the addresses are found and contact is made to the
concerned authors, there is no guaranty of receiving the reply quickly.
Additionally, there is a great chance that thousands of researchers all over
the world at once might need the same source for their own research projects. If
all of them seek the permission of a particular author at least once a year, this is
a great burden for the author, who would most probably fail to answer them.
Thus, the seeking of knowledge and its circulation among the public would be
tremendously hampered.
It has become a well-known trend all over the world to organize international,
national and local conferences frequently on different types of topics that are
very important for all humankind. Scholars from all parts of the world are
invited to participate and present their papers in these seminars. Sometimes the
deadlines for submitting abstracts and full papers are so close that the
researchers require accomplishment of their jobs quickly, for which they have

4.

308

r  r Author’s Copyright

Muhammad Amanullah

no time to receive the permission of scores of authors who might reply to them
or might not. In these circumstances, these researchers have no other option but
to make quick copies of these materials.

5. Thousands of higher learning institutions operate all over the world. A large
number of lecturers teach millions of students in these institutions. The libraries
of most of these institutions are so poor that they do not have the capacity to
purchase many copies of each required and important book. Most of these
institutions, therefore, survive with a limited number of each required source.
The lecturers need these sources to prepare their courses; students need them to
read for their courses and to write assignments for each lecturer who teaches
them; and researchers need them for their research. All these demands
continuously change and increase. The above activities go on every day all
over the world within the boundaries of these institutions. It is hardly feasible
for all these different quarters to seek permission from each author, who might
reply on time or might not do so at all. In order to deal with this practical
situation, the people mentioned above follow an easy step, i.e. they copy
necessary books and materials, as they are required for their study, research,
teaching, etc.

In light of these circumstances, it is suggested that students of higher learning,
lecturers and researchers should ﬁrst try to buy the required materials. If they are
unable to buy it easily, they should try to receive the permission of the authors, if
the permission could be received easily and within a reasonable period of time. If
they fail to do so, or if the amount of copied materials is reasonable and necessary
for their study, research and teaching, they should be allowed to copy them without
prior permission of the authors. Likewise, educational institutes should have the
authority to copy urgently required books for lecturers and students without the
permission of the authors. If this is not allowed, the necessary activities mentioned
above will be tremendously hampered. The Prophet says: ‘‘Harm neither should be
inﬂicted nor should be reciprocated’’. According to this hadith, authors should not
have the right to prevent individuals from copying certain pages of their books to
fulﬁl urgent needs. Likewise, the Prophet commended Muslims to convey and
spread knowledge to others. He says: ‘‘Convey from me even if it is only a single
verse’’. Hindering the above people from copying urgently required materials would
hamper the spread of knowledge as such.

The Egyptian law of 1954 regarding copyright, therefore, had taken the
decision to allow people to make one copy of each book for their personal use.34
This law goes too far against the interest of the authors. Hence, there should be
some regulations and restrictions as mentioned in the above paragraph. Likewise,
the laws of United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Tunis, Morocco and Algeria allow
educational institutions to copy any book without the permission of the author.35
The laws of these countries are also against the interest of the authors. Therefore,
some restrictions mentioned above should be applied.
