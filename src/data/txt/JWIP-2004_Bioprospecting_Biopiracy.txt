INTRODUCTION 

In the period between the 1994 conclusion of the negotiation for the Agreement 
on  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  (TRIPS) during  the  Uruguay 
Round and the convening of the Doha Ministerial Meeting in 2001, the question of 
assigning  property  rights  to  traditional  knowledge  and  folklore  had  become  a 
sufficiently  contentious  international  issue  that  it  was  included  in  the  work 
programme  of the  Doha  Development  Round. The reason  for  the  increase in  the 
profile  of  these  issues  lies,  to  a  considerable degree,  in  the  progress  made  in  the 
research,  development  and  commercialization  of  biotechnology-based  products.2 
Essentially, the  enhanced commercial value of genetic material made possible by the 
techniques and procedures of modern biotechnology  can only be  captured through 
either  legal  controls,  such  as  intellectual  property  rights,  or  through  biologcal 
controls,  such as  gene  suppression techniques  (Gaisford et  al.,  2OOl).3  The former 
controls have come to dominate genetic research for two reasons. First, there has been 
a  significant  lack  of  support  for  using  gene  suppression  techniques  to  control 
commercial  value  because  of  concerns  about  “corporate  control”  over  living

organisms. As  a result, none of these techniques are currently in use and the prospects 
for their future use at present look bleak. 

Second, the advent of modern biotechnology coincided with many governments 
retreating from public research due to rising public-sector  deficits and debt servicing 
loads  (Boyd  et  al.,  2003).  As  governments  reduced  their  expenditures,  private 
researchers were willing to fd the void only if they could appropriate the commercial 
value of their research through intellectual property rights (Klein and Kerr, 1995). To 
achieve this, the previously limited ability to claim intellectual property rights in living 
organisms was extended (Gaisford et at.,  2001). 

Of course, this increased use of intellectual property rights in genetic research was 
a  major  departure from  how  genetic material was  managed  prior  to  the  advent  of 
modern biotechnology. Due in part to the non-excludable  nature of living organisms, 
genetic material was traditionally considered as global common property derived from 
generations of accumulated traditional knowledge such that no single innovator could 
be  easily identified. As  a  result, much  genetic research was  undertaken in  the  public 
sector and distributed as a public good. 

the

Genetic  research 

techniques  and  procedures  of  modern 
biotechnology departed from this historical trajectory because it was now much easier 
to identify the innovator, the one employing the new techniques and procedures. The 
broadening  of  intellectual  property  rights  in  modern  biotechnology  followed  the 
norms  of  intellectual  property  rights  protection  concentrating  on  novelty  and 
incentives for innovation. No account, however, was taken of traditional knowledge, 
despite the  fact  that  traditional knowledge  often  has  an  essential part  to  play  in  the 
progress of modern  biotechnology by,  for example, pointing  the way to plants with 
desirable properties. 

In  practical terms,  as  a  global  common  good,  traditional  knowledge is  deemed 
ineligible for  intellectual property protection,  while  contemporary  and  sophisticated 
scientific knowledge is deemed a novel, inventive step eligible for intellectual property 
protection. As  a  result, the  techniques and  procedures of modern  biotechnology are 
often  applied  to  traditional knowledge in  order  to  isolate  and  extract  the  beneficial 
characteristics  useful  in  the  development  of  nutraceutical  (functional  foods  and 
supplements with  enhanced  nutritional  composition)  or  plant-based  pharmaceutical 
products that are then  eligible for intellectual property protection  and the monopoly 
rents that accrue. 

Some  view  this  activity  as  “bioprospecting”-a 

necessary  component  of 
innovation. For example, biotechnology firms consider bioprospecting to be  a search 
for organisms with commercially desirable traits in order to bring human health benefits 
to  all  and not just  those fortunate enough  to benefit from the  traditional knowledge 
because they live in a particular geographic or cultural zone. 

BIOPROSPECTING OR BIOPIRACY? 

37 

Others view this activity as “biopiracy”-essentially 

a theft of valuable resources for 
the commercial gain of developed countries and multinational corporations. To those 
with  this  view,  biopiracy  represents  a  &singenuous  repackaging  of  traditional 
knowledge in  order  to  secure monopoly  rents for the  biopirate while excluding the 
original innovator from a claim to these rents. The fact that the potential returns from 
investing in modern biotechnology accrue only to those who hold intellectual property 
rights biased in favour of modern biotechnology and against tradtional knowledge raises 
sig.ruficant inequity concerns. After all, much of the world’s  traditional knowledge of 
biodiversity is held by those among the world’s poorest (Ken and Yampoin, 2000). 

With these two very different perspectives, it should come as no surprise that the 
debates around genetic resources, intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge 
have  become  quite  polarized; proponents  of bioprospecting generally  argue  that  all 
genetic material should be subject to  intellectual property protection while critics of 
biopiracy  generally  argue  that  no  genetic  material  should be  subject  to  intellectual 
property protection. 

The objective of this  article is  to  examine  the  bioprospecting-biopiracy  debate 
with  a  view  to  providmg  a  structure for  the  international protection  of intellectual 
property rights that maximizes the potential for both traditional knowledge and modern 
scientific innovation to contribute to economic progress. The conclusion suggests that 
neither  polar  position-complete 
protection  versus  no  protection  for  traditional 
knowledge-is 
optimal.  Instead, there  exist  conditional circumstances for  extending 
protection  to  traditional  knowledge  that  have  the  advantage  of  simultaneously 
enhancing the contribution of both traditional and modem sources of knowledge. 

11.  BIOTECHNOLOGY, TRADITIONAL 

KNOWLEDGE AND  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

One  of  the  major  uses  of  modern  biotechnology  is  in  genetic  modification 
whereby  modern  techniques  of  genetic  enhancement  are  used  to  alter  biological 
organisms  beyond  that  which  is  attainable  using  natural  selection  and  controlled 
breedmg.  Gene  mapping  creates  a  base  of  knowledge  that  can  be  used  in  the 
identification of genetic material that  has  attributes with  potential commercial value; 
genetic  modification  makes  it  possible  to  realize  that  potential  commercial  value 
through the creation of products with desirable traits. Thus, biotechnology is one of the 
main pillars of the knowledge economy that most developed countries see as the key to 
their future relative prosperity and has  become  the focus of many  national industrial 
policies (Isaac, 2002). 

In  its  first  decade  of  commercialization,  the  biotechnology  industry  has  been 
dominated  by  products  whose  benefits  lie  primarily  in  attributes that  enhance  the 
agronomic performance of plants-meaning 
that  direct benefits  accrue primarily  to 
agricultural producers and, of course, the commercial crop developers. The dominance 

38

of  these  production-trait  genetically modified  (GM) crops  is  expected  to  decline, 
however, as plant developers increasingly focus on output-trait  GM crops that exhibit 
characteristics  of  value  to  the  end  consumer  (Isaac,  2002).  The  targets  include 
nutraceuticals and  plant-made  pharmaceuticals  (PMPS) that  use  plant  photosynthesis 
instead  of  the  current  methods  of  chemical  synthesis.  The  global  market  for 
nutraceuticals has been valued at US$ 140 bdion with an expected annual growth rate 
of between 5 and  10 percent for the next decade, driven by  an increased demand for 
“alternative”  and  “natural” products  (Nutrition  Business Journal,  2001). The global 
market for pharmaceuticals has been valued at US$410 bilhon with an expected growth 
rate of between 7 and 8 percent over the next five years. 

in 

Tradtional knowledge plays an important role in identifying genetic material with 
beneficial characteristics that can be isolated and extracted from the original organism 
and  used 
the  development  of  novel  products  such  as  nutraceuticals  or 
pharmaceuticals. At  first  glance,  there  appears to  be  a  real  economic  development 
opportunity for traditional knowledge holders to link with functional food and  drug 
companies in order to access the large and growing global markets for nutraceuticals and 
pharmaceuticals.  However,  this  opportunity  is  limited  by  the  rules  pertaining  to 
intellectual property rights embodied in the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS 
Agreement. For the most part, these rules promote knowledge-creation and innovation 
on a global scale where knowledge and innovation are defined in terms of sophisticated 
scientific procedures and techniques rather than traditional knowledge. Consequently, 
the holders of traditional knowledge are effectively shut out of the knowledge economy. 
Further, a sub-optimal rate of innovation in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals will be 
observed, and biotechnology will not live up to its full potential. 

111.  CASE STUDY: PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES 

Beyond  the  substantial  commercial  potential  of  biotechnology,  plant  genetic 
resources have been chosen as an illustrative example of the complicated relationship 
between intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge because they embody a 
panoply of concerns about the scientific modification of nature (and the human, animal 
and  biodiversity impacts  of  such modifications)  and  about  the  control  over  natural 
resources (for both food and pharmaceutical use) by  multinational corporations (Low, 
2001; Shiva, 1999; van Wijk et al.,  1993). That is, examining the relationship between 
intellectual property  rights  and  traditional  knowledge  with  respect  to  plant  genetic 
resources provides a broad-based  assessment of these sensitive topics. 

“Land races” of plants refers to  the  staple crops, such as  wheat,  rice  and maize, 
modified  over  thousands  of  years  through  the  inter-generational  accumulation  of 
traditional  knowledge  (and  which  now  may  have  been  moddied  over  perhaps  a 
hundred years through the use of scientific knowledge) in order to express quantity and

quahty characteristics valuable for human use. Much has  also been learned about the 
medicinal properties of naturally occurring plants. Despite the accumulated knowledge, 
it has been estimated that less than 0.1 percent of all plants have been assessed for their 
beneficial properties. Given the  enhanced abhty to identitjr and isolate economically 
useful genetic material that  underlies biotechnology, there  is  currently an  aggressive 
search for these plants and the new benefits they may yield. 

As  discussed  above,  traditionally  plants-and, 

consequently,  their  genetic 
material-have  been considered as “global common goods” provided by nature for the 
benefit of all  such that  ownership could not  be  assigned  to  any individual or group, 
implying that  no  one  could secure intellectual property  rights  over  the  plants.  This 
designation has facrlitated their international movement, which has taken place since the 
dawn of commerce &err  and Yampoin, 2000; Gokn, 1998). Increasingly, however, the 
definition of plants  as  global common goods  has  been  blurred in  order  to promote 
innovation in plant development. That is, naturally occurring plants themselves are still 
considered global common goods, but identifying the genetic sequences coding for the 
particular proteins that provide the desired benefit  is  considered to be an intellectual 
endeavour eligible for intellectual property protection. Understandmg this distinction 
requires  specification  of  knowledge  and  of  intellectual  property  rights,  which  are 
examined in what follows. 

At  the  heart  of the  conflict between  intellectual property  rights and  traditional 
knowledge  are  differing  definitions  of  what  constitutes  knowledge  eligble  for 
protection. To capture the range of these differing definitions, three classifications might 
be considered 

the source of the knowledge; 
the type of knowledge; and 
the furnisher of the knowledge. 

A. 
B. 
C. 
These  classifications  are, however,  inexorably linked  in  the  process  of  defining 

what is eligible for protection as intellectual property. 

A.  The Source ofthe Knowledge 

The source of the  knowledge  can  be  either  Western  scientific procedures and 
techniques or tradltional knowledge. In the case  of plant genetic resources, traditional 
knowledge would refer to the accumulated learning-ften 
that has enabled certain peoples to know, for instance, that a particular plant, harvested 
under particular conditions and processed in a particular way, provides a remedy for a 
particular ailment. Due  to  the  accumulated inter-generational nature of the  learning 
process, ownership of the knowledge and the benefits that it brings are not given to any 
one  individual but  instead are  shared  as  ‘‘common goods”. Scientific k n o w l e d g e  

across many generations- 

40 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

which emerges from the foundation of the accumulated, inter-generational tradtional 
knowledge-nevertheless  differs from traditional knowledge in a key respect. Scientific 
knowledge  tends  to  explore beyond  the  serenchpity of the  traditional knowledge to 
understand both  why  and  how  a particular plant  provides  a  remedy for  a  particular 
ailment. The sophisticated techniques  and procedures that  comprise modern  genetic 
sciences play an increasingly important role in this investigation. 

B.  The Type ofKnowledge 

The  distinction between  traditional  and  scientific knowledge  gives  rise  to  the 
second important classification-the 
type of knowledge. In this case, two distinct types 
arise: discoveries and inventions. The former are outcomes of nature that do not require 
a human intervention while the latter are those outcomes that are not possible without 
a human intervention. For example, it can be argued that the traditional knowledge of 
the  benefits  of  a  particular  plant  is  a  discovery  because  there  was  no  real  human 
intervention required to extract the benefit from the plant; the benefit was always there 
and the human intervention only maximized the beneficial characteristic. On the other 
hand, the scientific knowledge of how and why the plant provides the benefit that it 
does is  not possible without a human intervention  in the form of highly sophisticated 
scientific procedures  and techniques. Moreover,  extracting the beneficial aspects  and 
incorporating them into a product certainly requires human intervention. 

Hence, under  these  definitions, traditional knowledge is  considered a  discovery, 

while a product emerging from scientific knowledge is an invention. 

C.  The Furnisher oftke Knowledge 

In the third classification, it is important to identify who furnishes the knowledge. 
In the example above, the primary/original innovators are the indigenous societies that 
accumulated the knowledge inter-generationally. Certainly, it is undeniable that some 
innovation has occurred in the form of identifjing the plant and the conditions under 
which the plant has beneficial properties for particular ailments. Assigning “ownership” 
to the primary/original innovator is, however, very difficult. Of course, this problem 
disappears if the traditional knowledge is considered to be common property. On the 
other hand, the secondary innovator-extending  and refining the traditional knowledge 
through the use of sophisticated scientific techniques and procedures in order to develop 
a  product-is  much  easier  to  identify.  Moreover,  if  the  use  of  modern  science  is 
considered to be a human intervention, then the secondary innovator is the one actually 
providing an invention-beyond 

simply being a discovery. 

The  reason  why  intellectual  property  rights  are  not  typically  extended  to 
chscoveries in property rights legislation lies in the particular hnction the rights serve in 

BIOPROSPECTING OR BIOPIRACY? 

41 

the economy. In modem market economies, intellectual property rights are granted for 
one primary purpose:  to  encourage investments or activity in  that  particular  area  of 
economic endeavour, whether that is creative activities in the arts or letters, the pursuit 
of products of high and identifiable quality, or investment in trend-breaking industrial 
designs. In the case  of biotechnology, innovation is  the objective and patents are the 
instrument  used  to  extend  protection  to  intellectual property.  Patents  are  meant  to 
correct a market failure. The market failure leads to sub-optimal levels of investment in 
innovative activities and arises because producers that  can use  an innovation without 
incurring research and development costs will always have a competitive advantage over 
firms that  innovate and  incur  those  costs. As  a  result,  there wdI be  no  incentive  to 
innovate. 

Patents reward innovators with a temporary monopoly on the intellectual property 
that  they  have  created.  In  modern  market  economies it  is  well understood that  the 
granting of a monopoly creates a market failure of its  own-higher 
prices and lower 
quantity of output.4 There is an implicit belief that the temporary inefficiency loss from 
the granting of the monopoly is  outweighed, on average, by  the benefits arising from 
innovation.  Thus,  one  can  see  the  innovation  focus  of  the  granting of  intellectual 
property  rights.  Further,  the  patent  holder  is  required  to  disclose  the  scientific 
knowledge that underlies the innovation to the public in order to promote knowledge 
dissemination. Malung  the  scientific information  available  instead  of  allowing  it  to 
remain proprietary has the objective of reducing information costs for other innovators.5 
The  underlying  cause  of  the  market  failure  lies  in  the  public-good  nature  of 
knowledge whereby once created it is impossible-or 
exclude others 
from its  use  in  the private market  and that  its  “consumption” by  one user  does not 
preclude  its  consumption  by  another.  According to  this  view  of  the  protection  of 
intellectual property rights, knowledge, including discoveries, should be a public good. 
It is  only when  the market failure associated  with  under-investment  in innovation is 
manifest  that  the  extension  of  intellectual  property  rights  is justified.  There  is  no 
“equity” justification for granting intellectual property rights. 

very costly-to 

Iv.  CONTROVERSY IN INTERNATIONAL  INSTITUTIONS 

Under international intellectual property conventions, intellectual property rights 
for plant genetic resources have typically been gven for Western science inventions by 
a  secondary innovator rather than for  traditional discoveries by  the primary/original 
innovator. This is  consistent with  the innovation focus of intellectual property rights. 
This  has  given  rise  to  bioprospecting whereby  scientists  can  extract  plant  genetic 
resources from the primary innovators/traditional users because land races and natural 

4  This yields a “dead weight loss”, in economists’ terms. 
5  The economic arguments pertaining to intellectual property rights and innovation can be found in Machlup, 

1958; Nordhaus, 1969; Gallini, 1992; Comelli and Schankennan, 1999. 

42 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

plants are considered global common goods, and subsequently extend  and refine the 
traditional knowledge using modem science, and claim an invention which is eligible 
for intellectual property protection. Moreover, supporters of these rules argue that all 
genetic material to which  the  inventive step of scientific knowledge has  been  added 
should be eligible for protection. 

Yet, critics of the current relationship between intellectual property rights and plant 
genetic  resources  argue  that  this  is  simply  biopiracy,  where  the  role  of  human 
intervention in  determining that  a particular plant, harvested at a  particular time and 
processed  in  a  particular  manner,  has  desirable  characteristics  is  discounted  as  an 
innovation and simply labelled as a discovery. It is argued that the role of modern science 
is  elevated such that identifying a  gene sequence using procedures and techniques of 
modern  biotechnology is patentable because  of  the  human  intervention  required to 
identify the sequence despite the fact that, in the most pragmatic sense, identifying this 
sequence is not an invention; it is only a discovery of a genetic resource that has always 
existed, albeit at a more micro-level than previously observed. The result is the argument 
that intellectual property rights should not be allowed for plant genetic resources at all- 
regardless of whether the source of the knowledge is traditional or scientific. 

Given  the  contentious  nature  of  the  issues  surroundmg  intellectual  property 
protection  for  plant  genetic  resources,  it  is  useful  to  attempt  to  disentangle  the 
complicated arguments for  and  against their  use.  The arguments are  summarized in 
Table  I-the  Tableau of Alternatives-which  may  be  read  vertically  down  the  five 
columns,  and  are  specified  with  respect  to  the  rationale  of  the  argument  and  an 
assessment of the benefits and costs of the various positions. 

A,  Three Distinct Market Failures 

The  arguments  for  and  against  extending  intellectual  property  rights  for  plant 
genetic resources fundamentally represent a  clash between  economic-efficiency-based 
and  social-equity-based  arguments.  The  former  posit  that  innovative  activities  that 
create knowledge face important classic market fdures that hinder allocative efficiency. 
Intellectual  property  rights  target  innovative  activities  (where  the  priority  is  often 
established by governments) and are structured to overcome market failures and inject 
greater allocative efficiency into the  market system. In fact, while the  classic  market 
failure arguments previously discussed are present, the issue of plant innovation gives rise 
to two more market failure arguments: geographic insularity and cultural excludability. 
The  former  is  the  fdure  that  occurs  when  a  plant  with  beneficial  human  health 
characteristics is  only  made  available  within  a  geographic  proximity  that  shares  the 
traditional knowledge. The market failure is that global human health cannot benefit. 
The market failure associated with cultural excludability occurs when the benefits 
accrue only to those who  share a  cultural proximity. The knowledge cannot be used

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

globally  to improve human health. Therefore, intellectual property rights are granted 
for  plant  genetic  resources not  simply to  correct  classic  market  failure  but  also  the 
failures that arise from geographic insularity and cultural excludability. This argument is 
predicated on the  notion  that without  an  assurance of protection,  firms w d  have  no 
incentive to innovate to create market-oriented products that overcome the  “classic” 
( i t .  free-rider  problem)  and  the  “specific”  (i.e.  geographic  insularity  and  cultural 
excludability) market failures. 

B.  Social Equity 

The market-efficiency-based arguments are generally seen to be in contrast to the 
social-equity-based arguments, which tend to view intellectual property rights as being 
predatory instruments of scientifically advanced countries that, in fact, create exclusions 
themselves. Namely, they exclude traditional knowledge, the primary innovator and the 
role of discovery from the monopoly economic rents. In the extreme, these arguments 
reject  the  granting of intellectual property  rights  on plant  genetic resources  entirely. 
These arguments will be examined first. 

C.  Intellectual Property Rights for  Plant  Genetic Resources Disallowed 

The  left-hand  column  of  Table  1 provides  an  assessment  of  the  argument  for 
disallowing any intellectual property rights for plant genetic resources. The rationale for 
this  argument  is  that  identifying the  beneficial properties  of  a  plant-either 
at  the 
holistic, traditional-knowledge  level or at the  more  precise genetic level of scientific 
knowledge-remains 
only  a  discovery of  a  global common  good,  not  an  invention 
worthy  of  intellectual  property.  That  is,  neither  the  primary  innovator  nor  the 
secondary innovator should be granted monopoly rights over the exclusive commercial 
marketing of the benefits. Further, from t h s  perspective, it is  argued that intellectual 
property rights  create an  economic  distortion in  the  form  of  a  “Western” scientific 
hurdle to innovation that cannot be overcome by many traditional innovators because 
they lack the technical capacity to engage in the activities of modern science. 

It  is  argued  that  the  benefit  of  denying  intellectual  property  to  plant  genetic 
resources is  equity-based; that  plant  genetic resources remain global  common  goods 
available  to  all  and  cannot  be  exclusively  controlled.  Without  an  ability  to  secure 
monopoly rights, it is argued that the incentive for predatory, rent-seeking  behaviour 
by those with the capacity to overcome the scientific hurdle will be eliminated. 

The costs  associated with  denying intellectual property  rights  are  rooted  in  the 
efficiency paradigm. Disallowing the possibility of securing intellectual property rights 
over plant genetic resources inhibits innovation by  not  overcoming the classic market 
failure  associated  with  free-riding  and  the  specific  market  failures  of  geographic 

BIOPROSPECTING  OR BIOPIRACY? 

45 

insularity and cultural excludability. It is  argued that the primary innovator often does 
not  have  the  capacity  to  transform  the  beneficial plant  into  a  commercial  product 
available  on  a  global  scale.  Yet,  without  the  assurance  of  protection  over  their 
intellectual investment in this transformation, secondary innovators would be reluctant 
to dedicate the resources required. The cost is the failure to bring to market products 
that  may  have  considerable  social  benefit,  even  accounting  for  the  costs  of  the 
monopoly  distortion.  Further,  it  would  seem  that  the  size  of  the  market  failures 
associated with the failure to make the benefits available  on a global basis  arising from 
either geographic insularity or cultural excludability would far outweigh losses arising 
from the inefficiency associated with monopoly. 

D. 

Intellectual  Property  Rights for  Plant  Genetic Resources Allowed 

While the arguments against allowing intellectual property rights over plant genetic 
resources tend to be very straightfonvard, the arguments supporting the  extension of 
intellectual property  rights  to  plant  genetic  resources are  much  more  complicated. 
There are two broad categories, “qualified protection” and “unconstrained protection”, 
where the former is itself sub-divided into three categories (see  Table  1). 

It should be noted that in each case the arguments share a focus on efficiency-based 
benefits through  correcting both  the classic market failures pertaining to  sub-optimal 
rates  of  innovation  and  the  market  failures  specific  to  plant-based  innovation, 
e.g.  geographic insularity and cultural excludability. Here the notion is that intellectual 
property  rights  over  plant  genetic  resources  promote  the  maximum  innovation  of 
plants, beyond what the primary innovator is willing or capable of doing. 

The arguments for only allowing quahfied intellectual property rights over plant 
genetic resources are all rooted in the premise that maximizing innovation is the ultimate 
goal. To accomplish this means that only some types of knowledge qualify for protection. 
Consider first the second column from the left in  Table  1, entitled “existing crops” or 
land races. As previously mentioned, land races refers to plants already modified for use 
as agricultural crops where innovations to these plants  target improvements to quantity 
and/or  quahty  characteristics  beyond  the  modifications  of  the  primary  innovator. 
Indeed, with most varieties of staple agricultural crops it is extremely difficult to identify 
a sole primary innovator. Therefore, some type of hurdle must be established to identify 
innovations that are worthy of protection as well as the innovators responsible for the 
innovation.  The  hurdle  that  has  emerged  is  one  of  scientific  definition,  where  an 
innovative improvement to a crop must arise from a sophisticated scientific technique or 
procedure.  That  is,  the  quWication  upon  which  intellectual property  protection  is 
granted to  plant  genetic resources is  that  the  innovation be  scientfiic in  nature. The 
rationale  is  that  the  use  of  advanced  science  results  in  crop  innovations  more  like 
inventions that are eligible for protection. The benefits, according to this argument, are 

46 

THE JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

that it promotes innovative improvements to crops already part of the agricultural system, 
and that the protection corrects both the classic market failure and the specific market 
fdures of cultural excludabdity and geographic insularity. 

The cost of this argument is that it essentially excludes the primary innovator from 
intellectual property protection if a satisfactory level of science is required to shift the 
innovation from a discovery to an invention. The primary innovator will also be subject 
to the prices associated with the monopoly distortion along with  all other consumers. 
Of course,  the  primary  innovator  would  only  choose  to  purchase  and  employ  the 
products of the scientific innovation if they were sufficiently superior to existing land 
races to offset the cost. 

Arguments for allowing intellectual property rights over plant genetic resources on 
a qualified basis involve not  only existing crops but uncultivated plants; plant varieties 
with either known or unknown beneficial properties that have not been systematically 
modified  for  human  use.  Consider  first  unimproved  plants  with  known  beneficial 
properties. This argument is very similar to the previous conditional argument on the 
protection of existing traditional crops. The rationale is that intellectual property rights 
are  necessary  to  promote  innovation  extending  the  traditional  knowledge  of  the 
beneficial attributes to others who may not have access to the traditional knowledge due 
to  cultural  excludabihty  or  geographc  insularity.  To  qualify  for  protection,  the 
secondary innovator must demonstrate an inventive step beyond the primary dxovery. 
Again,  the  inventive step is  best  demonstrated through  the  use  of modern  scientific 
techniques  and  procedures.  The  benefits  are  that  intellectual  property  protection 
promotes innovation thereby extendmg the access to the beneficial properties of these 
plants beyond what the primary innovator is capable or wiUlng to do. 

In terms of costs, thls argument for intellectual property protection differs fiom the 
examination of existing traditional crops because in many cases the primary innovator can 
be identified, or at least the primary innovators may be identifed. This raises the spectre 
of biopiracy,  whereby representatives of scientifically advanced secondary innovators use 
the  trahtional  knowledge  of  primary  innovators  to  identify  plants  in  the  natural 
environment with beneficial properties, extract the plants as global common goods, apply 
modern scienhfic techniques to identify why and how the plants work to alleviate ailments, 
patent this scientific knowledge and thus have monopoly rights over the commercial use 
of t h s  knowledge. Those who support the protection of intellectual property in these cases 
respond that  as  long as  the secondary innovator does not use  the  courts to prevent the 
primary innovator &om using the traditional knowledge in the tradtional way, then there 
is no harm to allowing protection, particularly given the benefits associated with removing 
the constraints of geographc insularity and cultural excludabihty. 

Now, consider plants found in nature with unknown beneficial properties. This is 
the  classic  case  of  bioprospecting  and  is  motivated  by  the  estimate  that  less  than 

BIOPROSPECTING OR BIOPIRACY? 

47 

0.1 percent of all plants have been assessed for their beneficial potential. The rationale 
for extending intellectual property rights is  that in order to  encourage innovators to 
discover  plants  with  immediate  benefits  and  to  invent  the  subsequent  large-scale 
derivative products, assurances that intellectual property investments will be protected 
are required. In this sense, to q u m  for intellectual property protection, the discovery 
and/or  invention  must be  novel.  The benefits  of this  argument are  that  intellectual 
property  rights  promote  frontier  exploration  for  new  products  and  processes  and 
prevent classic and specific market failures. Furthermore, there seems to be very little 
cost  to  this  argument.  Given  that  the  exploration is  for  plants  with  yet  unknown 
beneficial properties, there is no predation of the traditional knowledge of a primary 
innovator  by  a  secondary innovator  who  has  the  capacity  to  overcome  a  scientific 
hurdle and secure monopoly rights over the commercial use of the knowledge. 

Finally,  consider  the  argument  for  allowing  unqualified-”unconstrained”- 

intellectual property rights over plant genetic resources (summarized in the right-hand 
column  of  Table  1).  Ths  argument  differs  from  the  arguments  for  the  qualified 
extension of intellectual property rights because there is no distinction made between 
the  types  of  knowledge  that  quah@ for  protection.  Essentially,  all  discoveries  and 
inventions, whether  of trahtional knowledge or scientific knowledge, are eligible for 
intellectual property protection. The rationale is that uncondtional intellectual property 
protection over plant genetic resources does not  &scriminate between traditional and 
scientific knowledge,  treating  both  equally  and  providing  the  opportunity  for  the 
primary innovator  to profit  from the  traditional knowledge if  desired. Essentially, it 
allows all innovators to protect their knowledge and does not establish any arbitrary or 
exclusionary  hurdles  to  legitimate  protection.  Simdar  to  the  other  arguments  for 
allowing intellectual property rights over plant genetic resources, the efficiency-based 
benefit of this argument is that it promotes innovation by correcting the classic market 
failure and it overcomes the specific market failures of geographic insularity and cultural 
excludability. There is also an equity-based benefit with this argument: the eligbility of 
traditional knowledge discoveries under intellectual property protection. 

There are, however, three crucial costs to allowing the unconstrained protection 
of plant genetic resources. The first cost arises because this approach to the protection 
of intellectual property  rights  differs significantly from  the  spirit  and  intent  of the 
contemporary  intellectual property  rules and would  require  considerable and costly 
restructuring of national legislation and revamping of national institutions as well as 
re-negotiation  of international conventions and agreements. The second cost is  that 
this  argument  rejects  the  notion  of global common  goods  and instead  accepts that 
ownership can be assigned to  everything-discovery  or invention. The third cost is 
that simply granting ownership to the primary innovator does not imply that further 
innovation will occur. Indeed, the primary innovator may simply lack the capacity to 
develop  a  global scale product,  yet  a  secondary innovator  may not  be  interested in

investing  in  this  transformation  when  the  intellectual  property  resides  elsewhere. 
Alternatively, the secondary innovator may pay the primary innovator for the use  of 
his intellectual property, raising the cost of secondary innovation and, hence, reducing 
the  incentive  for  innovation  (Kerr  and  Yampoin,  2000).  Given  that  intellectual 
property  rights are  artificial constructs of government  put  in place  solely to induce 
innovation,  granting 
discovery  appears 
counterproductive.

v.  SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR  RESOLVING THE BIOPROSPECTING-BIOPIRACY DEBATE 
The arguments surrounding the  extension of intellectual property rights to plant 
genetic resources are complex. The question is  often approached from very polarized 
positions, but as Table 2 reveals, there are several important distinctions in the arguments 
for allowing protection. 

The  position  on  the  extension  of  intellectual  property  rights  to  plant  genetic 
resources that tends to be favoured by international intellectual property agreements is 
found in the middle three columns of Table 1. That is, international trade rules tend to 
impose a hurdle of protection eligibihty that supports scientific knowledge as creating 
inventions and  discounts traditional knowledge by  suggesting that  this knowledge  is 
essentially in the discovery category. From the examination of the benefits and costs, it 
is clear that these arguments for allowing protection reflect a clash between efficiency- 
based  arguments of promoting innovation and correcting market failures and equity- 
based  arguments of allowing monopoly protection to true innovators even if they are 
not consistent with the scientific knowledge definition. 

Given the approach of current international intellectual property agreements, some 
important questions are raised regarding what can be done to more appropriately deal 
with traditional knowledge within the international regime. The benefit that arises &om 
granting intellectual property  rights  is  innovation.  The reward for  innovating is  the 
opportunity  to  collect,  for  a  time,  the  monopoly  rents  available  from  devising  a 
successful innovation. There should be no grant of intellectual property rights without 
the promise of additional innovations. In particular, the granting of intellectual property 
rights to dxoveries can only act to reduce innovations. Granting intellectual property 
rights  to  discoveries  will  not  induce  additional discoveries  and  adds  to  the  cost  of 
innovation. Thus, the international intellectual property regime should act, in the first 
instance, to ensure that there is the widest possible access to the products of innovation 
through  low  trade  barriers  and  strong competition  policy  disciplines on the  private 
restraint  of trade  in those  industries that  produce  and  &stribUte  innovations derived 
from genetic material. In other words, strong efforts should be made to ensure that firms 
are  not  able  to  use  the  monopoly  granted  as  a  reward  for  innovation  to  generate 
additional opportunities for monopoly rents through practices such as  tied sales, input 

BIOPROSPECTING  OR BIOPIRACY?

bundling, failure to disclose crucial information to patent authorities, etc. Having the 
TRIPS within the general WTO structure should facilitate the former, while the TRIPS 
could be strengthened to make it easier for developing countries to obtain recourse if 
uncompetitive practices are observed among transnational biotechnology firms. 

There also needs to be a clear distinction in international patent law between those 
scientific innovations that  enhance the  process  of  discovery and  those  that  use  the 
information derived from discovery to innovate. Given that the information that arises 
from discovery has strong public-good  characteristics they are non-rivalrous, because 
the  use  of a gene with  identified commercial potential in  one  innovation does not 
restrict  its  use  in  another  and  exclusion  is  not  possible  due  to  the  ease  of  reverse 
engineering (Kerr and Yampoin, 2000). The development of gene isolating technology 
should have been publicly fbnded and made fieely avdable. This would have increased 
the rate of innovation. In the absence of the foresight to publicly fund this research, 
property rights have been extended to the technologies that facditate discovery and/or 
the discoveries arising from these processes. The United States, the European Union 
and Japan  all  have  legislation granting intellectual property  rights  to  gene  isolating 
technology  and  the  genetic  material  discovered.  Given  the  potential  size  of  the 
distortion relative to the costs of isolating genetic material, granting intellectual property 
rights in this area may not have been wise. 

One suspects that if no property rights were granted to  gene isolating processes 
and/or  the  genetic  material  subsequently discovered, firms  interested in  innovating 
using discovered genes with  commercial potential would have sugcient incentive to 
directly  search  for  those  genes  so  that  they  could  reap  the  benefits  fiom  owning 
intellectual property rights in the final products. Their techniques and discoveries would 
not receive intellectual property protection. This would preserve the public-good aspect 
of discovery by allowing others access to the technology/discovered genetic material. If 
the costs of developing genetic isolating technologies are large, one would expect open- 
access gene isolating technologes to be developed by private sector consoaiums so that 
the cost of development could be shared. If governments think that the private sector is 
providing too little genetic isolating technology and/or  genetic discoveries, then they 
could encourage this  activity through offering prizes. Prizes would both  remove the 
distortions associated with granting intellectual property rights and reduce the incentive 
to  keep  discovery-enhancing  innovations secret. For similar reasons, prizes  could be 
used to induce those who have  traditional knowledge regarding the value of natural 
organisms to share that knowledge. Encouraging the sharing of traditional knowledge 
through prizes would thus provide a solution to the problem of biopiracy. 

If  the  international  conventions  on  intellectual  property  continue  to  extend 
intellectual property rights  to  technologies that  enhance  discovery or  the  discoveries 
themselves,  then  they  should  also  extend  intellectual  property  rights  to  tradtional 
knowledge. It does not matter whether a discovery has arisen as a result ofexperience-based 

50

trahtional  methods  or through the use  of modem  scientific methods. The innovation 
inhibiting distortion is the same in each case, and to endow one with intellectual property 
rights while excludmg the other cannot be jusdied on grounds of equity. If societies with 
a high  degree of sciendic capabdity  are d n g  to  “live with” the distortions associated 
with extending intellectual property rights to scienhfically enhanced discoveries then they 
should not be  able  to  deny societies with little  scientific  capacity  but large  amounts of 
trahtional knowledge to extend intellectual property rights to that knowledge. Clearly, 
both inhibit innovation and are counter-productive to the original intent of the adicial 
creation of rights in intellectual property by governments. Both should be public goods, 
but if intellectual property rights can be extended to one method of discovery, it would not 
be equitable to exclude the other. 

Countries  with  a  high  degree  of scientific capacity  and  enforceable intellectual 
property rights systems should also ensure that their domestic patent laws do not allow 
the granting of intellectual property rights to what are traditional discoveries that have 
been acquired through biopiracy. There have been a number of high-profile cases in the 
United States and Japan (e.g. Mexican beans, bitter gourd, plao-noi (Kerr and Yampoin, 
2000)) where the Patent Office has granted a patent to an unaltered land race or natural 
plant.  The  problem  appears  to  lie  within  Patent  Offices  that  have  either  too  few 
resources to deal effectively with questions relating to living organisms or the technical 
capacity to make an informed judgment regardng them. As a result, the courts are left 
to sort out disputes. Of course, using the court system is not without cost. As those who 
have discovered traditional knowledge are either no longer identifiable or tend to have 
limited  resources, recourse  to  the  courts is  inequitable. If  societies that  have  a  high 
degree of scientlfic capacity want co-operation from developing countries in protecting 
their  intellectual property  through  TRIPS, then  they  need  to  ensure that  their  own 
patent institutions provide good models. 

The central question of equity, however, relates to relative scientific capacity. The 
major (but by  no means the only) reason why  the protection  of intellectual property 
rights  is  contentious  is  that  the  capacity  to  use  science  for  the  development  of 
innovations  is  not  distributed evenly  among  societies. Trahtional  societies typically 
have little scientific capacity and, therefore, have no opportunity to participate in the 
rents that arise fiom innovation. Hence, the solution to inequity lies in increasing the 
scientlfic capacity of members of those societies. Raising scientkic capacity is a complex 
and  resource-intensive  activity and  how  it  can  be  accomplished is  not  transparent. 
However, until the capacity of traditional societies to undertake scientific innovation is 
increased considerably, they will not be able to share equally in the benefits associated 
with  the  “knowledge economy”.  No  amount  of tinkering with  property  rights  can 
remove this fundamental cause of inequity. 

Attempts  to  redress  the  fundamental inequity  arising  from  differences  in  the 
capacity of societies to undertake scientific innovation through either the blanket denial 

BIOPROSPECTING OR BIOPIRACY? 

51 

of intellectual property rights in plant genetic resources or their wholesale extension to 
all  forms of knowledge, includmg traditional knowledge, seems counter-productive. 
Both wdl result in innovation being inhibited. Further, the preoccupation with the costs 
of monopoly distortion by developing countries and their supporters in segments of the 
non-governmental organization community should not be allowed to overshadow the 
very  large  market  failures  associated  with  geographic  insularity  and  cultural 
excludabihty. In particular, denying intellectual property protection of any form to plant 
genetic resources will perpetuate these market failures to the considerable detriment of 
mankind. 

Neither of these market failures, which are unique to plant genetic resources, are 

recognized in the TRIPS Agreement and should be explicitly considered by the TRIPS 
Council in its work arising from Paragraph 19 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration.
