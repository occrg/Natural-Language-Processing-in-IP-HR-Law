Further Developments on the
Return of Antiquities
David Gill* and Christopher Chippindale**

Abstract: During 2006 three major North American Museums, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Malibu, agreed to return a significant number of antiquities to
Italy. Acquisition information relating to the return of 26 items to Italy and 4 to
Greece from the Getty can be added to the details known from the objects re-
turned from Boston. A more detailed picture is emerging of how antiquities,
apparently looted from Italy, were being passed through Switzerland on their
way to dealers in Europe and North America. This information also points to-
ward other antiquities that may be included in future agreements.

The return of antiquities from North American museum collections to Italy gath-
ered pace during the closing months of 2006. The agreement to return 13 antiq-
uities from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston made a significant step forward
against the background of the decision by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York to return the Euphronios krater.1 However, in late November 2006 the
J. Paul Getty Museum agreed to return 26 antiquities to Italy (Appendix A).2 This
was in addition to the earlier return of antiquities that included the cup attributed

to Onesimos, a head of a Roman copy of a Greek original by Polykleitos, and the
Asteas krater. A number of antiquities have also been returned to Greece: a Boeo-
tian funeral relief of Athanias and a Thasian relief in the fall of 2006, and a marble
kore, and a gold wreath in March 2007 (Appendix B).3 It is becoming clear that
many of the items being claimed by Italy have been identified by Polaroids seized
in raids on premises relating to Giacomo Medici at the Geneva Freeport. This ev-
idence is emerging as part of the Rome trial of Marion True, formerly curator at
the Getty, and Robert E. Hecht, Jr. Although most of the objects have returned to
Italy, it is clear that the Polaroids are providing evidence that can be used by other
countries such as Greece.

THE RETURNING OBJECTS FROM MALIBU

The antiquities returning to Italy from Malibu were acquired from 1971 to 1996 (Fig-
ure 1). They range from Roman fresco fragments acquired in 1971 (Appendix A,
no. 25) to a series of antiquities that formed part of the Barbara and Lawrence Fleis-
chman collection that were added in 1996 (Appendix A, nos. 4, 5, 12, 22, 24, 26). Most
acquisitions were made during the 1980s. The largest group of objects is represented
by nine pieces of Attic pottery, some fragmentary (Appendix A, nos. 7–15). The near-
complete nature of some of the Attic pottery implies that the pieces were found in
a tomb; and Etruria is a likely, but not the only, possibility.4 A probable Italian find-

Getty Museum and returned to Italy.

spot could be inferred from some of the material such as Apulian (Appendix A,
nos. 16–21), Paestan (Appendix A, no. 22), and Etruscan pottery (Appendix A,
no. 23); an Etruscan terra-cotta antefix (Appendix A, no. 24); and possibly a Roman
wall painting (Appendix A, no. 25). In addition to these objects there were four pieces
of marble sculpture, including a polychrome lekanis (Appendix A, no. 2) and a group
representing two griffins attacking a fallen doe (Appendix A, no. 3). See Figures 2–7
for representations of some of the antiquities discussed.

MASTERPIECES FROM THE J. PAUL GETTY MUSEUM

In 1997 the J. Paul Getty Museum published slightly more than 100 antiquities as
Masterpieces of the J. Paul Getty Museum.5 The objects ranged from Bronze Age
Cycladic sculpture to late antique silver. Some Masterpieces, such as the Lans-
downe Herakles,6 were acquired by J. Paul Getty himself, whereas other pieces joined
the collection more recently. Of these Masterpieces, 15 have now been returned, or
are in the process of being returned, to Greece or Italy (Tables 1 and 2). Most are
representative of two main sections, the Archaic and Classical periods, and Etruria
and South Italy in the pre-Roman period. Indeed, 13 items, approximately one
quarter of the objects in these two sections (represented by 49 items), have been
or are about to be returned. Concern about the objects presented in Masterpieces
was expressed in a review article published in 1998:

tesy of The J. Paul Getty Museum [Appendix A, 3].

ibu 84.AE.569. Courtesy of The J. Paul Getty Museum [Appendix A, 9].

The more one researches individual Masterpieces in this selection, the
more one is left asking questions about provenance, authenticity, and
loss of context. These Masterpieces appear to represent a major loss of
knowledge in that they have probably been removed from their archae-
ological context in an unscientific manner. Devoid of real knowledge, all
that is left is speculation masquerading as connoisseurship. If these pieces
were Masterpieces in their own time and cultures, we shall probably never
know thanks to the activities of the clandestini.7

It now appears that it was right to be concerned: at least 10 items in the Getty’s list
of 26 pieces to be transferred to the Italian state appear in Masterpieces.

From the “Archaic and Classical” section, seven items have been or are due to
be returned. Among them is the marble kore purchased from Robin Symes that
has been returned to Greece (Appendix B, no. 1). Polaroids of the sculpture, still
showing attached earth, were allegedly seized in Giacomo Medici’s warehouse in
Geneva. A second piece of classical sculpture is a Boeotian funerary stela that was
almost certainly removed from a cemetery site in Central Greece (Appendix B,
no. 2). The remaining Archaic and Classical objects consisted of five Attic pots;
one was returned to Italy in 1999 and the other four are due to follow (Appen-
dix A, nos. 7, 9, 12, 13).

One item from the “Hellenistic” section was returned to Greece in 2007. The
gold wreath is said to have been discovered near Serres in northern Greece in 1990
before passing through the antiquities market in Germany and Switzerland (Ap-
pendix B, no. 3).8 It was purchased for $1.15 million in 1993 with Christoph Leon
of Basel acting as agent.9 Six items from the “Etruria and South Italy in the Pre-
Roman Period” section have been or are due to be returned to Italy. These include
an Etruscan terra-cotta antefix (Appendix A, no. 24), a South Italian bronze askos
in the shape of a siren (Appendix A, no. 26), Apulian (Appendix A, no. 19) and
Paestan (returned in 2005) kraters, a marble group of two griffins attacking a doe
(Appendix A, no. 3), and a marble lekanis painted with a scene showing Thetis
and the Nereids with the arms of Achilles (Appendix A, no. 2). There is a single
Roman item, a second-century ad marble statue of Apollo (Appendix A, no. 1).
At least two further items from Masterpieces, the bronze athlete recovered from
the Adriatic and the acrolithic statue of Aphrodite, are subject to requests from

Italy (Table 3). A Corinthian olpe attributed to the painter of Vatican 73, and pur-
chased from Robin Symes, has also been identified in the Medici Polaroids and
may form part of a future request.10

Former Owners and Private Collectors

The Getty material was derived a range of private collectors, dealers, and galleries
(Table 4). Three of the pieces appear to have resided at one stage in the Maurice Tem-
pelsman collection. Tempelsman is chairman of the board of Lazare-Kaplan, a dia-
mond company;11 11 of his antiquities were sold to the Getty in 1985 through the
agency of Robin Symes.12 The three marble objects (Appendix A, nos. 1–3), which
are to be returned, are said to appear in the Polaroids found in Geneva: “Each ob-
ject was shown in fragments, encrusted with earth, and photographed on an Italian
newspaper lying on a table with a multicolored tablecloth.”13 There was even spec-
ulation that the three pieces had come from the same site.14 Concerns about the ac-
quisition of the marble objects were expressed in an internal memorandum of
October 1985 by Arthur Houghton, one of the then curators at the Getty:

At the beginning of the month I had a chance to discuss the matter with
the dealer who had bought [the] three objects from the excavators. This
individual, Giacomo Medici, had sold one (the lekanis) to a second dealer,
Robert Hecht, and the griffins and Apollo to a third, Robin Symes. Hecht
later sold the lekanis to Symes, who then passed on the three sculptures
as a group to Maurice Tempelsman, from whom we bought them. Med-
ici informed me that he had acquired the lekanis and Apollo in 1976 or
1977, and that both had been found at the same location, a tomb which

included a number of vases by the Darius Painter, at a site “not far from
Taranto.” Hecht said the site was Orta Nova . . . Medici also said that the
Apollo came from the same site, but was found in the ruins of a villa
some 150 or 200 meters distant from the tomb whence the lekanis and
griffins came . . .15

Other former Tempelsman objects include the two marble portraits of L. Licinius
Nepos and an anonymous balding man both in the Getty,16 and the Middle King-
dom bronze statues allegedly from the Faiyum and now in the George Ortiz
collection.17

At least six of the pieces to be returned to Italy had formed part of the Barbara
and Lawrence Fleischman collection (Appendix A, nos. 4, 5, 12, 22, 24, 26). The
Getty acquired this collection in 1996, in part through donation and in part through
purchase (reportedly for some US$20 million).18 The collection itself had been
displayed at the Getty (October 13, 1994–January 15, 1995) and the Cleveland
Museum of Art (February 15–April 23, 1995).19 A study of the 183 catalog entries

of the Fleischman collection showed that 92% of the pieces had no known find-
spots; 3 had a named findspot, and 12 were given a reported findspot.20 At least
91% of the items surfaced for the first time after the 1973 watershed when there
was a public recognition of the issues surrounding the collecting of antiquities.21
The acquisition of the Fleischman collection was controversial because although
the Getty had introduced a new acquisition policy in 1995 (“the piece had to have
been previously documented as being in an established collection”), the fact that
the Fleischman material had been documented in a Getty-sponsored exhibition
(1994–1995) and catalog meant that there was no perceived problem over its ac-
quisition.22 The collection quickly became an embarrassment to the Getty. In Feb-
ruary 1999 the head of a Roman copy of Polykleitos’ Diadoumenos had to be
returned to Italy because it was apparently stolen from the excavation storerooms
at Venosa.23 The flawed acquisition policy, heralded by Marion True, has only led
to the further damage of the Getty’s reputation.

Pieces formerly owned by the Fleischmans were increasingly suspect after Po-
laroids showing items from the collection had been seized at the Geneva Free-
port.24 Documentation has shown that this material passed into the collection
through the hands of Fritz Bürki, Robin Symes, and Atlantis Antiquities (co-
owned by Robert E. Hecht, Jr.).25 The Fleischmans also bought from other col-
lectors: the Etruscan terra-cotta antefix (Appendix A, no. 24) once resided in
the Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt collection.26 Among the Fleis-
chman pieces was an Attic red-figured calyx-krater signed by Syriskos (Appen-
dix A, no. 12).27 This was purchased from Robin Symes in 1988; Polaroids showing
the restoration of the krater were found in the raid in Geneva.28 The krater is
interesting because it carries an apparently ancient price inscription suggesting
that it was valued at 1 stater. Such a value is important because it is worth con-

siderably more than other known ancient prices.29 These commercial graffiti
have demonstrated that pottery was relatively cheap in antiquity and certainly
not a luxury like silver and gold plate; a single silver phiale could have a bullion
value of 1 mina (i.e., 100 drachmas).30 This position is in contrast to those who
would argue for the high place of pottery in antiquity and therefore its value
for contemporary collectors who can justify the high prices demanded by the

antiquities market.31 Such ancient price inscriptions are extremely rare on pot-
tery found in Tuscany, and it is thus likely that the Syriskos calyx-krater was
discovered in a cemetery of one of the western Greek colonies in southern Italy
or Sicily. The intellectual consequences of such looting are apparent: Where was
such a price for Athenian pottery asked? This of course assumes that the com-
mercial graffito was added in antiquity and not inscribed in recent years by an
experienced hand.

One of the other donors of the returning Italian antiquities was Vasek Polak of
Canada. Among the objects associated with Polak is the Etruscan dusk askos (Ap-
pendix A, no. 23) that was reported as having once been in the S. Schweitzer col-
lection (1940). The Schweitzer collection certainly existed. Sir John Beazley was
familiar with pottery from this collection in his studies of Attic black- and red-
figured pottery that were published in 1956 and 1963 respectively, and several
of these pieces now reside in the Antikenmuseum und Sammlung Ludwig in
Basel.32 However, Watson and Todeschini have made the suggestion that the
Schweitzer collection has been used as a convenient way to launder recently sur-
faced antiquities as it was difficult to cross-check the original contents of the col-
lection.33 In an auction at Sotheby’s, London, on July 15, 1980, 16 Greek pots
said to come from the collection surfaced.34 What was their documented history
prior to the sale? The duck askos was not the first piece from the Getty associated
with the Schweitzer collection to be returned to Italy. Fragments of the Onesimos
cup were also said once to have been in the Samuel Schweitzer collection of
Arlesheim.35

In 1982 Polak also donated one of the fragments for the calyx-krater attrib-
uted to the Berlin painter (Appendix A, no. 14). The earliest fragment was
donated in 1977 by Herbert L. Lucas, a trustee of the Getty, and this was fol-
lowed by further gifts from Dietrich von Bothmer (1984) and purchases from
Galerie Nefer (1984) and Frederick H. Schultz, Jr. (1987). Together the price
paid for the purchased fragments is reported to have been $101,900.36 It has
already been observed that the fragments arrived in batches. Von Bothmer
has indicated that his policy was to donate fragments from his personal collec-
tion “when they would fit another vase in the collection,”37 but this does not
explain the origin of the fragments. It is unknown if the fragments of a
calyx-krater attributed to the Berlin painter and loaned by Giacomo Medici via
Atlantis Antiquities in 1987 were indeed from the same krater.38 Among Polak’s
other gifts to the Getty was an Attic grave stele presented to the museum in
1982.39

Gordon McLendon donated two Apulian pots to the Getty in 1977 (Appen-
dix A, nos. 20, 21). McLendon, who was involved in radio stations, collected an-
tiquities in part derived from Summa Galleries and Numismatic Fine Arts.40 It is
alleged that Frel encouraged donations from McLendon at an “exaggerated ap-
praisal.”41 In 1977 McLendon also donated an Attic volute-krater attributed to
the Kleophrades painter that remains in the Getty.42

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS ON THE RETURN OF ANTIQUITIES

217

Dealers and Restorers

Most antiquities being returned to Italy from the Getty passed through the hands
of dealers and restorers in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and North America.
At least two of the dealers were, at the time, members of the International Asso-
ciation of Dealers in Ancient Art (IADAA); one of the two galleries, Galerie Nefer,
has recently resigned from the organization.43 This in itself raises serious issues
about the usefulness of the ethical guidelines used by members of the IADAA and
the monitoring of members to ensure that recently looted antiquities do not pass
through their hands.
North America

One returning Getty piece was acquired from Atlantis Antiquities in New York
(Appendix A, no. 17). This gallery was jointly owned by Robert E. Hecht and
Jonathan Rosen, and some of the Boston deaccessioned antiquities had also passed
through it.44 A fragment of one calyx-krater was purchased from Frederick H.
Schultz, Jr. (Appendix A, no. 14).45 Schultz was imprisoned and fined in June 2003
for handling looted antiquities; he was involved with Jonathan Tokely-Parry, who
faced trial in the United Kingdom.46 The Roman fresco fragments (Appendix A,
no. 25) were purchased from The Royal Athena Galleries in New York owned by
Jerome Eisenberg; two deaccessioned antiquities in Boston were handled by the
same gallery.47 The Royal Athena Galleries supplied 14 South Italian pots to the
Getty in the same year.48 A further North American source for the Getty material
was the Acanthus Gallery in New York (Appendix A, no. 12).
United Kingdom

Robin Symes was the main U.K.-based dealer in antiquities who handled several
of the Getty pieces. These included three pieces of Attic pottery (Appendix A, nos.
8, 9, 12); in one case the Getty acquired the pot through the Fleischmans (Appen-
dix A, no. 12). Symes also handled the archaic kore (Appendix B, no. 1), and the
three pieces from the Tempelsman collection (Appendix A, nos. 1–3).49 Apart from
these objects, that have been returned or will be returning to Greece and Italy,
Symes was the source for a group of Cycladic pots originally from the Erlenmeyer
collection in Switzerland purchased by the Getty in February 1991.50
Switzerland

At least six of the returning antiquities from the Getty were handled by Fritz Bürki
(Appendix A, nos. 5, 7, 13, 16, 18, 19), whose associations with Hecht and Gia-
como Medici have been documented elsewhere.51 Two pieces passed through the
Galerie Nefer, Zurich (Appendix A, nos. 10, 14). Until recently, Galerie Nefer was
a member of the IADAA.52 The gallery is owned by Frida Tchacos, the wife of
Werner Nussberger who has donated two items to the Getty (Appendix A, nos. 6,
10). The fragments of the Douris phiale (Appendix A, no. 10) came from either
the Galerie Nefer or Nussberger.53 Yet, this picture is only partial because Symes

DAVID GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE

and Bürki are also reported to have held fragments.54 An Attic red-figured calyx-
krater (Appendix A, no. 11) passed through Münzen und Medaillen in Basel be-
fore being acquired by the Morat-Institut in Freiburg and then was sold to the
Getty by Christoph Leon of Basel. Leon also sold the gold wreath to the Getty,
which has been returned to Greece (Appendix B, no. 3).55 Leon was involved with
selling antiquities to other museums, for example, the four Apulian pots to the
Antikensammlung of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin.56 Further reports suggest
that he brokered a deal over a classical bronze that surfaced on the Munich market.57
At least seven Getty pieces appeared in Polaroids found on Medici’s premises
in the Geneva Freeport.58 Among them was a Pontic amphora formerly in the
Fleischman collection, the Douris phiale and an Attic cup signed by Douris
(Appendix A, nos. 5, 9–10). One link between the Getty and Medici is illustrated
by telling comments in a letter from Marion True to Medici on January 22, 1992.
In concluding she mentions, “I am enclosing with this letter, with my compli-
ments, a copy of Greek Vases 5. I hope that you enjoy it. I think that you will
find many pieces included that you will recognize.”59 The implication is clear:
Medici handled some of the pots before they were acquired by the Getty. A study
of the sources for the pots and fragments illustrated in volume 5 of Greek Vases
in the J. Paul Getty Museum (1991) suggest some possible lines of enquiry
(Table 5). Six pieces were acquired from the Bareiss collection in 1986.60 Of the
remaining pieces, one of the most common sources for these items was Galerie
Nefer, in other words Frida Tchacos; her husband is named as the donor of sev-
eral pieces.61 Indeed in three cases, Nussberger gives the fragment of a pot, and
this was followed some years later by purchases from Galerie Nefer. Was the gift
intended to set the purchase in motion? Another interesting source for items in
Getty Vases volume 5 was the Hydra Gallery; items include a fragment purchased
in 1985. This gallery was the base for Christian Boursaud, who appears to have
been the agent for Giacomo Medici.62 One of the other Getty fragments was
purchased from Antike Kunst Palladion of Basel, run by Ursula (“Rosie”) Becchina,
wife of Gianfranco Becchina.63 One illustrated piece from Getty Vases volume 5,
the Douris phiale, is to be returned to Italy; and the Onesimos cup has already
been returned.

OUTSTANDING ITEMS IN THE GETTY

The items to be returned to Italy by the Getty are not the only pieces identified in
Polaroids seized in Geneva.69 At least eight further pieces from the Fleischman
collection have been linked (Table 6). Five passed through the hands of Bürki and
two through Robin Symes. It is possibly significant that a note linked to one of the
Attic black-figured amphorae showed that “RG” had claimed that the amphora
was “found together with” two other pots, one owned by Robert E. Hecht, and a
hydria in the possession of Robin Symes.70

Objects formerly in the Fleischman collection identified by Watson and

Todeschini as appearing in Polaroids in Corridor 17 Geneva76

(excludes material due to be returned to Italy and listed in Appendix A)

1. A marble Tyche.77 Malibu 96.AA.49. Purchased from Robin Symes; purchased from the

Fleischmans for US$2 million.

2. An Attic black-figured amphora, “reconstructed from fragments.”78 Malibu 96.AE.92.
Herakles attacking Geryon. Attributed to the painter of Berlin 1686 (Dietrich von Both-
mer). Reassembled by Fritz Bürki (1988); Atlantis Antiquities (1988).

3. An Attic black-figured amphora.79 Malibu 96.AE.93. Attributed to the Three-Line Group
(Dietrich von Bothmer). Purchased from Fritz Bürki (1989). Said to have been found
with two other pots (in the possession of Robert Hecht and Robin Symes).

4. An Attic red-figured cup, “reconstructed from a few large fragments.”80 Malibu 96.AE.97.
Attributed to the Nikosthenes painter (Robert Guy); potter, Pamphaios (Robert Guy).
Purchased from Symes (1988).

5. An Apulian bell-krater, “reconstructed from fragments.”81 Malibu 96.AE.29. Attributed

to the Choregos painter (A.D. Trendall). Acquired from Fritz Bürki.

6. An Apulian red-figured bell-krater. Purchased from Fritz Bürki.82
7. A Roman fresco fragment, mask of Herakles.83 Malibu 96.AG.171. Purchased from Fritz
Bürki. Associated with a fragment in the Shelby White collection, and from the same
room as (8).

8. A Roman fresco fragment.84 Malibu 96.AG.170. Apparently from the same room as (7).

The Geneva Polaroids also identify non-Fleischman material, mostly pottery, in
the Getty. These include a Corinthian olpe and a Corinthian oinochoe, both at-
tributed to the painter of Vatican 73 and both purchased from Robin Symes in
1985.71 Two pieces were said to have passed through an old British collection, the
Rycroft Collection. These are an Attic red-figured amphora, with an inscription Hai-
simides kalos, purchased from Antike Kunst Palladion in Basel, which had ac-
quired it “from a company owned by Gianfranco Becchina,”72 and an Attic red-
figured cup (type A) attributed to Epiktetos that was given by Michael R. Milken
in August 1983.73 Because both appear in Polaroids, the cup “not only dirty but
fragmented,” it seems likely that this history of being associated with the Rycroft
collection was fabricated.74 A fifth piece appearing in the Polaroids is an Attic jan-
iform kantharos, attributed to the Vatican class and the Sabouroff class, and pur-
chased from the Royal Athena Galleries in New York.75

There are also two important pieces of sculpture in the Getty that have been
requested by the Italian government, but they do not form part of the present
agreement. The first is an acrolithic statue (in part consisting of marble from the
island of Paros) perhaps representing a goddess.85 The statue surfaced in Swit-
zerland, apparently in a private collection in Lugano, passed through the hands
of Robin Symes, and soon after its acquisition for $18 million in July 1988 was
the subject of an Interpol enquiry.86 Thomas Hoving “declared” that Morgantina

222

DAVID GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE

in Sicily has the original find spot.87 At the time of acquisition Malcolm Bell was
said to comment, “I know of no reason to argue that [the statue] was found at
Morgantina.”88 Two reasons were given: No such acrolithic statue was found at
Morgantina, and a late fifth century bc date was when the city was in decline.
Such statues are uncommon and there is no reason to discount Morgantina as a
possible findspot. Some scholars date the statue to the third century bc, so it is
difficult to map the statue onto historical events. It has also been suggested that
the statue was in private hands since 1939; but there appears to be no documen-
tary evidence to support this and it is clear from the return of material from
Boston that attributions to old collections are being fabricated. A development
occurred in 2006 when Bell refuted the words that Marion True had attributed
to him.89

The second statue is a bronze of a victorious youth acquired by the Getty in
1977 for a reported $3.95 million.90 There is general agreement that it was found
in the Adriatic off Fano, but there is a dispute about whether or not it was found
in international waters. It appears to have been fished from the sea in the early
1960s and certainly by 1965.91 The statue was subsequently acquired in 1971 by
Heinz Herzer of Munich. Little is known about the shipwreck, but one report sug-
gested it may have been Medieval in date.92

Countries other than Italy or Greece may have claims for other objects in the
Getty. Among the Masterpieces are the mummy portrait of Isidora “probably from
el-Hibeh (Ankyronpolis)” acquired in 1981,93 a Roman cameo glass flask with an
Egyptian scene said to have been found at Eski,sehir, Turkey, before passing through
a Swiss private collection,94 and a Roman cameo glass skyphos decorated with
satyrs and young women “said to have been one of a pair found in a Parthian
tomb in Iran.”95 Equally telling is a group of Roman bronzes that may have formed
part of a single ancient display, but the whereabouts of the original monument is
no longer known. But it is significant that the three Roman bronzes in the Getty,
togate magistrates, a bronze Ceres or Juno, and a bronze Roma or Virtus, “trav-
elled through the art market” with a Victory with a Cornucopia now in the Cleve-
land Museum of Art.96 The associations with Symes and Tempelsman are perhaps
suggestive, and moreover it is telling that in April 2007 it was reported that the
Italian government requested the return of the Cleveland Victory.97

POSSIBLE FUTURE REQUESTS TO NORTH AMERICAN MUSEUMS

The success of the Italian authorities in obtaining the return of antiquities from
three major museums in North America means that the spotlight will be turned
onto several other collections that are reported to have acquired antiquities from
the same route. These are likely to include the Cleveland Museum of Art (see Fig-
ure 8), the Toledo Museum of Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and the Prince-
ton University Art Museum.

FIGURE 8. Decade of acquisition for antiquities in the Cleveland Museum of Art which
were reported by Mazur as requested by the Italian Government (April 2007).

The Cleveland Museum of Art

The museum is alleged to have acquired “looted material” from Hecht, and is said
to have had “close relations” with Becchina.98 In 2006 Mazur identified a number
of pieces in the collection, all likely to have been found in Italy given their fabrics
(Apulian, Campania, Lucanian, and Paestan)99:

• A Lucanian calyx-krater, attributed to the Policoro painter: 1991.1100; ex-
Hunt collection and sold 1990; alleged to have been purchased from Hecht

• An Apulian bell-krater, attributed to the Choregos painter: 1989.73101
• An Apulian volute-krater, attributed to the Darius painter: 1988.41
• A Campanian red-figured acorn lekythos: 1986.204; gift of Jonathan Rosen
• A Paestan black-figured lekythos: 1985.1; allegedly acquired through Hecht

A more extensive list of objects reportedly claimed by the Italian government was
published by Mazur in April 2007.102 This list included material that was known
before the UNESCO 1970 convention. Among them was a Roman silver cup found
in the sanctuary at Vicarello in Italy and first published in 1866,103 and fragments
of a Roman marble sarcophagus acquired in 1925.104 More recently acquired ob-
jects (i.e., post-1970) included the bronze statue of a barbarian, “said to have been
found near Taranto,”105 a bronze Herakles, and a bronze Lar, “purchased together
and conceivably found [together],”106 and a Victory with Cornucopia that “trav-

224

DAVID GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE

elled through the art market and conceivably found with” three bronzes in the
Getty.107 No detailed response has as yet been made by the museum.108

The Toledo Museum of Art

It was noted by Watson and Todeschini that Hecht sold the Toledo Museum of Art
“looted material.”109 Sewell reports that an image of the Etruscan kalpis, attrib-
uted to the Micali painter and showing Dionysos and the pirates, was found among
the Geneva Polaroids.110 The cup was acquired from a dealer in 1982. The Toledo
Museum of Art issued a statement about the kalpis:

In April 2001, the Toledo Museum of Art provided copies of its docu-
mentation and correspondence regarding an Etruscan kalpis to Thomas
A. Karol, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Northern District of Ohio (Toledo),
U.S. Department of Justice. The Museum understood that such infor-
mation was solicited at the request of the Italian government. Since sup-
plying the requested information, the Museum has received no further
inquiries. The Museum has cooperated with all official inquiries and will
continue to do so.111

The Minneapolis Institute of Arts

An Attic red-figured volute-krater, attributed to the Methyse painter, was the gift
of Mr. and Mrs. Donald C. Dayton; it was purchased from Robin Symes in 1983.112
It was said to have been in private collections in Switzerland and Great Britain for
about 15 years leading up its acquisition in 1983. The piece is reported to have
been identified by one of the Polaroids seized in Geneva. According to the official
statement issued by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in November 2005:
The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has learned that an object in our per-
manent collection could be among a number of objects in American
museums that the Italian government alleges to have been recently ex-
cavated in Italy. We have not been contacted by the Italian authorities
about this object. We have seen only an electronic image of a detail of
the shoulder of a vase, which we received from a Los Angeles Times jour-
nalist without any accompanying documentation. As a leading museum,
we uphold the principle that all collecting be done according to the high-
est standards of ethical and professional practice. Although no contact
or claim has been made, to date, by the Italian authorities, we are none-
theless taking the matter seriously, and, if after gathering the facts it is
established that the Italian government has a legitimate claim, we will
respond in an appropriate and responsible fashion.113

The Princeton University Art Museum

Four pieces in Princeton are reported by Osellame to be under investigation.114
The first is an Attic red-figured psykter, attributed to the Kleophrades Painter, and
given to the Princeton University Art Museum by a group of Princeton alumni,
Peter Jay Sharp (class of 1952) through the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation; Lloyd E.

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS ON THE RETURN OF ANTIQUITIES

225

Cotsen (class of 1950); John B. Elliott (class of 1951); and Jonathan P. Rosen through
the Joseph Rosen Foundation.115 Sharp was a real estate developer and served on
the Princeton University Art Museum advisory council until 1987. Cotsen was the
president of Neutrogena but had a long-standing interest in classical archaeology
as a member of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens116 and as a
benefactor of the Institute of Archaeology that bears his name at UCLA. Elliott
had an interest in Greek pottery with his own collection.117 Rosen is a New York
lawyer who was joint owner with Hecht of Atlantis Antiquities in New York.118
Hecht recalls a psykter in his Memoirs:

Mauro [Moroni] met me [Hecht] at the airport and we drove directly to
his home in Cerveteri to show me the vase. It was a psykter, a vase used
for wine cooling, decorated with reclining banqueters drinking from var-
ious vessels . . . Within a few days Mauro delivered the psykter to Zurich
and we concluded the deal at $225,000.119

This psykter was offered to the Getty but is reported to have been turned down be-
cause it was thought that the pot was a forgery. The psykter was subsequently ac-
quired by Princeton.120 The other pieces in Princeton under discussion are said to
be an Apulian loutrophoros, an Etruscan plaque, and a Roman silver cup.121 A press
statement was made by Princeton in relation to the psykter and the loutrophoros in
November 2005:

In December 2004, Italian authorities investigating an alleged violation
of the laws of Italy requested details about the acquisition in 1989 of
two ancient Greek painted ceramic vases by the Princeton University Art
Museum.

The vases in question are an Athenian red-figure wine-cooler (psyk-
ter), dating to 510 to 500 bc, and an Apulian red-figure loutrophoros of
about 330 bc. In January 2005, the art museum provided Italian author-
ities with the information requested. Since that time, the museum has
received no further communication from authorities in Italy, but they
are quoted in recent press accounts as stating that they possess evidence
that the two vases left Italy illegally and should be returned. According
to Susan M. Taylor, who has been director of the Princeton University
Art Museum since 2000, “The museum purchased these vases in good
faith and has no knowledge of any wrongdoing associated with their ac-
quisition. If proof of illegality is presented to the museum, the vases will
be returned, as we have returned other items in the past.” 122

SUMMARY

A study of the antiquities to be returned by the Getty to Italy has raised several
issues and has highlighted the corrupting influence of a flawed acquisition policy
over the last 35 years. It is important to praise both the Getty and the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston for their transparency in this matter because they agreed to
the return of their items. The acquisition histories have been made available with-
out any restrictions (see Figure 9).123 It is hoped that such openness will be of-

226

DAVID GILL AND CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE

FIGURE 9. Decade of acquisition for antiquities deaccessioned by the Museum of Fine
Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the J. Paul Getty Museum.

fered by the other museums and collections reported to contain objects over which
the Italian government may have some claim.

There are several lessons to learn from these cases of returning antiquities. First,
it is clear that it was nearly impossible to build up a collection of legitimately
provenanced masterpieces in the closing decades of the twentieth century either
through purchases on the open market or by the acquisition of contemporary North
American private collections. High-quality finds that are unknown to scholarship
are very likely to be fresh finds from looted sites. The antiquities acquired since
1970 have been liberally peppered with items that appear to have surfaced through
illicit digging. A collection such as that formed by the Getty is widely acknowl-
edged as containing items with “no provenance or known context.”124 Museum
curators must restrict acquisitions for objects that are known to have surfaced—
and are securely documented—prior to the UNESCO Convention of 1970.125

Second, the evidence suggests that the attribution of objects to old collections
can be deliberately falsified. The placing of objects in uncataloged (or partially
cataloged) late nineteenth-century collections seems to be a calculated move on
the part of some dealers. Museums need to have certified evidence of the attribu-
tion. Word of mouth can no longer be used as evidence.

Third, bodies such as the IADAA need to demonstrate that their members do
stick to their guidelines. James Ede, managing director of Charles Ede Ltd. and a
vice-president of the IADAA, recently commented, “For many years, responsible
dealers have been aware of the damage uncontrolled excavation does and have
fought hard to distance themselves from those who operate outside the law and to
avoid purchasing the fruits of such activity.”126

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS ON THE RETURN OF ANTIQUITIES

227

The appearance of objects that have passed through the galleries of members of
the IADAA and that appear in the list of returning objects from both Boston and
the Getty can only suggest that the IADAA guidelines are little more than window
dressing. Has the IADAA taken appropriate action against members that flout their
guidelines? Some scholars have been quick to defend dealers and the antiquities
market, and in so doing have implicitly endorsed the continuing destruction of
archaeological sites; but such views are in a minority.127

Fourth, it is clear from studies of the Boston and Malibu material that the same
names of dealers and restorers are appearing, among them Bürki, Hecht, and Symes.
The organigram linked to the Medici conspiracy seems to lead into the heart of
these institutions.

Fifth, dealers in antiquities may have devised strategies to ensure sales to the
Getty by using pottery fragments to initiate an acquisition process. A sale was
planned to take several years, perhaps started by an initial donation and then fol-
lowed up by sales from key dealers, notably Galerie Nefer. This selling strategy
seems to have included the deliberate breaking of pots to make the system work.
These returns of antiquities are damaging to the reputations of fine public in-
stitutions and their curatorial staff. Whereas in past decades major museums may
have been seen as the final resting place for collections in private hands, the ac-
quisition of a collection like that formed by the Fleischmans has only brought
severe embarrassment to the Getty. Who would now acquire the Shelby White and
Leon Levy collection knowing that several of the items appear in the Polaroids
seized in Geneva and that the Italian authorities have reportedly asked for the
return of antiquities?128 The acceptance of a gift or bequest, let alone an outright
purchase, by any museum would almost certainly be followed by a formal request
for their return. Will Shelby White do the honourable thing and return her an-
tiquities to the appropriate foreign governments?129

The story is far from over. There are thousands of antiquities now residing in
public and private collections still to be identified from the seized Polaroids. There
is already a short list of antiquities which museums in North America, Europe,
and Japan should return before formal requests are made by the Italian and other
governments.130 Failure to cooperate will only further damage the reputations of
museums, their curatorial staff (past and present), and their trustees. Much of the
focus has been on antiquities that have returned to Italy but it is clear that other
countries such as Greece and Turkey have strong moral claims on antiquities that
have clearly been removed from sites in their countries. Further more substantial
returns of antiquities can be anticipated.

POSTSCRIPT

On August 1, 2007 the J. Paul Getty Museum announced that a further 14 objects
would be returned to Italy in addition to the objects discussed here. Seven of the

Works.”

10. Watson and Todeschini, The Medici Conspiracy, 346. This was also acquired with a Corinthian
oinochoe (inv. no. 85.AE.88), attributed to the same painter, and acquired from the same source at
the same time.

11. Watson and Todeschini, The Medici Conspiracy, 74, 123–25.
12. Watson and Todeschini, The Medici Conspiracy, 124. The total value of the three pieces is
given as $10.2 million, see Felch and Frammolino, “Getty Had Signs it was Acquiring Possibly Looted
Art.” Symes is reported as the source for many of the Tempelsman pieces.

20. Chippindale and Gill, “Material Consequences of Contemporary Classical Collecting,” 474–
75, Tables 3 and 4. Barbara Fleischman is reported to have said in 2005: “We were absolute inno-
cents. . . . We thought we were buying it from legitimate dealers. Looking back at it, maybe it was
naïve” (in Felch and Frammolino, “Getty Had Signs it was Acquiring Possibly Looted Art”).

21. For the choice of 1973 as a watershed: Chippindale and Gill, “Material Consequences of Con-
temporary Classical Collecting,” 470–71. Some would consider 1971 more appropriate. It is perhaps
significant that Shelby White suggests that public awareness of looted antiquities is something new,
“It is hard to apply current standards to something that happened thirty years ago” (quoted in Mead,
“Den of Antiquity,” 60). The ethical standards were adopted by the AIA more than 30 years ago.

have not been made public in the news reports. Possible pieces could include the Apulian loutro-
phoros, attributed to the Darius painter (inv. 1989–29), museum purchase, anonymous gift (Prince-
ton University Art Museum, “Acquisitions of the Art Museum 1989,” 47 [ill.], 53 [text]), and the
recently acquired Roman silver cup (inv. 2000–356), museum purchase (Princeton University Art
Museum, “Acquisitions of the Art Museum 2000,” 90 [ill.]).

the provenance of an acquisition must be preserved, and . . . all such information shall be made
available to the public upon written request.” For the policy: www.getty.edu/about/governance/pdfs/

November 17, 1970 (the date of he UNESCO Convention) to define the surfacing of archaeological
material. For a good example of an archaeologically-based North American collection, see Bald Ro-

It is perhaps significant that the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court will open in April 2007 at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Failure by Shelby White to resolve this issue can only be
detrimental to the reputation to the MMA. For an interview with Shelby White, see Mead, “Den of
Antiquity,” especially 60.

129. For Shelby White’s view of collecting, see White, “Building American Museums.” For the
collection, see von Bothmer, Glories of the Past. Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, regards Shelby White and Leon Levy as “those two most generous and dedicated
New York collectors” (in Picón et al., Art of the Classical World, vii). For a discussion of the collec-
tion, see Taylor, “Shelby White in Center Court at the Met.”
