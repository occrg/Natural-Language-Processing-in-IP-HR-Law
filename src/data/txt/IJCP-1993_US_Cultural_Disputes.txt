Evolving U.S. Case  Law  on
Cultural  Property  Disputes
Judith Church*

1  Introduction

The value  of  illegally  traded  art  and  antiquities  world-wide  is esti-
mated  to  be  between  $2  billion  and  $6  billion  a  year.1  Not  only
does one encounter the expected art smugglers and Customs agents,
but  English  aristocrats2 and  venerable  museums3 have become em-
broiled  in the morass of conflicting  claims to art  and  antiquities. A
growing  number  of  parties  have  sought  a  determination  of  their
rights  in  U.S. courts.  In  light  of  the  important  role  played  by  the
courts in deciding these conflicts, it behooves one to ask what rules,
if  any,  have emerged  from  prior  U.S. case  law.  If  rules  of  law  are
fashioned  with  an  eye  toward  regulating  private  conduct,  what
should  an  owner  or  purchaser  of  a  work  of  art  or  antiquity  have
to  do  to  prevail  in a  U.S. court?4 This  question  has  been  raised  in
several  lawsuits  wherein  a  foreign  sovereign  state  has  sought  the
return  of  cultural  property.  The  answer  appears  to  depend  on
whether  the sovereign  knew the cultural property existed, had  done
something to document  its existence and  had  provided  notice to all
through  national  legislation that such cultural property  belonged  to
the  state.  While  it  is  too  early  to  state  that  the  decisions  form  a
coherent  policy  toward  resolving  cultural  property  disputes,  it  can
be  said  that  settled  positions  are  evolving  around  which  private
parties can  structure  their  behavior.

This article focuses  on four  decisions by U.S. courts  that  involve
competing claims  to cultural  property.  There are at  present  several
cases in various stages in the courts whose resolution  will no doubt
clarify  further  this emerging doctrine.5

The decided  cases are  United  States  v. Hollinshead,6  United  States
v. McClain,1  Peru  v. Johnson*  and  Jeanneret  v.  Vichey.9  Part  I  will

discuss Hollinshead and its enlargement of the common law meaning
of  'stolen'  to  include legislative  declarations  of  ownership.  Part  II
will  discuss  McClain and  its  restriction  of  the  rule  in  Hollinshead.
Part  III  discusses  Johnson and  the  corresponding  criminal  case
involving  objects  from  Peruvian  sites,  United States  v.  Swetnam.i0
Part  IV will discuss  Vichey and  the distinction  between export  laws
and  ownership laws and  the implication  of that distinction  for bona
fide  purchasers. Part V will develop the doctrinal  points of law that
have  emerged  from  the  above  mentioned  decisions  and  identify
areas where judicial resolution  is still  required.

2  Part  I
United States  v.  Hollinshead

Clive Hollinshead, a dealer in pre-Columbian  artifacts, was charged
with  causing  the  transportation  of  stolen  property  in  interstate
commerce  and  conspiring to  transport  stolen  property  in  interstate
commerce  in  violation  of  the National  Stolen  Property  Act.11  Hol-
linshead  arranged  with George Alamilla  to procure  pre-Columbian
artifacts  in  Central  America.  After  excavation,  the  artifacts  were
transported  to  a  fish  packing  plant  in  Belize  City,  then  British
Honduras  now  Belize,  owned  by  Johnnie  Brown  Fell.  Here  the
artifacts  were  packed  in  boxes  marked  'personal  effects'  and  ad-
dressed  to  Hollinshead  in  California.12  Hollinshead  and  Fell  super-
vised  the  packing  of  the  objects  in  the  presence  of  Guatemalan
officers  who were  bribed  to insure  their  cooperation.13

The  artifacts  were  shipped  to  Miami,  Florida  where  Fell  and
another  conspirator  received  the crates and  began  trying to dispose
of the artifacts. Unfortunately  for the conspirators, one of the pieces
they  had  dismembered,  crated  and  shipped  was  a  pre-Columbian
stela  known  as  Machaquila  Stela  2,  a  rare  Mayan  ruin  from  the
jungle of Guatemala. The stela had been photographed  in the 1960's
by  an  archaeologist,  Ian  Graham,  for  the  Peabody  Museum  of
Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.14 Graham docu-
mented  the stela in photographs and drawings in 1962 and  returned
to  the site in  1968, at which  time the stela  was still  in situ. In 1971,
Graham  was  contacted  by  a  curator  at  the  Brooklyn  Museum,
requesting  Graham's opinion  about a pre-Columbian  stela the Mu-
seum  had  been  offered  by Clive Hollinshead.15  Graham  recognized
the  monument  and  notified  the  authorities.  The  government  of
Guatemala,  alerted  to  the  location  of  the  stela,  instituted  suit  for
its  return.16  Before  the  case  came  to  trial,  the  stela  was  seized  by
the FBI  for  importation  without  a proper  customs  declaration.17

Hollinshead,  Fell and  Alamilla  were indicted  on August  28, 1972
on  counts  of  conspiracy  to transport  stolen  goods  and  causing  the
transportation  of  stolen  property  in  interstate  commerce.18  They
were convicted  on  both counts on  March  14, 1973.

U.S. Case Law on Cultural Property  Disputes

On  appeal,  Fell  and  Hollinshead  raised  nine  claims  of  error.19
Eight  of  the  claims  related  to  evidentiary  issues  that  the  court
reviewed  and  found  to  be without  merit.  The  ninth  claim  centered
around  a jury  charge  in  which  the  trial  judge  instructed  the jury
that,  'there is a presumption  that every person  knows what the law
forbids.'20  The defendants  correctly  pointed  out  that  it was the law
of  Guatemala  that  characterized  the  stela  as  stolen  property  and
that  there  was  no  presumption  that  the  defendants  knew  Guate-
malan  law.21  The  court,  however,  found  adequate  evidence  in  the
record  as  to  the  law  of  Guatemala  pertaining  to  artifacts  such  as
the stela. It also found  'overwhelming  evidence that  the  defendants
knew  that  it  was contrary  to  Guatemalan  law  to  remove  the  stela
and that the stela was stolen.'22 The laws of Guatemala under which
the country  claimed  title  included  Articles  107 and  129 of  its  1965
Constitution,  Congress  Decree  No.  425  of  19  September  1947  as
amended  by  Decree-Law  No.  437  of  24  March  1966.23 The  court
found  that  Guatemalan  law declared  that  'all  such artifacts  are  the
property  of the Republic and  may not  be removed  without permis-
sion of the  government.'24

In  addition  to  determining  the  Guatemalan  law,  the  court's  in-
struction to the jury included that the offense  charged required  three
elements. These were: first, an  act  of  transporting  or causing  to be
transported  the  Mayan  artifact  known  as  Machaquila  Stela  2  in
interstate  commerce;  second,  with  the  knowledge  that  the  artifact
had  been  stolen; and  third,  that  the  Mayan  artifact  had  a  value of
$5,000 or more.25 The judge also had  to provide a definition  of the
term  'stolen'  for  purposes  of  the  National  Stolen  Property  Act.26
The  definition  used  by the court  was  borrowed  from  the  National
Motor  Vehicle Theft  Act.27

The  appellate  court  found  the  instructions  proper,  stating  that
'while  the  government  was  required  to  prove  that  the  appellants
knew  that  the  stela  was  stolen,  ...  it  was  not  required  to  prove
that  appellants  knew where  it  was  stolen.'28  Therefore,  'it  was  not
necessary for  the government to prove that appellants knew the law
of the place of the theft.'29  Any error  in the trial judge's  instruction
was  not,  in  the  court's  opinion,  prejudicial.  After  the  criminal
convictions,  Guatemala  sued  to  recover  the  stela  and  the  court
ordered its return.30 Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals
felt any need to parse the actual language of the Guatemalan laws.31
The criminal case engendered comment mainly for  its  integration
of Guatemalan  law as the basis for  the criminal  conviction  of U.S.
citizens  for  something  not  a  crime  under  the  laws  of  the  United
States.32 The case, however, is not really that remarkable. Guatemala
had  declared  ownership  of  this  class  of  monuments,  the  stela  had
been  documented  in situ  and  it  was  now  outside  the  territory  of
Guatemala  without  the  knowledge  or  permission  of  the  sovereign.
This, the court  found,  was sufficient  for  the imposition  of criminal
liability.

It  should  be  noted  that,  because  the  stela  was  connected  with  a
documented  site,  had  the  1970  UNESCO  Convention  been  appli-
cable, the stela would  have fallen  within Article 7(b) of the Conven-
tion and  any signatory  nation  would have been bound  to return  the
object  once  seized.33  While  the  United  States  had  not  yet  imple-
mented  the  UNESCO  Convention  in  1974, the  Senate  had  ratified
the  UNESCO  Convention 
the
UNESCO  Convention  in 1985.35

in  1972.34  Guatemala  ratified 

The statement  by the Court  of Appeals, that it was not necessary
that the defendant  know the provisions  of the foreign  law, has been
limited by the language  of the McClain  and Johnson cases. At base,
Hollinshead today  stands  for  the  proposition  that  U.S. courts  will
allow  both  criminal  and  civil  suits  to  insure  the  return  of  cultural
property documented  in situ without requiring an in depth examina-
tion of the  terms  of the foreign  law.36

3  Part  II
United States  v. McClain

McClain was  the  second  important  prosecution  brought  under  the
National  Stolen  Property  Act  as  applied  to  cultural  property.37
Unlike Hollinshead, the artifacts  at  issue in McClain had never been
documented  prior  to their illegal export and it is fair to assume that
they were not  part  of  any  private  or  public  collection.

The  assumption  of  all  parties  to  the  McClain case  was  that  the
objects were either purchased  from  whoever discovered them or that
the  individuals  charged  had  excavated  the  objects  themselves  with
the  intent  to  sell  them  outside  the  country.38  The  defendants  were
arrested  while trying to  sell the objects  to various museums. One of
the  cultural  institutions  contacted  by  the  group  was  an  official
arm  of  the  Mexican  government.39  The Mexican  Cultural  Institute
contacted  the  FBI,  who  purchased  $115,000  worth  of  the  objects
leading to the charges of transportation  and  receipt of stolen goods
under  the  NSPA.40

The  McClain  court  defined  stolen  as  'any  dishonest  transaction
whereby one person obtains that which rightfully  belongs to another
and  deprives  the  owner  of  the  rights  and  benefits  of  ownership.'41
The  defendants  were  convicted  by  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the
Western  District  of  Texas.  That  decision  was  reversed  by  the U.S.
Court of Appeals for  the Fifth  Circuit  which remanded  the case for
further  proceedings  to  determine  when  the pre-Columbian  artifacts
were exported  in  light  of  the  Appeals  Court's  finding  that  the only
Mexican law that clearly declared  national ownership of all  artifacts
was that  of  1972.42

On remand,  the District  Court  again convicted  the defendants  on
the  grounds  of  violating  the  NSPA  and  conspiring  to  violate  the

U.S. Case Law on Cultural Property  Disputes

NSPA.  The  Fifth  Circuit  reversed  the  conviction  for  violation  of
the NSPA because the District Court had allowed the jury to decide
the  issue  as  to  when  Mexico  had  declared  ownership,  a  question
that  is  committed  to  the  judge  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil
Procedure.43 The conspiracy  conviction  was upheld.

Unlike Hollinshead, where the court felt it unnecessary to construe
the  actual  language  of  the  Guatemalan  law  before  accepting  its
applicability,  the McClain decisions involved careful  exegesis of the
various Mexican laws. Mexico had first  enacted  a law protecting its
cultural  heritage  in  1897.  Article  1 of  the  Law  on  Archaeological
Monuments,  May  11,  1897  made  'archaeological  monuments, the
property  of  the  Nation.'44  No  one  could  'remove  them  ...  without
the  express  authorization  of  the  Executive  of  the  Union.'45  While
this  law  appeared  to  vest  ownership  of  such  monuments  in  the
government, private individuals were allowed to possess pre-Colum-
bian artifacts. The class of artifacts at issue in McClain were covered
by Article 6 of the  1897 law which provided  only for  a  prohibition
on export.46 There was nothing in this language that could  lead  the
court  to a determination  that the artifacts  were owned  by the state.
In 1930 Mexico enacted a broader statute.47 The 1930 law covered
objects  of 'artistic, archaeological  or historical value, whether mov-
able or immovable.' An object was, declared  to be a monument  if it
came under  the  auspices  of  the  Secretariat  of  Public  Education  or
was  declared  to  be  a  monument  by  the  Department  of  Artistic,
Archaeological  and  Historic  Monuments.  Monuments  were  to  be
protected,  but could  be privately  owned  and  alienated  subject  only
to  a  right  of  first  refusal  in  the  government.48  This  law  was  also
determined  not  to amount  to a declaration  of ownership.

A third law, with still broader impact, was enacted in 1934.49 The
definition  of  monuments  was  expanded  to  include  'all  vestiges  of
the  aboriginal  civilization  dating  from  before  the  completion  of
the  Conquest.'50  All  immovable  archaeological  monuments  were
declared  to belong to the nation  including 'objects  which are  found
[in  or  on] immovable  archaeological  monuments.'51  The  1934 law
continued  to  recognize  private  ownership  of  archaeological  monu-
ments. Privately owned objects had to be registered and all  transfers
were to  be recorded.52  The court  concluded  that  artifacts  found  in
or  on  immovable  monuments  were  a  subset  of  all  pre-Columbian
artifacts.  If an object  was not within the subclass it was not owned
by Mexico.

The  1934 regime continued  until  the passage of  the  Federal  Law
Concerning  Cultural  Patrimony  of  the  Nation  of  December  16,
1970.53 This law restated  the provisions  of the  1934 law and  added
an  export  prohibition  for  those  objects  that  were declared  to  form
part  of  the  Cultural  Patrimony  of  the  Nation.  Private  ownership
survived,  as did  the registration  and  recording  requirements  of  the
1934 law. Article  54 provided  that  movable  artifacts  that  were  not
'unique,  rare  specimens  or  of  exceptional  value  for  their  aesthetic

quality  or  for  their  other  cultural  qualities...  can  be  the  object  of
transfer  of  ownership.'54  Article  55  created  a  presumption  that
unregistered,  movable  archaeological  objects  'are  the  property  of
the Nation.'55  This amounted  to  a  declaration  of  ownership  in  the
state for a certain class of objects, upon  a failure to show compliance
with  the registration  requirements  of  the law.

The  final  law  considered  by  the  court  was  the  Federal  Law  on
Archaeological, Artistic and Historic Monuments and Zones of May
6,  1972.56  For  the  first  time  the  law  declared  unequivocally  that
'archaeological monuments, movables and immovables, are the inal-
ienable  and  inprescriptable  property  of  the  Nation.'57  Article  28
defined  archaeological  monuments  as  '[m]ovable  and  immovable
objects,  products  of  the  cultures  prior  to  the  establishment  of  the
Spanish culture in the National  Territory.'58  Prior to the passage of
the  1972 law, there had  been  'a  bitter constitutional  debate' regard-
ing the  validity  of extending  public  control  over  previously  private
property.59 The 1972 law 'extended  national ownership of the cultu-
ral  patrimony  to  private  collections  and  forbade  absolutely  the
export  of pre-Columbian  items.'60

The 1972 law still protected private ownership rights to the extent
these  had  been  previously  created  by  registration  under  the  1934
and  1970 laws.61 Thus, there  was a  dual ownership  system with  the
same types of  objects  owned  by  the  state  through  legislation,  or by
private  persons  through  registration.  The  Appeals  Court  held  that
before  the NSPA  could  be  applied  to  an  item,  that  item  had  to be
determined  to  be  stolen.  As the  objects  in question  had  never  been
reduced to physical possession  the court required a clear declaration
of  national  ownership.  It  rejected  the  idea  that  export  restrictions
alone  would  be  sufficient.  There  had  been  no  determination  from
the  evidence  presented  as  to  when  the  objects  had  been  exported.
'If the exportation  occurred  before  1972, but  after  the effective  date
of the 1934 law, it would  be necessary  to show that  the artifact  was
found  in  or  on  an  immovable  archaeological  monument'  for  the
article to be considered  stolen.62  'If  the exportation  occurred  before
the effective  date  of the  1934 law,  it  could not  have been owned by
the Mexican  government,  and  illegal exportation would not  subject
the receiver  of  the article  to  the  strictures  of the  NSPA.'63

On remand, the defendants were convicted on both the substantive
charge  and  the conspiracy  count.64  There was additional  testimony
on  the  five  Mexican  laws  and  a  provision  of  the  1917  Mexican
Constitution.65 The witnesses presented  by the Mexican government
testified  that,  regardless  of  the exact wording  or  specific  provisions
of  the  laws,  the  Mexican  government  had  intended  to  own  pre-
Columbian  artifacts  from  the passage  of the  1897 law.66 The expert
witness for the government of Mexico maintained that the combina-
tion of the default  ownership  provisions and  the Constitution was a
sufficient  declaration of ownership.  The defendant's  witness testified
that  the  Fifth  Circuit's  analysis  of  the  Mexican  laws  in  the  prior

U.S. Case Law on Cultural Property  Disputes

Appeals case had  been correct, that is, that  there had  been no clear
declaration  of  ownership  until  passage  of  the  1972  law.  The  trial
judge  submitted  the  resolution  of  this  conflict  in  meaning  to  the
jury-

On  this  point  the  conviction  of  the  defendants  for  violating  the
NSPA was reversed. As noted above, foreign  law, under the Federal
Rules  of  Civil Procedure  is a  question  of law  to  be decided  by  the
judge. The court  held  that  in view of the evidence  presented  in  the
trial, the jury could  have based  its conviction  of the defendants  on
the  belief  that  Mexico  had  declared  itself  owner  of  all  artifacts  as
early  as  1897.67 By doing  so,  the jury  had  applied  laws  that  were
too  vague,  when  measured  by  American  constitutional  standards,
to serve as the basis for criminal liability.68 While Mexico may have
considered itself the owner of all pre-Columbian artifacts  for almost
100  years,  the  laws  were  not  expressed  with  'sufficient  clarity  to
survive translation  into terms understandable  by and  binding upon
American  citizens.'69  The  court  held  that  '[t]he  National  Stolen
Property  Act...  cannot  be properly  applied  to  items deemed  stolen
only  on  the  basis  of  unclear  pronouncements  by  a  foreign  legis-
lature.'70

There was sufficient  evidence in the record  to  allow  the court  to
uphold the conspiracy conviction. The defendants had demonstrated
that  they  intended  to  continue  their  trafficking  in  pre-Columbian
artifacts  from  Mexico in the future.  They possessed enough  general
knowledge  of  the  post-1972  ownership  claims  to  understand  that
the objects would be considered  stolen by the Mexican  government.
It is interesting to note that the prosecution was unable to present
evidence as to how or when the objects in dispute had been acquired
in  Mexico,  or  even  as  to  whether  Mexico  was  in  fact  the  country
of origin.71 The initial District Court decision appeared  to place the
burden  of proof  on the defendant  to demonstrate  the source of the
artifacts  and  the date  of export.  This was rejected  by  the  Court  of
Appeals and the burden of proving origin has remained  consistently
with the sovereign  in later cases.

In retrospect, it is questionable whether the conspiracy convictions
should  have  been  sustained  without  some  determination  of  the
origin  of the objects. As is clear in the Johnson decision,  the courts
will now require the prosecution/plaintiff  to demonstrate two things:
first,  that  the foreign  law provides a clear declaration  of  ownership
by the sovereign and second, that the items were initially discovered
or  documented  within  the jurisdiction  of  the  sovereign  to  ensure
that  the proper  nation's law is being  recognized.

McClain has  been  interpreted  in  radically  different  ways  by  dif-
ferent  groups. Prosecutors and  the Customs Service have chosen  to
interpret  McClain  as  introducing  the  proposition  that  forfeiture
upon illegal export vests ownership in the foreign sovereign.72 Under
this  interpretation,  illegal  export  of  cultural  property  transforms
that property into stolen property. Not surprisingly, art dealers have

interpreted  McClain  somewhat  differently.  As stated  in  the amicus
brief  filed  in  the  Swetnam  proceeding,  McClain  stands  for  the
proposition  that:

Export  restrictions  guard...  jurisdiction  [over  property]  and
power  [to  regulate  its  use  or  disposition].  But,  except  for  this
effect  on jurisdiction,  restrictions  on  exportation  are just  like
any other police power restrictions. They do not 'create owner-
ship'  in  the  state.  The state comes to  own property  only when
it acquires such property in the general manner by which private
persons  come  to  own  property,  or  when  it  declares  itself  the
owner...73

Courts  following  McClain  appear  to  have  accepted  the  position
articulated  by the art  dealers.

It  should  be noted  that  at  the  time  of  the  McClain decisions the
United  States  and  Mexico  had  already  signed  a  treaty  committing
each  country  to  'employ  the  legal  means  at  its  disposal  to  recover
and  return  ...  stolen  ...  cultural  property.' 74  The Attorney  General
of  the United  States  is  authorized  to  institute  civil proceedings  for
the return  of  such  property.  The treaty  pre-dates  the  1972 Mexican
law  and  therefore  would  not  incorporate  that  law  as  the  basis  for
a  determination  that  specific  cultural  property  had  been  stolen.75
Further, the Treaty is limited to property deemed to be 'of  outstand-
ing importance  to  the  national  patrimony.'76  Arguably  the kind  of
objects at issue in McClain would not have fallen within the Treaty's
purview.

4  Part  III
United States  v. Swetnam,  Peru v.  Johnson

In  United States  v. Swetnam,  the Customs Service initially seized the
disputed  artifacts  under  a  host  of customs and  criminal  regulations
including  18  U.S.C.  §  371  (conspiracy  to  commit  offense  or  to
defraud  the United  States); § 542 (entry of goods by means of  false
statements); § 545 (smuggling  goods into  the United  States); § 1001
(statements  or entries  generally); §§2314 and  2315 (National  Stolen
Property  Act);  and  Title  19  U.S.C.  § 1595  (searches  and  seizures)
and  § 2606 (import  restrictions)  (Cultural  Property  Implementation
Act).  The  indictment  against  Swetnam,  a  dealer  in  pre-Columbian
artifacts,  was  limited  to  18 U.S.C. § 2 (aiding and  abetting), §  371,
§  545,  and  §  1001. The  NSPA  charges  were  dropped,  presumably
owing  to  the  difficulty  of  proving  ownership  by  Peru  on  the  basis
of Peruvian  law.77 Swetnam  pleaded  guilty to smuggling and  aiding
and  abetting.  He  was  able  to  reclaim  the  majority  of  the  artifacts
confiscated  by  the  Customs  Service  except  for  pieces  that  were
returned  to  the  Peruvian  government  as part  of a settlement agree-

ment.78  The  exact  disposition  of  the  majority  of  the  artifacts  is
unclear.

The civil case brought  by Peru against  Benjamin  Johnson,  an  art
dealer,  was  resolved  in  Johnson's  favor  on  the  ground  that  Peru
failed  sustain its burden of proving that it was entitled to the return
of the objects.79 The decision  in Johnson  should  be contrasted  with
the  failure  of  any  of  the  McClain decisions  to  address  or  resolve
what  would  seem  to  be  a  very  important  precondition  to  bringing
suit  in  American  courts,  namely  demonstrating  standing  based  on
having suffered  an injury  in fact.  If the sovereign never knew of the
existence  of  the  objects  and  cannot  prove  that  the  objects  were
excavated  within its territory, it has suffered  no actual  injury  when
such  objects  enter  the  stream  of  commerce  outside  the  nation's
borders.  If the sovereign  has not documented  or actually  possessed
the objects in question, it must demonstrate that it has at least 'done
something'  to  exercise  ownership  rights  in  the  objects.  Enforcing
penalties  and  sanctions  against  nationals  who  violate  the  domestic
laws  is one  way  of  demonstrating  that  the  sovereign  had  met  this
'do something' requirement.80 The conclusion drawn by at least one
commentator  is that  Peruvian  nationals may not  have been  subject
to  penalties  or  sanctions  for  failure  to  comply  with  their  own
national  laws.81  U.S.  courts  should  be  leery  of  enforcing  foreign
laws  in  this  country  without  a  clear  demonstration  that  the  same
laws  are  given  effect  domestically.  Moreover,  the  Peruvian  expert
witness,  while  able  to  identify  the  items  as  recognizable  examples
of  Peruvian  pre-Columbian  culture could  not  link  the  objects  with
a  particular  site  in  Peru.82  The  defendant,  however,  was  able  to
produce  export  certificates  showing  that  he  had  purchased  the
disputed  items in  good  faith  over  the  course  of  several  years  from
various countries.83 Therefore,  Peru's claim  to superior  title  failed.
The court, in dicta, went on to analyze the Peruvian laws in detail.
The  first  law  examined  was  Law  No.  6634  of  June  13,  1929.84
The  Peruvian  government's  interpretation  was  that  the  1929  law
provided  that archaeological  objects found  before  1929 belonged  to
the finder  while objects  found  after  that  date belonged  to the state.
Privately  owned pre-Columbian  artifacts  were to  be registered  in a
book  maintained  at  the National  Museum  of  History.85  An  object
not so registered after  one year, beginning on the day the book was
opened,  was considered  to  be property  of  the  state. The  court  was
unable  to  determine  from  the  evidence  presented  whether  such  a
book  had  ever been  opened.86

The 1929 law remained in effect  until it was repealed and replaced
by  Law  No.  24047 on  January  5,  1985.87 After  the  passage  of  this
law,  private  persons  were  required  to  register  their  archaeological
objects. If an owner did not comply with this registration obligation,
the  law  could be  interpreted  to  mean  that  the  objects  belonged  to
the state.88

The President  of Peru  issued  a Supreme  Decree on  February 27,
1985 that  proclaimed  pre-Hispanic  artistic  objects  belonging  to  the

nation's  cultural  wealth  were  untouchable  and  their  removal  from
the country was categorically forbidden.89  The trial court considered
this language  too  vague  to  be a declaration  of  state ownership. On
June  22, 1985 a  statute  provided  specifically  that  all  archaeological
sites  belonged  to  the  state.90 It  was the contention  of  the  Peruvian
witness  that  this meant  that  a private  person  who dug at  a site and
excavated  its  objects  would  be  taking  someone  else's  property.91
The  law  does  not  appear  to  claim  as  state  property  objects  not
found  at  an  archaeological  site. This leaves a potentially  large class
of  objects  within  the  domain  of  private  ownership.92  The  court,
reading  the  Supreme  Decree  and  statute  together  determined  that
any  artifacts  privately  excavated  between  January  5 and  June  22,
1985 would  constitute  private  property.93

While the laws of  Peru  asserted  the interest  of the government in
preserving  its  cultural  heritage  and  prohibiting  the  export  of  arti-
facts,  this  assertion  was  not equivalent  to  a declaration  of  national
ownership.94  The  1929  law  that  pronounced  60th  historical  monu-
ments  and  unregistered  artifacts  property  of  the  state,  did  not
preclude  possession  of  artifacts  by private  parties  and  their  subse-
quent  transfer.  There  was no  testimony  that  Peru  had ever tried  to
exercise  its  laws  against  its  own  citizens  as  long  as  the  objects
remained  within  Peruvian  territory.  The court  thus  concluded  that
the  effect  of  the  laws  was  that  they  amounted  to  restrictions  on
export.  Citing  McClain  for  the proposition  that  export  restrictions
do not create ownership,95 the court found  the Peruvian laws lacked
sufficient  clarity  to  be understandable  by and  binding upon Ameri-
can citizens.96

In  United States  v.  Swetnam  and Peru v. Johnson the United  States

and  Peruvian  governments  tried  to convict alleged  smugglers under
U.S.  laws  and  return  to  Peru  objects  claimed  to  be  stolen  and
illegally exported  in violation  of Peruvian  laws. While Swetnam did
plead guilty to a smuggling  charge and was sentenced to six months
in prison,97 most of the disputed artifacts remained with their current
possessors. These cases raise many questions about the  effectiveness
of  such  lawsuits  when  compared  to  legislative  solutions  to  the
problem  of  illicit  trade  in cultural  property.

Peru  and  the  United  States  have  signed  an  executive  agreement
entitled  Respecting the Recovery and Return of Stolen Archaeologi-
cal,  Historical  and  Cultural  Properties.98  In  June  1989,  Peru  re-
quested  the imposition  of import  restrictions under  Section 2603 of
the  Cultural  Property  Implementation  Act99  for  artifacts  from  the
Sipan  II  site.100 The  request  was granted  in May  1990.101

U.S. Case Law on Cultural  Property  Disputes

tators  have  noted  repeatedly  that  the  illegal  export  of  cultural
property  does  not  affect  the  property's  legal  importation  into  a
second  jurisdiction.  The  strength  of  that  proposition  was  initially
tested  in  Jeanneret  v.  Vichey.

The question facing the court was this: did the claim of the Italian
government  — that  a  painting  had  been  illegally  removed  from
Italian  territory  by  the  legal  owner  of  the  painting  —  cast  a
sufficient  cloud  on  the title  of a subsequent  bona fide purchaser  so
as to allow the bona fide purchaser  to rescind  the sale for  breach of
warranty  of title.

The  trial  court  held  that  the jury  could  easily  have  determined
that the Italian government had made a legitimate claim on the title
of the painting.102  The court cited U.C.C. § 2-312  that  'there  is in
a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that  ... the title conveyed
shall  be  good.'103  The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit
reversed and remanded  for  a clearer determination  of the law to be
applied.  While  ducking  both  the  narrow  issue  and  the  broader
implications  of  the  question,104  the  Court  of  Appeals  refuted  the
proposition  that  the Italian  government  could  seize the painting or
hold  the  bona fide purchaser  responsible  for  any fines or  penalties
arising  out of the illegal  export.105

In  Vichey the  defendant,  Anna  Vichey,  who  was  an  American
citizen, had inherited a one third interest in a Matisse painting  from
her  father  in  1970.106  The  painting  was  part  of  an  extensive  and
internationally recognized collection belonging to her father,  located
in Milan, Italy. A letter from  Bank Gut  Streiff  in Zurich dated July
24,  1970  indicated  that  the  painting  had  been  deposited  with  the
bank  by  that  date.107  There  was  uncontroverted  proof  that  no
export  license  or  permit  had  ever  been  obtained  from  the  Italian
government.108

Mme. Vichey  and  her  husband  sold  the  painting  to  Mme.  Jean-
neret,  an  internationally  known  Swiss art  dealer,  in  1973. In  1974
Mme. Jeanneret  was informed  that  the  Italian  government  consid-
ered the painting to have been illegally exported.109  Mme. Jeanneret
maintained that because of this she was no longer able to sell or show
the painting and proposed  returning  the painting to the Vicheys for
repayment  of the purchase price.110 The Vicheys refused  and  Mme.
Jeanneret instituted suit for breach of express and implied warranties
of  title,  false  and  fraudulent  misrepresentation,  breach  of  contract
and  a claim  that  the  defendant  had  used  the  plaintiff  as  part  of a
tax evasion  scheme.111

Much  of  the  testimony  heard  by  the  trial  court  involved  two
different  sets of  provisions  of  Italian  law  that  governed  the  export
requirements relating to works of art. The earliest were the Regula-
tions for  the Execution of Law No. 364 of June 20, 1909, Approved
by Royal Decree No. 363 of January 30,1913.112 Article 129 required
'anyone desiring  to export  objects  of  historical, archaeological,  pa-
leontological,  artistic  or  numismatic  interest  to  present  them  to  a

royal  office  for  the  exportation  of  antiquities  and  art  objects.'113
Persons seeking export licenses had to file a declaration of the value
of  the  objects  to  be exported.  Government  officials  then  inspected
the objects  and could ban their export or purchase the items for  the
Italian  government  at their  declared  value.114

A second provision of the 1913 regulations, Article 130, provided

that:

Paintings, sculpture and any works of art made by living artists
or not more than 50 years old, including copies and imitations,
must be submitted to Export Offices  or to the offices  specifically
set  up  pursuant  to  Art.  46 of  Law  No.  386 of  June  27, 1907,
in order  to obtain  an export  permit.115

The permit requirements were more informal  than  the license requi-
rements and primarily fiscal  in character. There was no requirement
of a declaration of value and the export officer  was without authority
to deny a permit. Penalties for  non-compliance included  a fine, and
seizure of the  objects until  the exporter paid  the  storage and  trans-
port expenses.116

The second  set of provisions dated  from  1939.117 Article  1 of the
1939  law lists  the  same  types  of  objects  covered  by  Article  129 of
the  1913  regulations.  Works  by  living  artists,  or  works  not  more
than  50  years  old  are  specifically  excluded  from  the  1939  law's
coverage.118

Article 2 the  1939 law sets up a notification  process by which the
Minister  of Public Instruction  gives administrative notice to owners
of  works  enumerated  in  Article  1 that  the  works  are  of  particular
interest to the Italian government. This notice was considered  to be
binding  on  any  successor  in  ownership,  holder  or  possessor  of  a
beneficial  interest  in a work  of  art.119

Article  35  prohibited  the  export  of  objects  covered  in  Article 1
provided  that  the items were  of 'such  importance  that  their  export
would  represent  a  tremendous  loss  to  the  national  patrimony.'120
Anyone  who  wished  to  export  Article  1 type  objects  had  to  apply
for a license and declare the market value of each object as provided
in  Article  36.  Any  disputes  as  to  value  would  be  resolved  by  the
Minister  of  Public  Instruction.  Objects  of  particular  interest  could
be purchased  by the Ministry  within two months of the  determina-
tion  of  the  object's value.121

Article 61 renders null and void any transfer made without compli-
ance  with  the  procedural  requirements  of  the  1939  law.122  Fines
are  provided  for  and  confiscation  of  the  object  under  regulations
pertaining  to  smuggled  goods  is  permitted.123  If  the  item  has  left
Italy  or  cannot  be  traced,  the  transgressor  is  required  to  pay  the
stated  value of  the item.124

Because  the  1939 law  expressly  excluded  works  by  living  artists
or  works  less  than  50 years  old,  the  question  arose  as  to  whether

U.S. Case Law on Cultural Property  Disputes

Article  130 of  the  1913 regulations  survived  to  govern  such  works
or  whether  the  1939  law  superseded  the  1913  regulations  thereby
leaving such  works unregulated.  Article  73 of the  1939 law entitled
'Transitional  Provisions' was found  to control:  '[T]he provisions of
the regulations approved under Royal Decree No. 363(3) of January
30, 1913, shall remain in force, in so far  as they are applicable until
such  time  as  the  regulations  to  be  issued  in  execution  of  this  law
take  effect.'125

There was conflicting  testimony  as to the effect  of this provision
between  those experts who felt  that  only the provisions  of the 1913
regulations  dealing with  works within  the  scope  of Article  1 of  the
1939 law  survived;  a  position  that  resulted  in  the  free  exportation
of works of living artists or works less than  50 years old, and  those
who  felt  that  such  portions  of  the  1913  regulations  that  did  not
conflict  with the  1939 law remained in force. This would mean  that
the informal fiscal provisions requiring only a permit would continue
to  apply  to  such works.126

Almost  ten  years  after  the  export  of  the  Matisse  painting,127  on
March 28, 1979, the Assistant  Minister of Culture issued a  notifica-
tion  pursuant  to  Article  3 of  the  1939  law  declaring  the  painting
to  be  'of  particular  artistic  and  historical  interest'  to  the  Italian
government  and 'therefore  subject  to the 1939 regulations.'128 Penal
proceedings  were  instituted  against  Anna  Frau  DeAngeli  (Vichey),
Interpol  was requested  to recover  the painting and  the Chief of the
Italian Delegation for  Retrieving Works of Art was asked to present
the request of the Italian government to the United States authorities
to  assist  in  returning  the  painting.129  In  view  of  the  efforts  of  the
Italian  government  and  uncontradicted  testimony  of  several  art
dealers  that  the  painting  could  not  be resold  the  Court  of  Appeals
was  hard  pressed  to  reach  its  determination  that  in  fact  no  cloud
on  title could  be said  to exist.130

The rationale of the decision lies in the court's citation  of Profes-
sor  Bator's  article  that  declared  'the  fundamental  general  rule'  to
be  that  'illegal  export  does  not  itself  render  the  importer  (or  one
who  took  from  him)  in  any  way  actionable  in  a  U.S.  court;  the
possession  of  an  art  object  cannot  be  lawfully  disturbed  in  the
United  States solely because  it was illegally  exported  from  another
country.'131  Although  in  this case the  rule penalized  the good  faith
purchaser,  it  is not  hard  to  imagine  the  widespread  effect  on com-
mercial  transactions  involving  the  sale  of  art  had  the  lower  court
decision  been  allowed  to  stand.132

Nowhere  did  the  applicable  Italian  laws  declare  such  objects  as
the  painting  in  question  to  be  state  property.  None  of  the  Italian
regulations  appeared  to  extend  their  reach  to  bona fide  purchasers
provided  the painting  was never  returned  to  Italy.133 The  Court  of
Appeals  disagreed  with  the  trial  court's  instruction  that  if  the
painting was ever returned  to Italy, the 'owner, even if he purchased
the painting in good  faith,  could  be required  to pay customs duties

and/or  fines.'134  On  the  contrary,  the  Court  of  Appeals  found
nothing  in  the  Italian  law  that  imposed  any  such  liability  on  the
purchaser  as  opposed  to  the  exporter.  The  court  also  determined
that  no  government,  including  the  U.S. government,  would  act  on
Italy's  request  for  help in  securing  the return  of  the painting.135

It can certainly be argued that  any geographic limitation on resale
reduces  the  value  of  the  item  on  the  worldwide  art  market.136  In
looking  at  the effect  of its decision,  however,  the Court  of Appeals
was  clearly  correct  in  determining  that  a  decision  to  grant  to  the
uncertain Italian laws the power  to create a cloud on title would be to
give the laws effect  beyond  normal  understanding  and the generally
recognized  territorial  limitations  on national  legislation.137

Jeanneret  reaffirms  the  position  that  the  Customs  laws  of  one
country  are  not  effective  in  the  courts  of  another.138  As decided  in
Attorney  General of  New  Zealand  v.  Ortiz,™  when  a  regulation
amounts  to  a  restriction  on  export,  the  government  must  actually
seize the object  before  it leaves  the jurisdiction  to vest ownership in
the  government.140

6  Part  V  — Conclusion

Commercial  transactions  involving  cultural  property  can  be highly
uncertain.  In  considering  the  conflict  between  the  rights  of  the
original  owner  and  the  bona fide  purchaser,  U.S. courts  have  tried
to  effect  a  balance  by  treating  a  thief  in  the  chain  of  title  as  an
absolute  bar  against  subsequent  purchasers  and  otherwise  support-
ing the  free  transferability  of  property.

The  Hollinshead approach,  extends  the  traditional  common  law
rule,  nemo dat  quod non habet141  to  characterize  as  'stolen'  objects
declared  owned  by  statute  as  long  as  those  objects  have  been
discovered  and documented.  McClain  rejected  any further  extension
to  undiscovered  objects  without  a  painstaking  examination  of  the
foreign  ownership  laws measured  by American  constitutional  stan-
dards. McClain specifically  rejected  the notion that a general knowl-
edge  of  the  foreign  sovereign's  intent  was  sufficient  for  imposing
criminal  liability.

Criminal  prosecutions  may  have continued  limited application  in
a  narrow  range  of  cases  where: (1) there  exists  a  clear  declaration
of ownership by the sovereign  measured  by American constitutional
standards; (2) the particular  items  in question  have been reduced  to
possession, documented  in situ or there has been some manifestation
by the sovereign of the intent  to exercise dominion and control over
the class of object;  and  (3) the  defendant  has acted with  scienter  —
guilty  knowledge  that  his  taking  of  the  object  was  in  violation  of
another's  rightful  claim  of  ownership.142  Such  prosecutions  should
be  limited  to  smugglers  and  not  be  extended  to  subsequent  pur-
chasers.

U.S. Case Law on Cultural Property  Disputes

Civil  suits  for  replevin  have  wider  applicability.  Here  Peru  v.
Johnson provides  the  clearest  statement  of  policy.  The  sovereign
must  show: (1) it has made  a clear declaration  of ownership  meas-
ured  by  American  constitutional  standards;  (2)  in  regard  to  the
particular  items, the sovereign must have manifested  some effort  at
dominion  or  control  beyond  the  legislative  declaration;  and  (3)
the  current  possessor's  detention  must  be wrongful.143  If  a  foreign
sovereign  meets  these  criteria  the  object  should  be  returned  as
the  sovereign  has  proven  superior  title  and  right  to  immediate
possession.144

In  the  case where  the  plaintiff  fails  to  convince  the  trier  of  fact
of  the merits  of its  claim,  for  example  a  sovereign  fails  to  demon-
strate  the  clarity  of  its  laws  and  its  efforts  at  enforcement,  the
defendant  should  retain  ownership  without  examination  into  the
good  faith  of  the purchaser.145  Where  there  is no  clear  declaration
of  ownership,  that  is, where  the  national  legislation  amounts  to  a
restriction on the power of alienation or exportation  the courts will
not  give  effect  to  the  foreign  jurisdiction's  laws  to  disturb  the
possession  of the current  owner.

There has yet to be a definitive determination as to whether equity
will  intervene  if  the  common  law  rule  creates  undue  hardship  for
the  bona fide purchaser  or  whether  the  prevailing  plaintiff  should
be required  to compensate  the  defendant  for  the  purchase  price of
the  object.  It  is  also  unclear  how  the  courts  will  interpret  the
Cultural  Property  Implementations  Act  provisions  pertaining  to
documentation  and  repose.146 While no U.S. court  has yet done so,
this  is  certainly  an  area  where  international  conventions,  such  as
the Preliminary Draft UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally
Exported  Cultural  Objects,  could  be  considered  indicative  of
national consensus and used as persuasive authority  by the court in
reaching  its  decision.147  Any  purchaser  would  be  well  advised  to
seek  not  only  the  necessary  export  documents  but  assurance  that
there  is an  clear  chain  of  title.  Museums  and  private  parties  inter-
ested  in acquiring  works  of cultural  property  are  the cheapest  cost
avoiders  of  lawsuits  to  establish  clear  title.  Those  who  ignore  this
duty  of due diligence do so at  their peril.148

There  are  two  factors  that  will  insure  the U.S. courts  continued
involvement with cases determining the disposition of cultural prop-
erty.  The  first  is  the  depth  and  variety  of  the  legitimate  U.S.  art
market.  Maintaining  both  the integrity  and  stability  of this  market
is an  important  consideration  in any cultural property dispute. The
second  is  the  openness  of  U.S. courts  to  suits  by  non-citizens  and
the  existence  of  legal  rules  that  work  to  protect  the  interests  of
either  the  original  owner  or  a  bona fide purchaser  depending  on
the  context.  Nations  whose  laws  strongly  favor  the  security  of
transactions will not be seen as a hospitable forum by a dispossessed
owner.  In  fashioning  rules  of  law  to  govern  private  conduct  U.S.
courts should be aware of the need to maintain the particular  points
of stability  identified  above within  the evolving doctrine.

Sevso  Treasure,  from  the  fourth  or  fifth  century  A.D..  The  Marquess  of
Northampton  claims  the  right  to  sell  the  silver  through  Sothebys.  The
governments  of  Lebanon,  Yugoslavia  and  Hungary  are  each  seeking  to
establish  title  to  the  treasure.  In  May  1990  a  preliminary  injunction  was
granted  barring  defendants  from  transferring  possession  or  ownership  of
the Sevso Treasure or transporting it outside of New York City. See  Tainted
Treasure, New  York  Times,  Friday,  June  26,  1992, at  C19.

3  Republic  of  Turkey  v.  The  Metropolitan  Museum  of  Art,  762  F.Supp. 44
(S.D.N.Y.  1990).  Turkey  is  suing  the  Metropolitan  for  the  return  of  over
200  gold  and  silver  objects  that  the  Museum  purchased  during  the  1960's
which Turkey claims were illegally excavated and exported from  its territory.
A motion  for  summary judgment by the Museum was denied and  discovery
is  proceeding.

4  Art  works  and  antiquities  form  separate  but  overlapping classes of objects.
For  simplicity,  both  types of objects will be referred  to by the broader  term
'cultural  property'.  The  terminology  used  in  discussing  cultural  property
reflects  differing  ideological  points  of  view  regarding  such  property.  The
use of  the  term  'property'  has  been  questioned  by  those  who  feel  that  it is
not  sufficiently  broad  to encompass the range of items for which  protection
is  sought,  such  as  folklore:  Prott,  General Report  on  the  Protection of the
Cultural  Heritage  13th  International  Congress  of  Comparative  Law,  1990,
at  15 — 16.  'Heritage'  may  provide  an  alternative  term,  which  has  the
additional  advantage  of  not  carrying  along  with  it  either  civil  law  or
common  law  legacies  of  property  rules.  For  a  discussion  of  terminology,
see John  Henry  Merryman,  Protection of  Cultural "Heritage"?,  38 Am.  J.
Comp.  L.  513  (1990).  Because  all  of  the  cases  discussed  in  this  article
involved  tangible  objects  the  term  property  is appropriate.

5  In  addition  to  the  cases  previously  noted,  Turkey  has  also  instituted  suit
against  William  Koch  seeking  the  return  of  ancient  coins  known  as  the
Decadrachm  Hoard.  For  a  background  of  this  case,  see  Acar  &  Kaylan,
The Hoard  of  the  Century, Connoisseur,  July  1988.

U.S. Case Law on Cultural Property  Disputes

Whoever  transports  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce  any  goods,
wares,  merchandise,  securities  or  money,  of  the  value  of  $5,000  or
more,  knowing  the  same  to  have  been  stolen,  converted  or  taken  by
fraud  ...  [s]hall  be  fined  not  more  than  $10,000  or  imprisoned  not
more  than  ten  years or  both.

Section  4 provided  in  part:

Whoever  receives,  conceals,  stores,  barters,  sells  or  disposes  of  any
goods,  wares,  or  merchandise  ...  of  the  value  of  $5,000  or  more  ...
moving  as,  or  which  are  a  part  of,  or  which  constitute  interstate  or
foreign  commerce,  knowing  the same to  have  been  stolen,  unlawfully
converted,  or  taken  ...  [s]hall  be  fined  not  more  than  $10,000  or
imprisoned  not  more  than  ten  years or  both.

The National  Stolen  Property  Act was designed  to  help state  governments
manage problems such  as interstate  car  theft.  It is doubtful  the  statute was
ever  intended  to  reach  art  stolen  pursuant  to  a  foreign  ownership  law. See

30  The  disposition  of  the  Stela  was  decided  in  United  States  v.  One  Pre-
Columbian  Artifact,  known  as  "Machaquila  Stela  II"  of  Mayan  Origin,
Clive  Hollinshead,  Claimant,  U.S.D.C.  Central  District  of  California,  No.
CV73-2349-FW  (1975). The  Government  of Guatemala  allowed  the  stela
to  be  exhibited  at  the  Los  Angeles  County  Museum  for  one  year  where  it
was restored  before  being  returned.

31  A related case involved  Machaquila  Stela V. This case, brought in Arkansas,
resulted  in a plea of guilty and  a fine of $2,500. See Duboff,  The  Deskbook
of  Art  Law  94 (1977).

32  As  one  commentator  noted:  'The  stolen  character  of  the  stela  was  estab-
lished  under  the  law  of  Guatemala.  It  cannot  be  doubted  that  the  stolen
character  of  the  goods  is an  essential  element  of  a  violation  of  18 U.S.C.
§  2314.  Solely  with  reference  to  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  the  acts
committed  by  Hollinshead  and  Fell  within  the  territory  of  the  United
States  were  not  of  an  unlawful  character.  Transporting  Mayan  artifacts  in
interstate  commerce  is not  a  crime  in  the  United  States.  It  is only  through
reference  to Guatemalan  criminal law that  such an act can be characterized
as  criminal.'  Hughes,  supra,  note  18  at  166.  The  result  in  Hollinshead
appears  to  contravene  a  basic  understanding  in  international  law  that  one
nation  will  not  enforce  the criminal  laws of another;  The Antelope, 23 U.S.

declarations  of  national  ownership  of such  objects.  For  a  discussion  of the
decision, see Merryman,  Limits  on State  Recovery of Stolen Artifacts: Peru

80  The  'do  something'  requirement  flows  from  provisions  in  the  UNESCO
Convention  requiring  signatories  to  establish  national  services  and  carry
out national inventories of protected property. UNESCO Convention, supra
note  33,  art.  5.  Even  if  the  court  was  convinced  that  the  sovereign  had
done  all  it  could  be  expected  to  do  to  establish  its  ownership,  a  second
question  arises. Will  the prosecution  of  American  citizens  or  the  return  of
particular  items  redress  the  injury  suffered?  In  many  instances  officials  of
the  foreign  government  are  instrumental  in  aiding  the  illicit  traffic  in
cultural  property. See MacDonald,  Guarding Mexico's  Treasures Patrimony

leaking  out  of  every  state  in  Mexico  with  the  help  of  everyone  from

99  The Cultural  Property  Implementation  Act implements the UNESCO  Con-
vention  in  the  United  States.  Section  2603  allows  the  United  States  to
impose  import  restrictions  unilaterally  in  cases  of  emergency.  Emergency
restrictions  require that  the requesting State Party demonstrate: (1) that  the
material  to  be  protected  is  both  a  newly  discovered  type  of  material  that
is  important  to  understanding  the  history  of  mankind  and  is  in  jeopardy
from  pillage,  dismantling  or  fragmentation;  (2)  the  material  comes  from
any  site  recognized  to  be  of  high  cultural  significance  that  is  in  jeopardy
from  pillage,  dismantling,  dispersal  or  fragmentation  that  has  reached  or
threatens  to  reach  crisis  proportions;  or  (3)  the  material  is  part  of  the
remains  of  a  particular  culture  or  civilization,  the  record  of  which  is  in
jeopardy  from  pillage,  dismantling,  dispersal  or  fragmentation  that  has
reached  or  threatens  to  reach  crisis  proportions.  19  U.S.C.  §  2603

103  N.Y.U.C.C.  §  2-312(1)  (McKinney  1964).  The  statutory  section  in  full

provides:

(1)  Subject  to subsection  (2) there  is in a contract  for  sale a  warranty
by  the  seller  that

(a)  the  title conveyed  shall be good,  and  its transfer  rightful;  and
(b)  the goods  shall  be delivered  free  from  any  security  interest  or
other  lien  or  encumbrance  of  which  the  buyer  at  the  time  of  the
contracting  has  no  knowledge.

(2)  A warranty  under  subsection  (1) will be excluded or modified  only
by  specific  language  or  by circumstances  which  give the buyer  reason
to  know  that  the  person  selling does not  claim  title  in  himself  or  that
he is purporting  to  sell only such  right  or  title as he or  a  third  person
may  have.
(3)  Unless  otherwise  agreed  a  seller  who  is  a  merchant  regularly
dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered
free  of  the  rightful  claim  of any  third  person  by  way  of  infringement
or  the  like but  a  buyer  who furnishes  specifications  to  the  seller  must
hold  the  seller  harmless  against  any  such  claim  which  arises  out  of
compliance with  the  specifications.

The  Official  Comment  on  this section  states  in  part:

(1)  Subsection  (1) makes provision for a buyer's basic needs in respect
to  a  title  which  he  in  good  faith  expects  to  acquire  by  his  purchase,
namely,  that  he  receive  a  good,  clean  title  transferred  to  him  also  in
a  rightful  manner  so that  he will  not  be exposed  to  a  lawsuit  in  order
to  protect  it.

104  As  noted  by  one commentator,  the  narrow  legal  question  in  the  case  was
'whether  the Italian  government's  threats to confiscate  an  illegally  exported
work  of  art  or  to  fine  its  owner  constitute  a  sufficiently  substantial  cloud
on  title to  support  a  buyer's claim of breach  of the warranty  of title...  The
broader  underlying  issue  is  whether  any  exporting  nation,  by  threatening
actual  or  potential  owners with fines or confiscation,  can  cloud  the  title  of
or  impair  the  marketability  of  a  work  exported  without  the  approval  of

119  Ibid.  Under  this  type  of  regulation,  the  government  attempts  to  monitor
the  whereabouts  of  an  object  while  allowing  private  possession.  Such
laws  obviously  reduce  the  marketability  of  noticed  objects.  There  was  no
discussion  in the case as to how often  this procedure was actually  followed.
120  Ibid.  This  represents  an  effort  to  limit  the law  qualitatively  so  as to  avoid

creating  a  blanket  export  prohibition.

necessary,  as  a  universally  marketable  asset.  If  a  seller  cannot  guarantee
title  the  world  over  the  painting's  market  value  will  diminish  as  those
potential  buyers  affected  by  government  sanctions  cease  to  bid  against
those  unaffected  buyers  who  continue  to  value  the  painting  highly.'

137  Mme.  Vichey  has  instituted  suit  against  Mme.  Jeanneret  for  damages

complaints  filed  by Jeanneret  in  Switzerland  and  Italy;  as  well as  damages
allegedly  caused  by  Jeanneret's  abuse  of  process  in  a  former  state  court
action and  in the federal action discussed  above.  The case is pending. Vichey

138  The  Court  of  Appeals  found  support  for  its  decision  in  Article  66  of  the

that  the  confiscation  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Customs  laws
and  regulations  pertaining  to  smuggled  goods,  which  can  only  be  done  in

140  In  Ortiz,  the  Government  of  New  Zealand  sued  for  the  return  of  carved

142  In  a  recent  case  the  United  States  was  reported  to  be considering  the  use
of  the NSPA  against the family  of Joe  T. Meador, an  American  serviceman
who  allegedly  removed  items  from  the  Quedlinburg  church  during  World
War  II.  I.R.S.  Rules on Estate  of  Stolen  Treasures,  New  York  Times,  Jan.

only  that  the current  possessor  has refused  a demand  by the original owner

567  N.Y.S. 2d  623,  569  N.E.2d  426  (1991).  In  Lubell,  the  Guggenheim
Museum  sued a bona fide purchaser  who had purchased  a Chagall  gouache
in  the  1960's.  Because  the  gouache  had  been  stolen  from  the  Museum
collection,  the court  held  that  the mere lapse  of  time, no matter  how  long,
was  insufficient  to  affect  the  relative  possessory  rights  of  the  parties.  153
A.D.2d  143,  149 — 50  (1990).  In  comparison,  most  civil  law  jurisdictions
allow  some  form  of  ownership  acquired  by  prescription  after  the  requisite
number  of years. For  a discussion  of  Lubell, see Gerstenblith, Guggenheim

145  Under  general  American  practice  a  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  proving
all  the  elements  of  the  cause  of  action.  If  the  plaintiff  fails  to  sustain  its
burden  of  proof  it loses.

146  The  Cultural  Property  Implementation  Act  provides  in  section  2607  that
only articles of cultural  property  documented  as appertaining  to the inven-
tory  of  a  museum  or  religious  or  secular  public  monument  or  similar
institution  are  prohibited  from  transport  into  the  United  States.  Section
2611 provides a seies of exemptions for  articles otherwise  falling  within  the
Act, if the articles have been held  and  exhibited,  reported,  or cataloged  for
various  lengths  of  time  providing  the  purchase  was  in  good  faith  without
notice  of  violation  of  the  other  terms  of  the  Act.  19  U.S.C.  2607,  2611
