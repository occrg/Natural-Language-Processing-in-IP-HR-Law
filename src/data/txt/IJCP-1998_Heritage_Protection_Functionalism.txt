Cultural Heritage Protection:

Legitimacy, Property, and

Functionalism
markus m. mller*

This article argues that the question of whether the nation-state or the international com-
munity is the legitimate guardian of cultural property can only be answered with reference
to what we expect measures of protection of our cultural heritage to accomplish. The very con-
cept of (cid:210)protection(cid:211) is at stake, and two different schools (object-centrism versus func-
tionalism) are to be distinguished. Whereas object-centrism focuses on the cultural object
and its protection as a value in its own right, functionalism argues that the cultural her-
itage cannot even be identi(cid:222)ed as such without reference to society and its meaning for so-
cietal processes of acculturation and socialization. This article endorses functionalism and
develops a perspective that includes identity and cross-cultural communication as the
most important functions of all cultural heritage. These two criteria should guide our think-
ing about the legitimate guardian of cultural heritage in general.

there long has been discussion as to who is the legitimate guardian of
cultural property. Two diametrically opposed approaches dominate the de-
bate. On the one side, it is claimed that cultural property belongs to the
sphere of national law. We will call this approach cultural nationalism, since it
insists on the integrity of the national cultural heritage as well as state sov-
ereignty. On the other side, it has been argued that cultural property is part
of the common heritage of humankind, which also shall be the name for this ap-
proach in this article. The immense impact of politics on both approaches is
obvious. Cultural nationalism frequently uses legal instruments for the pro-
tection of cultural property as a means to pursue yet another goal(cid:209)the por-
trayal of a culture to outsiders. The second approach, which considers the
cultural heritage as belonging to all humankind, is not as idealistic as it seems
at (cid:222)rst sight. Rather, the old vision of protecting cultural objects as (cid:210)the
property of [hu]mankind at large,(cid:211) as Sir Alexander Crokes put it in 1813,1 has
been replaced by a more (cid:210)realistic(cid:211) view of the international world. This

more modern understanding of the common heritage of humankind does
not refer exclusively to issues and objects that have not yet been assigned to
one or more (speci(cid:222)c) states. It also includes another component, as Wilhelm
Kewenig argues, that reaches for international redistribution in favor of those
who were not able to afford certain goods in the past.2

The debate still lacks consensus in terms of the principles that may
guide both politics and jurisprudence. This is, of course, hardly surpris-
ing, considering the fact that (cid:210)cultural property protection(cid:211) covers various
(cid:222)elds that seem to require different perspectives. Archaeologists, museums,
gallery owners, art dealers and even churches or anthropologists are con-
cerned with issues belonging to the subject that we call cultural property
protection.  (cid:210)Culture(cid:211) is a broad term and  (cid:210)cultural property(cid:211) includes
much more than what is collected in public and private museums. A tenta-
tive clari(cid:222)cation of how the term is used in this article is presented in the
(cid:222)rst section.

When looking at answers to the question of whether cultural property
belongs to international society rather than to nation-states, one (cid:222)nds most
authorities are in agreement: both states and the international community of
states have a legitimate stake in cultural heritage protection and both may be
suitable actors on different issues. It seems that two schools of thought can
be distinguished. The (cid:222)rst, object-centrism, focuses on the primacy of the object.
Its main concern is the integrity of any cultural object or arrangement. The
second school puts the (cid:210)user(cid:211) of the cultural heritage into the center. It can
be referred to as a functionalist view of cultural heritage protection, for it
de(cid:222)nes (cid:210)cultural property(cid:211) only with reference to its function in society.

In the following section, both schools will be discussed, with an em-
phasis on their respective merits for resolving basic questions of cultural
property protection: What is cultural property? Why should it be protected?
Against what does it have to be protected? The very concept of (cid:210)protection(cid:211)
reveals its ambiguities as both schools deal with different levels of content.
Here, it will be argued that only functionalism can provide a consistent and
reliable ground for further consideration. Then, cultural nationalism and the
common heritage approaches will be described and tentatively evaluated,
with the goal of determining which school best (cid:222)ts with a functionalist view
of cultural heritage protection. The (cid:222)nal section will bring together the dif-
ferent lines of argumentation and look for some resolution.

alism?

In the history of cultural property, the two schools(cid:209)object-centrism and
functionalism(cid:209)have experienced varying levels of popularity. For a long
time, people only cared about cultural objects when they considered the
objects to have value for them. Often, the criteria were selective or biased.

artists were not considered (cid:210)collectable(cid:211) in America, and women had no
stake in art anywhere for centuries. When the art of classical Greece, Egypt,
and Rome were rediscovered, some af(cid:223)uent aristocrats began to search for
the antique, faded worlds. They started digging, and, although ancient cul-
tural treasures were discovered that are still enjoyed as jewels of eternal
value, the novice collectors certainly destroyed both objects and sources of
information in the process.

It is hardly surprising, then, that the twentieth century has witnessed a
changing view of culture and the means of its appropriate protection. As dis-
regarded artists have been rediscovered and now are seen in a different light,
archaeology itself has become more professional and cautious. The object
has been put at the center of attention and today there are even some ar-
chaeological sites that are left untouched until techniques are found that en-
sure less risky digging. Works of art and other (cid:222)nds are not only considered
as valuable treasures but also as important sources of information that pro-
vide access to the social and cultural history of humankind.

Seen from that perspective, the object-centered view might be consid-
ered  the  more  modern  approach.  It  disregards  the  possible  economic
bene(cid:222)ts cultural property may have, thus providing a sweeping frame for
protection. Of course, looking at the object just as an object is as old as pot
hunting, but pot hunting had a different aim. The object-centered view
does not consider a (cid:222)nd(cid:213)s value, whether that value be artistic, economic, or
whether the find is merely a curiosity. Instead, the integrity of the cultural
heritage, consisting of both the whole set of objects and the information
included in a given assemblage of objects, has priority.3 The preservation of
information and knowledge requires the preservation of the whole assem-
blage, thus providing, for instance, archaeology and anthropology with im-
portant sources of information. Archaeology is a prime example of the
philosophy of object-centrism. Archaeologists would prefer to leave an ob-
ject untouched rather than risking its destruction through inadequate ex-
cavation techniques. Cultural objects have a value in their own right that ex-
ists  independently  of people. The  question  of legitimate  guardianship
seems rather unimportant to this school(cid:213)s proponents because they care
only about the most effective guardian of the item.

Some proponents of the object-centered view wonder how one could
possibly determine the function of a cultural object in society. Although a
given work of art is of no importance to our society at present, it may hold
immense meaning to future generations. Taking human interest and taste as
a prime criterion means leaving the selection of the cultural heritage to sub-
jective judgments.4 Moreover, one may question whether today(cid:213)s society has
any connection to ancient (and other) cultures. Is not cultural heritage wor-
thy of preservation in its own right?

Cultural heritage protection and its legal foundation raise additional
questions: What are the goals of protecting cultural heritage? Which goals
are to be considered (cid:210)legitimate(cid:211)? These questions illustrate the problem-
atic nature of the concept of (cid:210)protection(cid:211) itself. On the one hand, (cid:210)pro-
tection(cid:211) could mean (cid:210)preservation(cid:211) as a goal in its own right. On the other
hand, (cid:210)protection(cid:211) may refer to some kind of cultural and social activity,
the intention of which is to support societal processes of acculturation and
socialization (i.e., providing tangible forms of earlier cultural and human
development). This further reveals another set of questions. What is the
cultural heritage after all? Many terms are used in academic discussions.
Most commonly, cultural property and cultural heritage appear as landmarks of
the debate. Geoffrey Lewis tried to de(cid:222)ne the (cid:222)rst concept as follows:

Cultural property represents in tangible form some of the evidence
of man(cid:213)s origins and development, his traditions, artistic and
scienti(cid:222)c achievements and generally the milieu of which he is part.
The fact that this material has the ability to communicate, either
directly or by association, an aspect of reality which transcends time
or space gives it special signi(cid:222)cance and is therefore something to be
sought after and protected.5

Lyndel Prott and Patrick O(cid:213)Keefe, however, draw a distinction between cul-
tural property and cultural heritage:

Currently the term (cid:210)cultural heritage(cid:211) is preferred as it more clearly
includes the intangible cultural heritage (folklore, crafts and skills)
not necessarily embodied in material objects but needing protection.6

Both de(cid:222)nitions are problematic. Is there any limit whatsoever that would
restrict the number of objects, ideas, skills etc., to be considered? Follow-
ing the (cid:210)maximalist solution,(cid:211) as Detlev Dicke called it,7  the answer is no.
However, if an (cid:210)object-centered(cid:211) approach is to be pursued, it is this max-
imalist solution that would be required. Since we do not want to impose
some sort of (cid:210)subjectivism(cid:211) on the selection of what we are going to pro-
tect (by whatever means), we must include all. The criteria to be applied
must be extremely broad to ensure a comprehensive reach. One wonders if
this is at all possible. Criteria must be found, and this selection will always
be(cid:209)in some sense(cid:209)human, thus imperfect. Bias is therefore a structural
necessity and will inevitably lead to a set of criteria that is not totally di-
vorced from today(cid:213)s society.

For proponents of functionalism, cultural heritage is a purely human
construction, not only because it is made by men and women but also be-
cause it is de(cid:222)ned by them. Our world is socially constructed, and so are the
meanings and functions that are assigned to objects. The function of a

Bauhaus chair in a dwelling is not what distinguishes it from a mass-produced
arm chair. However, certain (historic or aesthetic) meanings have been at-
tributed to a Corbusier sofa that make it different from a usual piece of fur-
niture. The functionalist school takes this distinction into account, when it
de(cid:222)nes (cid:210)cultural objects(cid:211) only with reference to their usage in society. At the
extreme, a functionalist does not know what cultural property is. What
makes a given object (cid:210)cultural(cid:211)(cid:209)that is, what assigns cultural signi(cid:222)cance
to it so as to legitimize an enhanced means of legal protection(cid:209)is its
meaning in society. In this sense, it does not really matter whether the na-
tional, regional, or even the international society of all people is viewed as
a point of reference. Yet these points of reference become crucial in the at-
tempt to determine for whom an object is cultural property: cultural her-
itage does not exist independently of humans; not only its substance but
also its (assigned) meaning is made by people.

What follows from the above is that cultural heritage is equated with
whatever ful(cid:222)lls the function of cultural heritage. That leads to the question
of what the functions of cultural objects in society are(cid:209)the functions in
society that should be considered legitimate and suf(cid:222)cient to justify special
legal protection. What makes cultural objects different from commercial
goods, resulting in the need for enhanced means of protection?

Two functions can be mentioned as primary. First, cultural objects
have the effect of identity-generation.8 They tell us something about history, be
it national or international, and represent the general cultural capacity of
humankind. This does not hold for all objects to the same extent; more-
over, some objects are more important (i.e., (cid:210)identity generating(cid:211)) to one
group than to another. There are quantitative differences as well. As prod-
ucts of cultural processes, cultural property offers to members of society
a means to build up personality.9 That may hold for one group or more,
but it always contributes to socialization and acculturation. Thus, cultural
heritage as a whole has an indirect impact on society; it shapes the way 
people(s) think of themselves.

The second function, usually considered the less important, is commu-
nication.10 As Ludwig Engstler wrote as early as 1964, cultural objects repre-
sent (cid:210)educational factors(cid:211) that mediate between cultural entities, occasion-
ally even promoting world peace.11 Both functions, identity generation and
communication, make up the two most important topics that may help us
determine the legitimate legal guardian.

Other aspects have to be considered as well. For instance, who will be
the most effective guardian? Which law, municipal or international, is the
appropriate one? All too easily, students of law conclude that international
law is too weak a means to be effective. Considering armed con(cid:223)icts, such
as the war in the former Yugoslavia, one might tend to agree. The ef(cid:222)cacy

of international law, however, lies not with its enforcement mechanisms but
with its normative power to shape common understandings of what is right
and wrong. Moreover, it sets standards for certain questions that simply
must be answered on the international level, since they cannot be resolved
within the spheres of national law.

The kinds of dangers from which cultural heritage should be pro-
tected also should be considered. Physical destruction and disappearance
seem to be the most important ones. Other dangers, such as the illegal
trade in art, are of a different quality: states could easily curtail this par-
ticular danger simply by legalizing all kinds of trade in art. In other words,
(cid:210)illegal trade(cid:211) is illegal because governments make it (cid:210)illegal.(cid:211)The preven-
tion of illegal trade seems to be a means to an end: to retain an overview
of the objects circulating on the world market, for example.

This essay, however, deals with the principles of legal protection of the
cultural heritage, and it explicitly intends to go to the basics. Questions of
effectiveness and the like thus can be only of secondary importance.

When looking at the motives and goals of national efforts to protect the
cultural heritage, one notices that regulations are usually justi(cid:222)ed with ref-
erence to some general sort of public interest.12 This stands in no con(cid:223)ict
whatsoever with international law since every state is sovereign to de(cid:222)ne its
cultural heritage and to set up appropriate regulation to protect it. There
has been some discussion as to whether a certain minimum requirement, a
valeur socio-culturelle essentielle pour les pays int(cid:142)ress(cid:142)s, must be met,13 but this ap-
proach still lacks widespread acceptance.

In terms of state policies, signi(cid:222)cant correlation can be seen between
the number of objects under legal protection, the quality of the respective
measures, and, (cid:222)nally, the wealth or poverty of the respective country in
terms of its cultural heritage. States that hold large numbers of cultural ob-
jects within their territory tend to have rather strict laws, apparently aiming
at keeping the cultural heritage where it is. Countries with a less af(cid:223)uent
cultural heritage, however, prefer less protectionist regulations, if any at
all.14 As to the (cid:210)quality(cid:211) of the legal measures applied, it seems that coun-
tries with strict legal regimes tend to include in their national heritage
whatever is there, disregarding the question of whether the item really (cid:210)be-
longs(cid:211) to it in a historic, aesthetic, or scienti(cid:222)c sense, or simply happens to
be there by accident. It might be argued that these policies of states, which
are rich in heritage, are understandable with regard to historical and con-
temporary patterns of loss. From a functionalist perspective, this seems,
however, to be an insuf(cid:222)cient justi(cid:222)cation.

All this indicates that (cid:210)identity(cid:211) and (cid:210)communication(cid:211) have little stake
in the cultural policies of nation-states. Rather, governments seem to care

only about their relative position on the international level: a government
with nothing to lose can afford to be liberal, while those with something to
lose do not care much about morals or issues of legitimacy. This resembles
traditional Realpolitik and seems to have little to do with re(cid:223)ected princi-
ples of law.

Inasmuch as nation-states continue to play the most important role in
international politics and have a signi(cid:222)cant impact on the self-perception of
people, one cannot dismiss (cid:210)the nation(cid:211) as a legitimate stronghold for cul-
tural property. A functionalist view would explicitly consider social groups
(i.e.,  societies)  as  those  entities  that  are  legitimate  generators  (and  thus
(cid:210)de(cid:222)ners(cid:211)) of cultural objects.15 Thus, it seems absolutely legitimate for a
nation to set up regulatory measures protecting the cultural heritage that it
has produced and that is considered part of its culture. One should ask,
therefore, whether there is something like a (cid:210)nationality(cid:211) of works of art.
Several indicators have been suggested as possible determinants for the
nationality of cultural property(cid:209)the artist(cid:213)s nationality, the geographical
residence  of the  object  in  question,  its  religious  meaning  for  a  certain
group, or its inclusion as part of a particular collection.16 This unsystematic
list has been extended by Martin Wyss, to name only one,17 but one prob-
lem remains: what is ultimately the decisive criterion? Erik Jayme has rather
convincingly argued that the nationality of cultural property is to be de-
(cid:222)ned as (cid:210)the result of the national reception of a work of art.(cid:211)18 In other
words, cultural property is considered a key to the history that symbolizes
national historical developments,19 and, as such, it receives its speci(cid:222)c mean-
ing as part of the cultural heritage. The nationality of the artist, for in-
stance, might serve as an indicator because in many cases, this factor corre-
lates with that of a work(cid:213)s historical reception. However, they can also
diverge. It is the history of reception that is crucial.

Turning now to the means of protection, two extremes can be observed.
On the one hand, some states have a general and comprehensive ban on ex-
port and disposition; on the other, there is total freedom of disposition.20
Some even have declared cultural property to be public property, while oth-
ers lack protective measures entirely.21 In between, there are different levels of
attempts to (cid:210)immobilize(cid:211) cultural property. Generally speaking, research
shows that modest regulatory approaches prove to be more effective than
sweeping action,22 a fact related to insuf(cid:222)cient control procedures for the
latter.  Moreover,  restrictive  regulations  do  not  match  a  Europe  without
frontiers,  not  to  mention  the  possibility  that  illegally  exported  cultural
property could be turned into legal property in another country.23

What can be concluded is that states do have a point when they claim
that their cultural heritage should be protected by national law. After all,
some cultural heritage has stronger links to one nation than to others. State

policies, however, often differ from the functionalist point of view. In ad-
dition  to  these  rather  guideline-oriented  arguments,  practical  problems
emerge out of the con(cid:223)icts of interests between states. To put it differently,
there is no authority to determine (cid:210)the strongest link.(cid:211)That is why (cid:210)iden-
tity(cid:211) cannot serve as the only benchmark, even in a functionalist perspec-
tive. (cid:210)Communication(cid:211) is important, too, and it means here that the cul-
tural heritage must neither be withheld from interested people in other
countries nor hidden behind closed doors from the international research
community. It seems widely accepted that the exchange of cultural prop-
erty(cid:209)exhibitions in foreign countries, for example(cid:209)serves not only as a
marvelous opportunity for states to represent their cultural treasures but
also as an aid in increasing public interest equivalent to what Engstler called
(cid:210)educational factors.(cid:211)

The historical origins of the idea of a (cid:210)common cultural heritage of hu-
mankind(cid:211) can be found in a study of the V(cid:154)lkerbund that dates back to the
late 1930s.24 During the 1945 Dumbarton Oaks Conference, Brasil suggested
an amendment to Chapter IX of the United Nations Charter that would
have understood (cid:210)culture(cid:211) as the common heritage of humankind. Fur-
thermore, the amendment provided for appropriate institutional structures
in the United Nations. This proposal paved the way for the 1954 Hague
Convention, which not only took up the concept of the cultural heritage of
humankind in international law for the very (cid:222)rst time but also provided for
both  general  protection  of cultural  property  and  special  protection  of
some listed objects, the so-called (cid:210)World Heritage.(cid:211)25

Whereas the Hague Convention aims at protecting cultural property
in time of war, the 1970 UNESCO Convention has a different goal. Sharon
Williams has noted that the convention (cid:210)is the (cid:222)rst multinational conven-
tion whose aim is to protect cultural property from destructive threats in
time of peace. It refers, however, not to international culture but to na-
tional culture . . . .(cid:211)26

There seems to be little point in dealing with the 1970 UNESCO
Convention because it was not rati(cid:222)ed by a number of Western states.
Nevertheless,  it  stands  for  one  conception  of the  common  heritage 
principle(cid:209)harmonization and cooperation without overturning the pri-
macy of the nation.27 Moreover, the convention is in force for eighty-six
states, at least (cid:222)ve of which have important art trade and Western-style
legal systems (Australia, Canada, France, Italy, United States). Switzer-
land has announced that it will become a party, and Britain is reconsid-
ering the convention under the new government. Thus, with the increas-
ing support for this convention, it might well be that a new international
regime is emerging.28

However, a more interesting approach has developed. Its aim is coop-
eration, too, but it assumes a general and global interest in the protection
of cultural property that does not end at state borders. Somewhat similar
to the protection of human rights, this approach claims that the protection
of cultural property may not be left with state governments alone. From
this follows that states and state governments accept a certain loss of com-
petence and power due to a higher global interest.29 Several proposals have
been put forward to make this abstract idea a little more concrete. Sabine
von Schorlemer, for instance, has reported on trusteeship, that states are
only (cid:210)trustees(cid:211) of their cultural property and must provide for its effective
protection.30 Other proposals aim at a graded order of property rights.31

With the 1972 UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of
the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the most important legislation
in this (cid:222)eld came into effect. It combined the second conception of the
common heritage thought(cid:209)protecting cultural property in the interest of
all peoples(cid:209)with the reality of a world of nation-states. State sovereignty
is fully recognized, including national property rights. However, all mem-
ber states recognize that their national heritage is part of the world heritage
and promise to cooperate with research and protection, as well as techni-
cal and (cid:222)nancial assistance.

A few aspects of the 1972 UNESCO Convention are interesting. The
legislative language includes a reference to the interest of all humankind;
thus, the common heritage of humankind principle has (cid:222)nally reached the
international law of cultural property protection (in time of peace). It
seems to have had few consequences, however; it is descriptive rather than
normative in nature. What is (cid:210)the interest of humankind?(cid:211) (cid:210)Humankind(cid:211)
is not a manageable legal term: Who is allowed to speak for it? Moreover,
Article IV (Sec. 2) of the convention only directs the member state to en-
sure the protection of the cultural property within its sphere of sover-
eignty. Other member states or the community, respectively, will assist only
when asked to do so. The quality and quantity of assistance depends on
whether the object in question is listed by the World Heritage Commit-
tee.32 Unfortunately, there is no enforcement mechanism that would require
states to take better care of their cultural heritage. One could argue that
this approach turns the intended aim of protecting the (cid:210)World Heritage(cid:211)
into a rhetorical, even obsolete, euphemism.

However, some debate has taken place during the past four years con-
cerning the  (cid:210)monitoring(cid:211) of World Heritage sites. UNESCO is trying
strenuously to convince governments of the necessity of strengthening its
position, and the case of the former Yugoslavia proves its point.33 The rel-
atively high level of acceptance of the 1972 Convention had to be paid for
by powerlessness.34 Thus, the UNESCO Convention is not an interna-

of cooperation.35 There is no (cid:210)internationalization(cid:211) of national cultural
heritage, which raises further questions as to the legal quality of the com-
mon heritage approach in general: can this principle be applied to legal is-
sues that have already been assigned to the sphere of national law? In other
words, can the common heritage principle be transferred from state-free
areas (such as the moon, space or the Antarctic), which are supposed to
keep their (cid:210)international status quo,(cid:211) to issues such as cultural property
protection, which have already been regulated by national law?36

In a general evaluation of the common heritage of humankind princi-
ple, M. V. White has concluded that this approach would have to bring
about restrictions on state sovereignty if it were to ful(cid:222)ll its aims of pro-
viding access to resources and progress (technological or economic) for the
Third World Countries.37 However, this requirement has not been met in
the case of cultural property protection, where Third World Countries aim
at  restitution  of their  former  cultural  property  in  particular.38 Rudolf
Dolzer concludes:

The Common Heritage principle may be applied to the area of
cultural property protection only within narrow boundaries, because
the principle competes here with other structures and subjects that
are legally recognized. Its relation to the latter has not been clari(cid:222)ed
so far.39

Our conclusion is twofold. First, international regimes are largely pow-
erless (cid:210)paper tigers(cid:211) that lack enforcement mechanisms. That holds true, in
particular, for conventions seeking to protect cultural property in times of
peace. International law protecting cultural property in time of war may be
more concrete, having more consequences in case of violation. In the end,
though, history shows that, if the reservoirs of minimum mutual respect
break down, there will be no control. Thus, in general, the common her-
itage approach refers more to (cid:210)facts of a case(cid:211) than to (cid:210)consequences(cid:211) with
legal force.40  This is a general problem of international law and not a par-
ticular weakness of international cultural property protection measures.

Second, and maybe even more important, the lack of consequences
seems to be more than a question of the power of nation-states. In my
opinion, it has much to do with the genuine quality of the legal area of cul-
tural property protection. Cultural property is usually not a res communis.
Thus, the idea of a common heritage must be put into relation to the (na-
tional) legal status quo. What does it mean for cultural property to be both
national cultural heritage and the common heritage of all humankind? This
dilemma lies at the base of the problem. From a functionalist perspective,
it seems rather strange to equate that which is recognized by states as cul-

tural heritage with the common heritage of all humankind(cid:209)at least in the
(cid:222)rst instance. It is not foreign to the nature of culture and of cultural prop-
erty that they have stronger links to one region, nation, or social group than
to another, not to speak of the international community. However, in a
globalizing international society, where cultures reach beyond their gen-
uine, traditional area into the rest of the world, it is imaginable that re-
gional and national links lose relative signi(cid:222)cance in favor of the interna-
tional community. Nevertheless, this approach has not yet succeeded in
becoming a powerful alternative to the nation-state-oriented regulation of
cultural property protection.

Protection of cultural property not only furthers the protection of mater-
ial goods, but also of humans.41 Where human rights are not respected, cul-
tural property is usually not protected. The reverse holds true as well(cid:209)de-
struction of the cultural heritage often means an attack on culture and
cultural identity as well. This can be seen in many armed con(cid:223)icts, not the
least in the former Yugoslavia (for example, in Dubrovnic or Mostar). Cul-
tural property, culture, and social identity have multiple interlinks; they are
bound together in one inseparable unity. However, these links are not fully
understood, and, moreover, they are not exclusive to one social group. Cul-
tural property can be national heritage, common heritage of some nations,
or part of the common heritage of all humankind. It is dif(cid:222)cult to assign
cultural property to a single entity, thus identifying the legitimate guardian.
Object-centrism might point to a solution. Why care about the legiti-
mate guardian at all? Find the most effective curator who may responsibly
and with appropriate knowledge take care of cultural property. Make re-
search and maintenance of the substance the (cid:222)rst priority. Give access to
the cultural heritage to as many people as possible, but always respect the
integrity of the cultural property in question without exception.

Certainly, these principles sound sensible. However, they negate the
genuine reason for the concern about cultural property. Cultural property
provides access to the history of nations. It is the foundation for cultural
and social identity, for learning something about other peoples. Finally, it
enriches lives, providing joy and sometimes even edi(cid:222)cation as part of daily
life. No one would advocate a frivolous dealing with cultural property just
for the fun of present generations. However, it must be asked whether the
protection of cultural property is a goal in its own right. A certain risk
must be accepted. This is always a risky enterprise, but is it not worth it? To
de(cid:222)ne culture independently from humans is impossible; thus, it seems il-
logical to deal with cultural property as if it were sacrosanct.

What can be done to improve protection of cultural heritage? From an
abundance of suggestions, there are three approaches. First, national gov-

cultural heritage protection

ernments should restrict their policies to a small selection of assorted ob-
jects. From a functionalist(cid:213)s perspective, generalizing national cultural prop-
erty protection seems neither legitimate nor effective. National resources
should be focused on only the most important pieces. Of course, some
governments take this view of generalizing their efforts to keep all (na-
tional) cultural property within their borders, because they have already
lost so much that any loss is now seen as serious. If the objects they pro-
tect in such a strict manner are the last remnants, one could certainly argue
that the small quantity itself makes them important to the respective cul-
tural identity. Thus, the functionalist view does not necessarily have a prob-
lem with such government policies. In any case, criminalizing the art mar-
ket by nationalizing all cultural property without speci(cid:222)cation only leads to
(cid:210)black markets(cid:211) that make it dif(cid:222)cult to maintain control of the objects
that circulate in private hands. If a state considers a given work of art, for
instance, as absolutely crucial, the state should buy the work. Additional
legal protection by (cid:210)public dedication(cid:211) ((cid:154)ffenliche Widmung) may offer in-
creased civil law protection.42 If a government considers an object impor-
tant, but not crucial, the state may think about a proviso that reserves for
the government the right to veto any sale of the cultural property.

Second, cooperation among museums should be increased and strength-
ened. The role of international organizations, such as UNESCO, for ex-
ample, could be extended. Organizations such as UNESCO are designed
for increasing awareness and promotion concerning these issues, and they
can (cid:210)stigmatize(cid:211) violations against international conventions, such as the
1972 UNESCO Convention, even though the (cid:210)hard(cid:211) legal enforcement is
lacking.  If one  believes  some  students  of international  regimes,  this
(cid:210)soft(cid:211) effect of legal regimes may well turn into powerful weapons against
violations.

Third, notwithstanding the positive (cid:210)soft(cid:211) effects of international re-
gimes, an enforcement mechanism still needs to be implemented on the in-
ternational level that includes both control and legal enforcement. Early
monitoring can help to avoid dif(cid:222)cult and hard-to-solve situations. This
suggestion might be the least realistic one(cid:209)even more so for international
law in time of war. However, small steps must be taken toward a better,
even though utopian, international order, if some basic problems that our
present international legal order poses are to be overcome.

Returning to the initial question of who is the legitimate guardian of
cultural property, one must conclude that both the nation-state and the in-
ternational community hold guardianship. However, they do so in different
ways and to different extents. For this author, it seems impossible to pro-
tect cultural property without reference to the people, be it on the national
or on the international level. Rather, it is the very function of cultural

property in society that quali(cid:222)es it as a special legal issue that legitimizes
enhanced protection. If so, principles of cultural property protection must
refer to the functions of identity-generation and communication and start
from there when searching for guidelines.
