Bayh-Dole: statute, regulation and implications
for government contractors
Bart A. Gerstenblith and Scott J. Popma*

For those fortunate enough to have come of age after
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, it is hard to
imagine the difﬁculties of developing and commercial-
izing inventions arising from federally funded research,
or the inefﬁciencies created by the multiple systems in
use before the Act. By some counts, there were 26 dif-
ferent agency policies on IP: most favoured government
ownership and only a small number allowed contrac-
tors to own the inventions. With no clear road to
owning IP, there was little incentive to invest the time
and resources necessary to commercialize an invention
arising from federally funded research.

The Act, which was passed to facilitate the transfer
of inventions arising from federally funded research to
the private sector, contains seven speciﬁc policy state-
ments and objectives. It seeks to promote ‘the utiliza-
tion of
inventions arising from federally supported
research or development’ and ‘the commercialization
and public availability of
inventions made in the
United States by United States industry and labor’.1 It
also seeks to ensure ‘that the Government obtains sufﬁ-
cient rights in federally supported inventions to meet
the needs of the Government and protect the public
against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions’.2

To accomplish these objectives, the Act ﬁrst provides
a uniﬁed policy for all federally funded research and
permits government contractors, such as universities
or small businesses, to retain title to their inventions.
Secondly, the Act gives agencies the authority to grant
exclusive patent licences, with a preference for small
businesses. Thirdly,
to balance the newly created
private interests, the government retains both (i) a
non-exclusive
a patented invention
throughout the world, and (ii) ‘march-in’ rights, allow-
ing a federal agency to grant a licence to a new appli-
cant in certain limited circumstances.

This article
† This article explores the provisions of the Bayh-
Dole Act (‘the Act’), which was passed in 1980
to facilitate the transfer of
inventions arising
from federally funded research to the private
sector.

† The Act permits government contractors, such as
universities or small businesses, to retain title to
their inventions and grants the government (1) a
non-exclusive right to use a patented invention
throughout the world, and (2) ‘march-in’ rights,
allowing a federal agency to grant a licence to a
new applicant in certain limited circumstances.
The Act also gives agencies the authority to
grant exclusive patent licences.

† The statutory scheme of the Act is fraught with
potential pitfalls for the unwary. Contractors
must be aware of the scope of the Act and under-
stand when the government may have rights to
an invention. Contractors also must be aware of
their duties under the Act, including the strict
time requirements and deadlines. Finally, when
performing due-diligence related to potential li-
censing or portfolio purchasing agreements, or
other transactions involving IP rights, businesses
must comply with the Act or risk forfeiture of
patent rights in a subject invention.

The ﬁrst section of this article explains how the Act
affects the relative obligations and rights of the federal
agencies, contractors, and inventors. It then discusses

case law interpreting statutory and regulatory language
and the impact of non-compliance with the Act’s

requirements. The second section focuses on how the
Act affects businesses
that might ﬁnd themselves
subject to its requirements and the practical import-
ance of understanding the intricacies of the Act.

The Bayh-Dole provisions
The Act is codiﬁed in sections 200– 212 of Chapter 18,
Title 35, of the US Code and implemented by 37 CFR
sections 401.1– 401.16 and 404.1– 404.14. It contains a
statement of the congressional policy and objectives
behind its enactment, followed by provisions establish-
ing the rights and obligations of the federal agencies
and contractors that enter agreements on federally
funded research and development.3

Deﬁnitions and scope
Deﬁnitions of important terms used throughout the
Act and the federal regulations are provided in 35
USC section 201 and 37 CFR sections 401.2 and
404.3. Section 201(a) deﬁnes ‘Federal agency’ as ‘any
executive agency as deﬁned in section 105 of title 5,
and the military departments as deﬁned by section
102 of title 5’.4 Importantly,
is
broadly deﬁned by sections 201(b) and 401.2(a) as
‘any contract, grant, or cooperative agreement entered
into between any Federal agency, other
than the
Tennessee Valley Authority, and any contractor for the
performance of experimental, developmental, or re-
search work funded in whole or in part by the Federal
Government’.5 Thus even partial funding by the gov-
ernment brings the work under the strictures of the
Act and regulations.

‘funding agreement’

under a funding agreement, and at least one court has
held that inventions developed with funds indirectly
provided under funding agreements are governed by
the Act. In Trinity Industries, Inc. v Road Systems, Inc.,6
the Federal Highway Administration provided money
to the Texas State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation, which in turn used the money to fund
research projects at the Texas Transportation Institute.7
Since the fund transfers were undertaken in accordance
with ‘funding agreements’, the court held that the Act
applied to inventions which were developed with those
funds.8

The Act further deﬁnes ‘contractor’ as ‘any person,
small business ﬁrm,9 or nonproﬁt organization10 that is
a party to a funding agreement’.11 Given the funda-
mental focus of the Act on patent rights, the term
‘subject
is
broadly deﬁned as ‘any invention12 of the contractor
conceived or ﬁrst actually reduced to practice in the
performance of work under a funding agreement’.13

is of primary importance:

it

An understanding of the term ‘practical application’
is important in light of the Act’s focus on the develop-
ment and commercialization of
inventions ﬁnanced
with government funds. ‘Practical application’ as used
in the Act

means to manufacture in the case of a composition or
product, to practice in the case of a process or method, or
to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each
case, under such conditions as to establish that the inven-
tion is being utilized and that its beneﬁts are to the extent
permitted by law or Government regulations available to
the public on reasonable terms.14

It

is not always a simple matter to determine
whether funding provided for a project has been given

Consistent with the deﬁnition of ‘subject invention’, the
term ‘made’, when used in relation to any invention,

37 CFR §§401.1-16 implement 35 USC §§202-204 while 37 CFR
§§404.1-14 implement 35 USC §§207-209. See 45 CFR §§650.1-19
(governing allocation of rights to inventions made in performance of
National Science Foundation-assisted research). Section 401.1 provides
that the regulations govern ‘all Federal agencies’ and broadly deﬁnes its
applicability to ‘all funding agreements with small business ﬁrms and
nonproﬁt organizations executed after the effective date of this part,
except for a funding agreement made primarily for educational
purposes’. See 35 USC §212 (2006), carving out funding agreements
made primarily for educational purposes.
See also 37 CFR §404.3(b) (2011), similarly deﬁning ‘Federal agency’.
‘Executive agency’ is deﬁned as an Executive department, a Government
corporation, and an independent establishment: 5 USC §105 (2006).
‘Military departments’ include ‘The Department of the Army’, ‘The
Department of the Navy’, and ‘The Department of the Air Force’: 5 USC
§102 (2006).
It also includes any ‘assignment, substitution of parties, or subcontract
of any type entered into for the performance of experimental,
developmental, or research work under a funding agreement’: 35 USC
§201(b) (2006); 37 CFR §401.2(a) (2011).

35 USC §201(h) (2006); see 37 CFR §§401.02(g), 404.3(c) (2011).
‘Nonproﬁt organization’ is deﬁned as ‘universities or other institutions

exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue

‘means the conception or ﬁrst actual reduction to prac-
tice of such invention’.15

Although ‘subject invention’ is broadly deﬁned, the
regulations do not necessarily cover later advancements
in related research. As 37 CFR section 401.1(a)(1)
explains,

[t]o the extent that a non-government sponsor established
a project which, although closely related, falls outside the
planned and committed activities of a government-funded
project . . . inventions made in performance of the non-
government sponsored project would not be subject to the
conditions of these regulations.16

In Collins v Western Digital Technologies, Inc., the court,
relying on 37 CFR section 401.1, examined the claims of
the patent and the alleged inventions and concluded that
‘using knowledge gained from governmental research to
create a related advance does not transform that subse-
quent advance into a subject invention’.17 Because the
plaintiffs provided ‘abundant evidence’ that the patented
invention was developed as part of a ‘separate, privately
funded research project’ from the project funded by the
Navy and that the technology developed under each
project had substantially different characteristics,
the
claimed technology was not a ‘subject invention’.18

Disposition of rights
Section 202 of the Act permits ‘each nonproﬁt organ-
ization or small business ﬁrm’ to ‘elect to retain title to

not required to permit a contractor to elect to retain

804 F. Supp. 614 (DNJ 1992), denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss
for lack of standing based on alleged violations of the Act because the
defendants failed to establish that the Act applied to the patent-in-suit
because (1) the inventive work was performed under a funding
agreement that did not contain the provisions required by §202; and (2)
the claimed invention was not a ‘subject invention’ even though the
work was related to that which was performed under a funding
agreement.

resulted from a continuation-in-part application that claimed priority to

include the standard patent rights clauses set forth in 37 CFR
§401.14(a), except in limited circumstances: 37 CFR §401.3(a) (2011).
37 CFR §404.5 sets forth certain restrictions and conditions on all
licences granted under the section and speciﬁes particular terms that
apply to each licence: 37 CFR §404.5(b)(1) –(11) (2011).

international ﬁrms, ‘when the contractor is not located
in the United States or does not have a place of busi-
ness located in the United States or is subject to the
control of a foreign government’, a funding agreement
need not provide for the retention of rights.21 Secondly,
‘in exceptional circumstances’, when the agency deter-
mines that ‘restriction or elimination of the right to
retain title to any subject invention will better promote
the policy and objectives of ’ the Act, retention of rights
may not be provided for.22 Thirdly, a funding agree-
ment may not provide for the retention of rights by a
contractor when ‘the restriction or elimination of the
right . . . is necessary to protect the security’ of ‘foreign
intelligence or counter-intelligence activities’ as ‘deter-
mined by a Government authority which is authorized
by statute or Executive order’ to conduct such activ-
ities.23 Finally, election of rights is not guaranteed
when the funding agreement pertains to certain activ-
ities related to the Department of Energy.24

If a federal agency wishes to limit a contractor’s re-
tention of rights, it must follow speciﬁc steps under
section 202(a).25 Before using any of the limitations,
the agency must prepare a written determination, in-
cluding ‘a statement of facts supporting the determin-
ation’, that the conditions identiﬁed in the exception
exist.26 If the agency determines that restricting or
eliminating a right to retain title will better promote
the policy and objectives of the Act under section

justifying the determination’.27 The analysis
should
address ‘with speciﬁcity’ how limiting the right of re-
tention better achieves the objectives of the Act.28 The

35 USC §202(a)(i) (2006).
35 USC §202(a)(ii) (2006).
35 USC §202(a)(iii) (2006). The regulations dictate that an agency

out the option for retention of rights only ‘as are necessary to address
the exceptional circumstances or concerns which led to the use of the
exception’: 37 CFR §401.3(b) (2011). Further, an agency may apply

agreement, rather than to the entire agreement: 37 CFR §401.3(d)
(2011).

agency must ‘promptly provide’ a copy of ‘each deter-
mination, statement of facts, and, if applicable, ana-
lysis’, to the contractor along with a notiﬁcation of the
contractor or prospective contractor’s right to appeal
the determination under 35 USC section 202(b)(4) and
37 CFR section 401.4.29 Contractors who believe that a
determination conﬂicts with the policies and objectives
of the Act or constitutes an abuse of discretion by the
agency can appeal

section 203(b) and 37 CFR section 401.4.30

Any contractor electing to retain rights must follow
the provisions in the Funding Agreement as mandated
by section 202(c). First, the contractor must disclose
each subject invention to the federal agency within a
reasonable time after it becomes known to contractor
personnel responsible for the administration of patent
matters. If the contractor does not adequately disclose,
the federal government may receive title to any subject
invention.31 Secondly,
the contractor must make a
written election within 2 years after disclosure to the
federal agency (or longer if approved by the agency) in-
dicating whether the contractor will retain title to a
subject invention.32 If the contractor does not elect to
retain rights or fails to elect such rights within the

designated time period, the federal government may
receive title to any subject invention.33 Thirdly, a con-
tractor electing rights must agree to ﬁle a patent appli-
cation before any statutory bar date under 35 USC
section 102(b), and ﬁle corresponding patent applica-
tions in other countries in which the contractor wants
to retain title within a reasonable time.34 Although the
implementing regulations provide
standard patent
rights clauses that proscribe additional time periods for
compliance, they also permit requests for extensions
that an agency may grant at its discretion.35 Fourthly,
an agency may require that the contractor report on
‘the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization’ that
the contractor or his licensee or assignee undertakes.36
Information provided by contractors, however, ‘shall be
treated by the Federal agency as commercial and ﬁnan-
cial information obtained from a person and privileged
and conﬁdential and not subject to disclosure under
section 552 of title 5’ (the Freedom of Information
Act).37 Fifthly, the contractor must include within the
speciﬁcation of a patent application a statement speci-
fying that the invention was made with government
support and that the government has certain rights in
the invention.38

37 CFR §401.3(e) (2011). The Secretary of Commerce, believing that
any determinations are contrary to the policies and objectives of the Act,
may advise the head of the agency involved and the Administrator of
the Ofﬁce of Federal Procurement Policy, recommending corrective
actions: 35 USC §202(b)(1) (2006); 37 CFR §401.3(f) (2011). The
Administrator can then take further action if one or more Federal
agencies are utilizing the authority of §202(a)(i) or (ii) in ‘a manner
that is contrary to the policies and objectives’ of the Act; 35 USC
§202(b)(2) (2006).
37 CFR §401.4 sets forth a comprehensive scheme for administrative
review of an agency’s determination applying one of the exceptions
under §202(a)(i)– (iv) to limit a contractor’s right to elect retention of
title: 37 CFR §401.4 (2011), culminating in an appeal to the US Court
of Federal Claims; 35 USC §203(b) (2006).
35 USC §202(c)(1) (2006). The regulations contain speciﬁc standard
patent rights clauses for inclusion in funding agreements. These
regulations serve many purposes, and are intended to implement,
through the terms contained in funding agreements, the provisions of
the Act. In particular, they require that the contractor disclose each
subject invention within 2 months ‘after the inventor discloses it in
writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters’: 37 CFR
§401.14(a) (2011): ‘Patent Rights’ clause (c)(1), ‘Invention Disclosure,
Election of Title and ﬁling of Patent Application by Contractor’. The
regulations add that the disclosure ‘shall be in the form of a written
report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was
made and the inventor(s)’. The disclosure must ‘identify any
publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a
manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication,
and if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of
disclosure’ and the contractor must notify the agency even after
disclosure, if a manuscript is accepted for publication or the subject
invention is planned for sale or public use. The standard patent clauses
include actions required by the contractor to protect the government’s
interest: 37 CFR §401.14(a) (2011), ‘Patent Rights’ clause (f),
‘Contractor Action to Protect the Government’s Interest’.
35 USC §202(c)(2) (2006). If, however, publication, on sale, or public
use initiated the 1 year statutory period under 35 USC §102(b), the

agency can shorten the period for election of rights to a date not more
than 60 days before the end of the statutory period: 37 CFR §401.14(a)
(2011), ‘Patent Rights’ clause (c)(2). Section 3(g)(7) of the America
Invents Act ( ‘AIA’) harmonizes 35 USC §202(c)(2) – (3) with the AIA’s
amendments to 35 USC §102(b) by generally changing reference to the
‘one year statutory period’ to ‘the 1-year period referred to in section
102(b)’: AIA, Pub L No 112– 29, §3(g)(7)(A)(i)– (ii), §3(g)(7)(B), 125
Stat 288, 293 (2011). These amendments to §202(c)(2) –(3) take effect
on 16 March 2013: ibid, §3(n). Judicial interpretations of revised
§102(b) will thus directly impact the period by which a contractor must
provide timely notice to a Federal agency to satisfy the contractor’s
obligations under a funding agreement and the Bayh-Dole Act.

Information obtained on utilization as a result of a march-in
proceeding, discussed above and described in §203, is similarly
protected: 35 USC §202(c)(5) (2006).
35 USC §202(c)(6) (2006). The standard patent rights clause requires
that, the following speciﬁc statement be included in any US patent
application and any patent issuing thereon: ‘This invention was made
with government support under (identify the contract) awarded by
(identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the
invention’: 37 CFR §401.14(a) (2011). ‘Patent Rights’ clause (f)(4).
Failure to include this mandatory statement in a patent speciﬁcation
was rejected as a basis for inequitable conduct in Trinity Industries, Inc.
v Road Systems, Inc., 235 F. Supp. 2d 536 (ED Tex 2002), where a court
found that the patentee’s failure to disclose the source of the funding
was not material to patentability because the funding source did not
have a ‘logical relationship to the decision on whether or not to issue
the . . . patent’.

The consequences of non-compliance with section
202(c) can be dire. In Campbell Plastics Engineering &
Manufacturing, Inc. v Brownlee, the US Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit afﬁrmed the Armed Services
Board of Contract Appeals’ decision upholding the
demand of an Administrative Contracting Ofﬁcer
(‘ACO’) for title to an invention that a contractor failed
to report in accordance with section 202(c)(1).39 On
more than one occasion, Campbell Plastics reported that
no invention was developed under its government con-
tract but then ﬁled a patent application directed to the
subject invention.40 Even though the patent speciﬁcation
reserved to the government a paid-up right to a licence
and the Army had knowledge of the application, the
ACO determined that Campbell Plastics forfeited title to
the invention by failing to comply with its contract
implementing the requirements of section 202(c).41 The
Federal Circuit rejected Campbell Plastics’s argument
that its reports, including an enabling disclosure to the
Army, satisﬁed its duties under section 202 to report
subject inventions because the ‘piecemeal submissions
[did] not adequately disclose the invention’.42 Accord-
ingly, the government had the right to take title to the
invention and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.43
Private parties may not force an agency to seek for-
feiture, and forfeiture is not automatic even if the Act
is violated. In Central Admixture Pharmacy Services,
Inc. v Advanced Cardiac Solutions, P.C., the Federal
Circuit rejected the defendant’s argument that plaintiffs
lacked standing to assert an action for patent infringe-
ment.44 The research that led to the patent was funded
by a grant
from the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) to the inventor’s employer, the University of
California (UC). During prosecution,
the inventor
assigned his rights to UC, but UC later indicated to
NIH that it intended to abandon prosecution. The in-
ventor then requested that NIH waive its rights in the
patent application so that he could pursue the applica-
tion in his personal capacity. NIH agreed to provide a
waiver subject to the inventor’s executing a licence to
the government. The inventor, however, never executed
the licence, even though the patent speciﬁcation com-
plied with section 202(c)(6). Thereafter, UC assigned

its rights to the inventor, and the inventor exclusively
licensed the patent to Advanced Cardiac Solutions.

The Federal Circuit acknowledged that, since the
inventor’s licence to the government was never exe-
cuted, there was an open question whether that failure
enabled NIH to exercise its discretion to void the inven-
tor’s title in the patent.

The key difference between Central Admixture and
Campbell Plastics, however, is that, unlike the ACO in
Campbell Plastics, NIH showed no interest in voiding
the inventor’s title. The Central Admixture court held
that the agency had discretion whether to void title, and
that title was not automatically void even in light of an
admitted defect in the chain of title. Importantly, the
court held that a private party in the defendant’s pos-
ition has no basis to challenge the government’s decision
to invoke forfeiture. The Federal Circuit therefore deter-
mined that, in light of the NIH’s apparent complacency,
plaintiffs had standing to assert the patent.

The key difference between Central Admixture
and Campbell Plastics, however, is that, unlike
the ACO in Campbell Plastics, NIH showed no

interest in voiding the inventor’s title

Funding agreements must contain certain non-negoti-
able terms. When a contractor elects to retain rights, the
agreement must provide a ‘nonexclusive, nontransfer-
able, irrevocable, paid-up licence to practice or have
practiced for or on behalf of the United States any
the world’.45 Funding
subject
agreements also must contain elements of sections 203

Important to inventors, if a contractor does not elect
to retain title to a subject invention, the federal agency
may consider and grant requests for ‘retention of rights
by the inventor’ subject to the provisions of the Act and
implementing regulations.52 An inventor’s ability to
retain rights to a subject invention, however, is only trig-
gered after a contractor elects not to retain title ﬁrst.
Thus, in Fenn v Yale University, the US Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit rejected John Fenn’s argument
that he properly retained rights to an invention he devel-
oped with NIH funding while employed at Yale Univer-
sity.53 To support his argument, Fenn pointed to a letter
he had sent to the NIH. The letter contained a clause in-
dicating that the obligations of Yale and Fenn to the
federal government were satisﬁed. An ofﬁcial at NIH had
signed the letter. This letter, Fenn urged, provided a rea-
sonable inference that NIH determined that Fenn was the
patent’s rightful owner. The Second Circuit disagreed:

Cancer Research, a court concluded that the language of the statute, the
legislative history, and the regulations implementing §202 do not suggest
that Congress intended that contractors follow a federally imposed sharing
ratio or minimum share: 787 F. Supp. 360, 368 (SDNY 1992). That court
dismissed the inventors’ claims to recover an equal share of the royalties
stemming from a discovery they made while employed by Sloan-Kettering.
35 USC §202(c)(7)(C) (2006). This requirement does not apply to
funding agreements for the operation of a ‘Government-owned-
contractor-operated facility’ and the balance of any royalties earned is
determined ‘after payment of expenses (including payments to
inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions’.
35 USC §202(c)(7)(D) (2006). The regulations acknowledge that ‘[w]hat
constitutes reasonable efforts . . . will vary with the circumstances and
the nature, duration, and expense of efforts needed to bring the
invention to market’: 37 CFR §401.7(a) (2011). Section 20(i)(2)(B) of
the AIA amends the language of 35 USC §202(c)(7)(D) by requiring
that a preference be given to small business ﬁrms in the licensing of
subject inventions ‘except where it is determined to be infeasible
following a reasonable inquiry’: see AIA, §20(i)(2)(B), 125 Stat. 334, 335
(2011). This change takes effect on 16 September 2012.
35 USC §202(c)(7)(E)(i) –(ii) (2006). Section 13(b) of the AIA amends
35 USC §202(c)(7)(E)(i), inter alia, by increasing the percentage of
subject-invention royalties a nonproﬁt operator of a government-
owned-contractor-operated facility can retain from 25 to 85% after costs
and other expenses are taken into account. This provision took effect on
16 September 2011, and applies to any patent issued before, on, or after
that date.
35 USC §202(d) (2006); see 37 CFR §401.9 (2011). Further, where a
Federal employee is a co-inventor of a subject invention, the agency may
licence or assign whatever rights it would acquire in the subject
invention to the nonproﬁt organization, small business ﬁrm, or non-
Federal inventor, or acquire the non-Federal entity’s rights if it would
expedite the development of the invention: 35 USC §202(e)(1) –(2)
(2006); see 37 CFR §401.10 (2011). Any acquisition of rights from the
non-Federal entity must be agreed to voluntarily by the non-Federal

a federal agency such as the NIH may only grant an
inventor’s request to retain rights to an invention subject
to the [Bayh-Dole] Act when the contractor (in this case
Yale) has elected not to retain rights to the invention.

Yale, the Second Circuit pointed out, had informed
NIH of
its intention to retain its rights. Thus the
Second Circuit found Fenn’s interpretation of the sig-
niﬁcance of the NIH ofﬁcial’s signature implausible,
and afﬁrmed the district court’s order requiring that
Fenn assign the patent to Yale.54

In Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior
University v Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., the Supreme
Court held that the Act does not automatically vest
title to federally funded inventions in federal contrac-
tors.55 The court rejected Stanford’s argument that the
deﬁnition of ‘subject invention’ compelled the conclu-
sion that contractors held title to all inventions created
under their government contracts. To the contrary, the
term is deﬁned as ‘any invention of the contractor . . . ’:
Stanford’s interpretation (1) assumes that Congress set
aside ‘two centuries of patent law [i.e. that title vests in
the inventor of a patent] in a statutory deﬁnition’ and
(2) renders the phrase ‘of the contractor’ superﬂuous.56
Rather, construing the phrase to refer to ‘a particular

entity: 35 USC §202(e)(2) (2006). In Southern Research Institute v
Grifﬁn Corp., 928 F.2d 1249, 1253 – 55 (11th Cir. 1991), the court held
that a decision by an agency under a prior version of §202(e) was
committed to agency discretion by law and thus not reviewable under
§802(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act. Before 1 November 2000,
§202(e) ‘authorized’ the government to transfer or assign the rights it
might acquire from its employees, but as amended by Pub L 106– 404,
§6(1), 1 November 2000, 114 Stat 1745, §202(e) provided that the
government ‘may’ do so, thus reﬂecting the agency’s discretion. Notably,
37 CFR §§501.1 – 11 establish a ‘Uniform Patent Policy for Rights in
Inventions Made by Government Employees’ and apply to ‘any
invention made by a Government employee and to any action taken
with respect thereto’: see 37 CFR §501.2 (2011).
184 Fed. Appx. 21 (2nd Cir. 2006). The Second Circuit noted that the
district court found that Fenn breached Yale’s long-standing patent
policy with faculty members by failing to disclose the signiﬁcance of his
invention to Yale and patenting the invention in his own name. Thus
defrauding Yale constituted civil theft and the district court ordered
Fenn to assign the patent to Yale.

54 Citing 35 USC §202(d). The district court also found that, since Fenn

never formally requested that the NIH make a determination under
§202(d) allowing him to retain rights to the patent, neither of the ‘two
prerequisites’ under the Act—contractor non-election and an inventor
request for retention—were satisﬁed.
131 S. Ct. 2188 (2011); cf Alzheimer’s Inst. of Am., Inc. v Avid
Radiopharmaceuticals, No 10-6908, 2011 US Dist LEXIS 98302, at *29
(ED Pa, 31 August 2011), which held that under Florida law, unlike the
Bayh-Dole Act, ‘inventions developed or discovered by an employee in
the course of employment’ with the University of South Florida are the
property of the University.
ibid. The court noted that if ‘of the contractor’ were deleted from the
deﬁnition of ‘subject invention’, the deﬁnition would cover ‘any
invention . . . conceived or ﬁrst actually reduced to practice in the
performance of work under a funding agreement’.

category of inventions . . . that is, those owned by or
belonging to the contractor—makes the phrase mean-
ingful
in the statutory deﬁnition’. Thus the court
concluded:

[T]he Bayh-Dole Act . . . does not displace an inventor’s
antecedent title in his invention. Only when an invention
belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come
into play. The Act’s disposition of rights—like much of the
rest of the Bayh-Dole Act—serves to clarify the order of
priority of rights between the Federal Government and a
federal contractor in a federally funded invention that
already belongs to the contractor. Nothing more.57

Although the Act generally is restricted to subject inven-
tions, it also provides a limited exception whereby an
agency can require third-party licensing of non-subject
inventions owned by the contractor. A funding agree-
ment may require such licensing if it ‘has been approved
by the agency and a written justiﬁcation has been signed
by the head of the agency’.58 In such circumstances, the
provision must ‘clearly state whether the licensing may
be required in connection with the practice of a subject
invention, a speciﬁcally identiﬁed work object, or both’:
the agency head may not delegate this authority. And,
even when such a provision is included in a funding
agreement, an agency may not require such licensing
unless the head of the agency ‘determines that the use of
the invention by others is necessary for the practice of a
subject invention or for the use of a work object of the
funding agreement and that such action is necessary to
achieve the practical application of the subject invention
or work object’.59 In addition, any agency determination
must be ‘on the record after an opportunity for an
agency hearing’, and the contractor has the right to seek
judicial review of any such determination within 60
days of notiﬁcation.60

March-in rights
Funding agreements must also contain the provisions
of section 203 allowing for march-in rights by the
federal agency—the right ‘to require the contractor, an
assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to

grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive
licence in any ﬁeld of use to a responsible applicant or
applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the
circumstances’. If the contractor refuses, the agency
must have the right to ‘grant such a licence itself ’.61 An
agency, however, is not permitted to exercise this right
on a whim. Before marching in, an agency must deter-
mine that

1. the action is necessary because the contractor or as-
signee has not taken, or is not expected to take
within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve
practical application of the subject invention in such
ﬁeld of use;

2. the action is necessary to alleviate health or safety
needs which are not reasonably satisﬁed by the con-
tractor, assignee, or their licensees;

3. the action is necessary to meet requirements for
public use speciﬁed by Federal regulations and such
requirements are not reasonably satisﬁed by the con-
tractor, assignee, or licensees; or

4. the action is necessary because the agreement required
by section 204 has not been obtained or waived or
because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell
any subject invention in the USA is in breach of its
agreement obtained pursuant to section 204.62

The regulations implementing the march-in provisions
establish a series of steps an agency must take before
marching in.63 In particular, the agency must notify the
contractor in writing if
it receives information that
might warrant the exercise of march-in rights.64 There-
after, the agency may, by written notice, inform a con-
tractor and its assignee or exclusive licensee that it is
considering the exercise of march-in rights.65 The de-
termination to exercise march-in rights is limited to
the head of the agency or a chosen designee.66 A con-
tractor may submit in person or in writing information
or argument in opposition to the proposed march in.67
If the information presented raises a ‘genuine dispute
over the material
facts’, the head of the agency or
the
designee must undertake fact-ﬁnding or

refer

ibid at 2197. The court also found that the Act’s provision allowing for
‘retention’ of an inventor’s rights was consistent with Stanford’s
argument because ‘[b]y using the word “retention,” §202(d) assumes
that the inventor had rights in the subject invention at some point,
undermining the notion that the Act automatically vests title to federally
funded inventions in federal contractors’, noting that its construction of
the Act was reﬂected in the common practice among parties operating
under the Act because contractors often have policies by which they
obtain assignments of inventions developed by their employees.
Although outside the focus of this article, the Federal Circuit’s
interpretation of the contested assignments here, although not addressed
by the Supreme Court’s decision, provide useful guidance for
government contractors operating under the Act.

A contractor has the right to challenge an agency’s
decision to march in. Section 203(b) dictates that an
administrative appeal procedure be established by regu-
lations promulgated in accordance with section 206 by
which ‘any contractor, inventor, assignee, or exclusive71
licensee’ may, within 60 days after an adverse determin-
ation under section 203(b), ﬁle a petition in the US
Court of Federal Claims for review.72 If the agency’s de-
termination is based on section 203(a)(1) or (3),
it
‘shall be held in abeyance pending the exhaustion of
appeals or petitions ﬁled’.73

Although the Act and regulations created detailed
procedures pertaining to march-in rights, to date no
agency has exercised those rights.74 A report by the US
Government Accountability Ofﬁce indicates that agen-
cies do not maintain ongoing efforts to identify poten-
tial candidates for march-in proceedings, although they
do monitor contractors’ compliance with reporting
requirements.75 The agencies surveyed reported that
they primarily rely on public and private sources, in-
cluding ‘news reports,
interest groups, and potential
competitors’, to provide information relevant to a po-
tential march-in proceeding.

NIH is the only agency that has received march-in
petitions, and in each instance declined to march-in.76
In 1997, in response to a petition by CellPro, Inc. per-
taining to stem cells, NIH determined that 35 USC
section 203(a)(1) and (2) did not apply because there
was no unmet health need not reasonably satisﬁed by

the licensee, and the licensee had taken steps to achieve
invention.77 In
practical application of
2004, NIH rejected two march-in petitions, requesting
that NIH march in to lower the price of two drug pro-
ducts,78 having determined that the march-in provi-
sions were not an appropriate means for controlling
drug prices, a matter it felt was better addressed by
Congress, and that any alleged anticompetitive behav-
iour was more appropriately addressed by the US
Federal Trade Commission.

The most recent petition, in 2010, requested that the
NIH march in under section 203(a)(2) because the li-
censee was not producing an adequate supply of Fabra-
zymew, a drug used to treat Fabry Disease:79 although
NIH acknowledged that the licensee experienced past
manufacturing issues, no available march-in remedy
would address the supply shortage because it would
take years for another manufacturer to receive market-
ing approval from the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the current licensee was working to restore a
full supply of the drug in the near future.

Although no Federal agency has exercised its march-
in rights, the ability to do so remains an important
tool
in ensuring contractor compliance with the
requirements under the Act.

Preference for US industry
In keeping with the explicit purpose of the Act, section
204 contains a speciﬁc preference for manufacturing in
the USA. Under this provision, small business ﬁrms
and non-proﬁt organizations,80 which receive title to a
subject invention, may not grant to any person the ex-
clusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the
USA, unless ‘such person agrees that any products em-
bodying the subject invention or produced through the
use of the subject invention will be manufactured sub-
stantially in the United States’.81 There are two limited
exceptions to this restriction, based on a showing that

(1) ‘reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made
to grant licences on similar terms to potential licensees
that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the
United States’; or (2) ‘under the circumstances domes-
tic manufacture is not commercially feasible’.82

Conﬁdentiality
Recognizing the importance of protecting the disclosure
of an invention to the public, the Act authorizes agen-
cies to withhold from the public ‘information disclosing
any invention in which the Federal Government owns
or may own a right, title, or interest . . . for a reasonable
time in order for a patent application to be ﬁled’.83 The
Act also provides that agencies are not required to
release copies of ‘any document which is part of an ap-
plication for patent’, whether ﬁled in the US Patent and
Trademark Ofﬁce or any foreign patent ofﬁce.84

The implementing regulations preclude agency dis-
closure of a subject invention before a patent applica-
tion is ﬁled, even in response to requests under the
Freedom of Information Act.85 In addition, agencies
may not disclose copies of documents included in a
patent application for a period of 18 months following
the application’s ﬁling date.86 The limitation of dissem-
ination, however, applies only to information submit-
ted as part of the patent rights provisions and is not
intended to preclude disclosure of information submit-
ted to an agency as part of a technical report or other
submission.87

to protect federally owned inventions.88 Each federal
agency is authorized to:

1. apply for, obtain, and maintain patents or other
forms of protection in the USA and in foreign coun-
tries on inventions in which the Federal Government
owns a right, title, or interest;

2. grant non-exclusive, exclusive, or partially exclusive
licences under federally owned inventions, royalty-
free or for royalties or other consideration, and on
such terms and conditions, including the grant to
the licensee of the right of enforcement pursuant to
the provisions of chapter 29 of this title89 as deter-
mined appropriate in the public interest;

3. undertake all other suitable and necessary steps to
protect and administer rights to federally owned
inventions on behalf of
the Federal Government
either directly or through contract . . . ;

4. transfer custody and administration, in whole or in
part, to another Federal agency, of the right, title, or
interest in any federally owned invention.90

The ability to grant the right of enforcement to a licen-
see substantially decreases the burden and cost to an
agency by allowing the licensee to maintain a patent in-
fringement suit without joining the federal agency as a
party. The Federal Circuit found that the statute pro-
vided an exception to the general rule91 that a patent
owner must be joined, either voluntarily or involuntar-
ily, in any patent infringement suit brought by an ex-
clusive licensee of a government-owned patent having
fewer than all substantial patent rights.92 In Nutrition

statute and legislative history are silent on whether a
private party licensee can bring suit without joining the
USA or the agency owning the patent as a co-party, the

Licensing of federally owned inventions
Although federal agencies are authorized to issue
non-exclusive,
exclusive
licences for federally owned inventions under section
207(a)(2), that authority is not unlimited.96 Section
209 sets
for various
licences. First, an agency may grant an exclusive or
partially exclusive licence only if
it determines that
ﬁve criteria are met: (1) the licence is a ‘reasonable
and necessary incentive to’ (A) raise the investment
capital and expenditures needed to bring the inven-
tion to practical application or
(B) promote the
invention’s utilization by the public;97 (2) the agency
ﬁnds that the public will be served by the granting of
the licence and the ‘proposed scope of exclusivity is
not greater than reasonably necessary to provide the
incentive for bringing the invention to practical appli-
cation . . . or otherwise to promote the invention’s
utilization by the public’;98 (3) the applicant makes ‘a
commitment to achieve practical application of the
invention within a reasonable time’;99 (4) granting
the licence will not ‘tend to substantially lessen com-
petition or create or maintain a violation of
the
Federal antitrust laws’,100 and (5) in the case of an

Federal agency as a party as determined appropriate in the public

plaintiff did, before ﬁling an infringement action.
See 35 USC §209 (2006); 37 CFR §404.5 (2011). The regulations
implementing 35 USC §§207 to 209 provide for the right to appeal ‘any
decision or determination concerning the grant, denial, modiﬁcation, or
termination of a licence’: 37 CFR §404.11(a) (2011). The right to
appeal, however, is limited to (1) a person whose application for a

cation,
‘the interests of the Federal Government or
United States industry in foreign commerce will be

Secondly, the Act repeats its preference for manufac-
turing in the USA. Under the Act, an agency ‘shall nor-
mally’ grant an exclusive, non-exclusive, or partially
exclusive licence under section 207(a)(2) to use or sell
any federally owned invention in the USA ‘only to a li-
censee who agrees that any products embodying the in-

Fourthly, the Act provides that any licence granted
under section 207(a)(2) must at least contain provi-
sions

1. ‘retaining a nontransferable,

irrevocable, paid-up
licence for any Federal agency to practice the inven-
tion or have the invention practised throughout the
world by or on behalf of the Government of the

§211: ‘Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to convey to any person
immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create any defenses to

ability to require overly burdensome reporting by permitting such
reporting ‘only to the extent necessary to enable the Federal agency to
determine whether the terms of the licence are being complied with’. An
agency must treat a licensee’s report as ‘commercial and ﬁnancial

whole or in part if the agency determines that any
one of four circumstances have occurred:106

(A) the licensee is not ‘executing its commitment107
to achieve practical application of the invention’
and cannot otherwise demonstrate that ‘it has
taken, or can be expected to take within a rea-
sonable time, effective steps to achieve practical
application of the invention’;108

(B) the licensee is in breach of an agreement to
manufacture any products embodying the in-
vention or produced through the use of the in-
vention substantially in the USA;109

(C) termination is ‘necessary to meet requirements
for public use speciﬁed by Federal regulations
issued after the date of the licence, and such
requirements are not reasonably satisﬁed by the
licensee’;110 or

laws

A ﬁfth and important requirement in the licensing of
federally owned inventions is public notice. Section
209(e) speciﬁes that public notice of an intention to
grant an exclusive or partially exclusive licence under
section 207(a)(2) on a federally owned invention must
be provided ‘in an appropriate manner’ at least 15 days
before such a licence is granted.112 Such notice offers
an opportunity for the public to provide comments to
the noticing agency regarding the proposed licence ar-
rangement. The agency must ﬁrst consider all com-

information obtained from a person and privileged and conﬁdential and
not subject to disclosure under’ the Freedom of Information Act.

106 35 USC §209(d)(3) (2006); see 37 CFR §404.5(b)(8)(i)– (v) (2011).
107 These commitments include those ‘contained in any plan submitted in

support of [a licensee’s] request for a licence’. 35 USC §209(d)(3)(A)
(2006).

108 35 USC §209(d)(3)(A) (2006).
109 35 USC §209(d)(3)(B) (2006).
110 35 USC §209(d)(3)(C) (2006).
111 35 USC §209(d)(3)(D) (2006).
112 35 USC §209(e) (2006). 37 CFR §404.7(a)(1)(i) provides that notice of

a prospective exclusive, co-exclusive, or partially exclusive domestic
licence must identify (1) the invention and (2) the prospective licensee,
and must be published in the Federal Register with an opportunity for
ﬁling written objections within at least a 15-day period: 37 CFR
§404.7(a)(1)(i) (2011).

113 ibid, §209(e), however, does not apply to the licensing of inventions

under a ‘cooperative research and development agreement entered into
under section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act
1980 (15 USC §3710a)’. That Act, inter alia, created the mechanisms by
which federal agencies and their laboratories can transfer technology: see
generally 35 USC §3710a (2006).

ments received before the end of the comment period
in response to the public notice.113 Although an agency
is required to give notice, its failure to do so is not ne-
cessarily fatal where the party challenging the licence
has actual notice of the agency’s intent.114 Further, an
agency’s decision to extend the term of an exclusive
licence does not trigger section 209(e)’s notice require-
ment.115

Finally, the party requesting a licence must submit a
plan ‘for development or marketing of the invention’
before receiving any licence under a patent or patent
application on a federally owned invention.116 As with
a licensee’s reports under section 209(d)(2), a plan sub-
mitted under section 209(f) must also be treated ‘as
commercial and ﬁnancial information obtained from a
person and privileged and conﬁdential and not subject
to disclosure under’
Information
Act.117

the Freedom of

An issue that frequently arises is whether a private
party can challenge an agency’s decision to licence a
subject invention under the Act. An accused infringer
may allege, as a defence to a patent-infringement suit,
that the agency’s decision to licence a subject invention
and the resulting licence violates one or more of the
procedural or substantive requirements of the Act. In
such circumstances, courts consistently have found that
the Act does not authorize a private cause of action
to enforce its provisions and thus the party lacks
standing.

In Service Engineering Corp. v United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, the court determined that plaintiffs
lacked standing to contest the US Department of Agri-
culture’s
(USDA) decision to grant an exclusive
licence.118 The plaintiffs had argued that the agency’s

114 In Southern Research Institute, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the

National Technical Information Service’s (NTIS) failure to notice its
intent publicly to award an exclusive licence was not subject to judicial
review because the complaining party had actual notice of the agency’s
intent and yet did not object: 938 F.2d at 1253. The complaining party
thus ‘failed to exhaust a non-futile administrative remedy and thus may
not obtain judicial review of the NTIS licence . . . under 35 USC §§207
and 209 and the applicable regulations’.

115 In Service Engineering Corp. v United States Department of Agriculture,
the US District Court for the District of Maryland determined that an
agency decision to extend an exclusive licence without publishing notice
of its intent to do so was a reasonable interpretation of the regulations
because (1) patent licences may be modiﬁed upon mutual agreement of
the Federal agency and the licensee in accordance with 37 CFR
§404.5(b)(10); and (2) 37 CFR §404.7(a)(1)(i) does not require public
notice of the term of a potential licence; rather, it requires identifying
the invention and the prospective licensee. No 97-833, 1999 US Dist.

exclusive licence should be transformed into a non-ex-
clusive licence because the agency failed to notify prop-
erly the prospective licensee in the public notice
required by the Act.119 The court did not address the
plaintiffs’ challenge, ﬁnding instead that they lacked
standing because their interests were not among those
that Congress arguably sought to protect in the Act.
Further, the plaintiffs failed to bid on the licence or
object to the agency’s notice of intent to licence the in-
vention during the comment period.120 Thus the court
granted the USDA’s motion for summary judgment.121
In Gen-Probe Inc. v Center for Neurologic Study, the
court followed the decisions in several earlier cases,
ﬁnding that defendants lacked standing to assert a
counterclaim for a constructive trust based on section
202 because the statute did not create a private right of
action to enforce its provisions.122 The court noted
that ‘no court has concluded that a private right of
action exists under Section 202. In fact, every court
that has considered the issue has reached the opposite
conclusion’.123 Accordingly, the court dismissed defend-
ants’ counterclaim.

Precedence of chapter
The Act also sets forth a hierarchal sequence for decid-
ing any conﬂicts with existing or future Acts. Speciﬁc-
ally, the Act ‘takes precedence over any other Act which
would require a disposition of rights in subject inven-
tions of small business ﬁrms or nonproﬁt organizations
contractors in a manner that is inconsistent with this
chapter’.124 The Act takes precedence over any future
Act ‘unless that Act speciﬁcally cites this Act and pro-
vides that it shall take precedence over this Act’.125

Implications for business concerns
The statutory scheme of the Act is fraught with poten-
tial pitfalls for the unwary. Contractors must be aware
of the scope of the Act and understand when the gov-

ernment may have rights to an invention. An invention
conceived with private funds, but reduced to practice
with the use of government funds, may result in gov-
ernment rights to the invention. As discussed above, it
is not always clear when a particular invention is a
‘subject invention’, thus triggering government rights.
Contractors should focus on the scope of work pro-
vided in the funding agreement and determine whether
the invention directly resulted from the work per-
formed under that agreement or simply related to, or
built upon, the knowledge gained under a government-
funded project. It is prudent for federal contractors
and their employees to delineate clearly the scope of
work performed under funding agreements with gov-
ernment agencies to maintain clear lines between such
work and work performed under private funding
arrangements.

Secondly, employers should structure employment
agreements to require present assignments of any in-
vention made by an employee during the course of
their employment. Without an assignment, the invent-
or may retain full rights to the invention and thereby
preclude both the employer and potentially the govern-
ment agency from having rights in an invention. This
often depends on the terms of the funding agreement
and whether the inventor/employee is a party to the
agreement or whether the agreement is solely between
the employer and the federal agency. Contractors
should carefully review their contractual arrangements
with subcontractors and any agreements their employ-
ees may be asked to sign regarding assignment of IP
rights when working at other institutions or in tempor-
ary positions with other contractors to ensure that the
contractor’s rights are fully protected.

Thirdly, contractors must understand the various
time requirements of the Act. Employees should bring
potential inventions promptly to the attention of the
employer/contractor. The contractor then must ad-
equately disclose those inventions to the funding agency

provisions over which it takes precedence, although it clearly indicates
that the universe of precedence is not limited to the 21 listed. 35 USC
§210(a)(1) –(21) (2006). Further, the Act has no effect on legislation
that governs ‘the disposition of rights in inventions made in the
performance of funding agreements with persons other than nonproﬁt
organizations or small business ﬁrms’: 35 USC §210(b) (2006).

125 35 USC §210(a) (2006). The additional subsections of §210 provide
further limitations on the precedence of the Act, including that the
provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act 1980
take precedence over ‘the provisions of this chapter to the extent that
they permit or require a disposition of rights in subject inventions
which is inconsistent with this chapter’: 35 USC §210(e) (2006).

or agencies. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture
of patent rights in a subject invention. If a contractor
discovers after the fact
that an invention was not
timely disclosed to a federal agency, in most instances
the contractor
should promptly notify the agency
upon such discovery. The agency is likely to respond
either by permitting the contractor to elect to retain
rights or rejecting such retention. If the agency rejects
the contractor’s retention of rights, at a minimum, the
contractor could limit the investment and expense of
developing and marketing the invention, rather than
investing resources in the development of the inven-
tion only to discover years later that the contractor’s
title is voidable.

Fourthly, contractors

should understand what

it
means to be ‘manufactured substantially’ in the USA. Al-
though the term is deﬁned in neither the statute nor the
governing regulations, analogous legislation can provide
a clue to a likely agency interpretation. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration deﬁnes ‘Manufac-
tured substantially in the United States’ to mean ‘the
product must have over 50 percent of its components
manufactured in the United States’.126 The regulations

One attractive option for foreign contractors

government agencies, waivers should be obtained from
each.
