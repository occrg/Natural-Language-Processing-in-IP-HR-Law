utaklimpke@web.deWhile the conservation efforts and constraints in the medieval town of Quedlinburg are
typical of the conditions in the smaller historic towns in the former German Democratic
Republic, they also resemble those of small heritage towns in other countries. Shifts and
changes are assessed for a time frame of about 25 years, before and after the pivotal event
of German reunification of 1990. Located in a previously prosperous but now depressed
region with more than 20% unemployment, Quedlinburg has suffered from the breakdown
of the former agricultural and other industries in the region after 1990 and subsequent out-
migration. Some valuable historic buildings were lost before 1990, owing to neglect and lack
of funding. Since then, improved funding, combined with public–private partnership, has
helped  the  town  to  make  very  considerable  conservation  progress.  The  town’s  World
Heritage status since 1994 has been utilised as a significant supporting factor in tourism
promotion, which has become an important part of the ongoing conservation processes.

The  principal  urban  development  alternative—historic  preservation  versus  area
renewal—has been subject to debate for decades, in both East and West, in prosperous
countries much more than in poor ones, because rich countries have more options
open, while poorer ones might either not want to preserve their heritage because they
would be more interested in modernisation, or they just cannot afford the luxury of

historic preservation. In any case, the general political, economic, and social conditions
of a country largely determine the fate of the built heritage. This paper looks at a small
historic town in a particularly challenging regional situation that is relevant to many
heritage towns in other countries. Thus the specific conditions in central Germany that
are considered here may well be compared with those in other parts of the world where
the political setting has changed radically. In particular, the transition economies in
Eastern  Europe  are  struggling  with  the  difficult  problem  of  balancing  economic
development and heritage protection.

For  clearly  defined  political  reasons,  the  German  Democratic  Republic  and  the
Federal Republic of Germany took predictably different routes in this particular field
of urban management. The rich historic fabric of the urban and rural environment (as
well  as  the  institutional  framework)  was  largely  the  same  in  1945,  except  for  local
differences in relation to how much had been destroyed by the war. In 1990, however,
when both states merged after more than 40 years of separation, the conditions in East
and  West  had  become  radically  different.  There  was  widespread  public–private
management,  specific  legislation,  and  generally  sharpened  public  awareness  in  the
West, in contrast to limited government action, combined with neglect and continued
heavy losses in the East. Over the four intervening decades, professional discussion and
public awareness in both parts of Germany went through comparable shifts in opinion
as to what to do with the rich historical inheritance, but the timing, the means, and the
results differed considerably.

The  case  of  Quedlinburg  is  representative  of  many  smaller  historic  towns  in  the
former  German  Democratic  Republic,  and  their  transformation  during  the  past  15
years since reunification. This is the pivotal period that this article tries to explore, with
regard to physical changes and the underlying shifts in policy, financing, and legisla-
tion. The 10th anniversary of Quedlinburg’s inscription in the World Heritage List in
December 2004 adds a special reason for reflection; how much has this internationally
recognised status contributed to conservation management and urban development in
the town?

East and West German Developments in Heritage Conservation

It is probably true that by 1970 cities in both states had lost much more historic fabric
since the Second World War than during those dreadful six years. This was in the name
of  economic  progress  and  social  reform  in  both  states—as  in  all  other  industrial
countries. Twenty years later, however, the losses in the East had gone from bad to
worse, while those in the West had given way to widespread urban conservation. At
present, 15 years after the reunification, the differences on both sides of the former
border  have  not  disappeared,  but  urban  conservation  in  East  and  West  is  now
subjected to the same legislation and largely identical arguments in public debate.

In  the  West,  public  awareness  of  the  significance  of  historic  urban  fabric  has
steadily increased since the early 1970s, both as a counter-movement to the spirit of
modernisation and reconstruction in the post-war period and as a consequence of the
slowdown  after  the  economic  boom  of  the  previous  two  decades.  Although

principally different because of the socialist ideology which did not allow private land
ownership  and  entrepreneurship,  an  increasing  recognition  of  historic  buildings
occurred in the East as well, where several national monument lists were set up during
that time.

The main policies adopted mark the differences much more clearly than the appar-
ent similarities in changing public awareness. In West Germany the most important
special  legislation  for  urban  renewal  and  conservation  (Städtebauförderungsgesetz)
came  into  force  in  1971.  It  shifted  the  emphasis  from  urban  expansion  and  new
construction to consolidation and rehabilitation, promoting economic development of
city  centres,  and  creating  opportunities  for  better  protection  of  historic  buildings,
especially by providing generous public financial support to privately owned historic
properties. On the other side of the border, historic quarters continued to be badly
neglected.  Since  house  ownership  was  tolerated  only  for  small  properties,  all  rental
housing had been socialised. So the typical 19th-century quarters of the larger cities
were falling apart, and as late as 1988 large areas of historic city areas were earmarked
for bulldozing, especially in large cities like Leipzig and Dresden. The state had to put
priority  on  creating  new  housing  but  not  conservation  of  old  city  quarters,  and
occupants who paid only minimal rents had no means of rescuing the buildings from
further decay. Understandably, most people were looking forward to moving into the
thousands  of  modern  new  dwellings  that  had  been  provided  in  prefabricated  slab
construction outside the city centres. In 1990, the year of German reunification, most
East German city centres were in a very poor condition, while in West German cities it
had become chic to live in carefully preserved inner-city apartments that had been fitted
with modern amenities.

For some time after 1990, the disastrous situation of historic core areas in the Eastern
regions was further aggravated by the construction of large modern shopping malls
outside the town centres, much in the same way as in West Germany in the late 1960s.
In the East, this development took place in the legislative vacuum of the first five to
seven years, which was used shamelessly by investors from the West, until new legisla-
tion came into effect. In the West, the same trend of economic drainage of historic
town centres had been at least partially halted by the special legislation of 1971. It was
designed to strengthen the municipal tax base in the inner city as well as respond to
pro-conservation  trends  in  public  opinion.  This  had  led  to  a  reversal  of  the  out-
migration from the inner city—a trend which still prevails in Eastern cities, and in most
of the Eastern regions.

The economic restructuring of the past 15 years has created measurable transforma-
tions in the regions and towns in the Eastern part of Germany.1 A research team at the
University  of  Cologne  has  undertaken  a  remarkable  series  of  surveys  in  four  small
towns at the rim of the northern Harz Mountains since 1989, including Quedlinburg.
With the former border now open, visitors and residents in those towns have direct
competition from similar historic towns 50 km further west, both as tourist destina-
tions and as shopping or job opportunities. One of the main research findings for the
town centres is that retail and service structures gradually assume the same character-
istics as in the West.2

Germany now has 30 World Heritage Sites, including several small and medium-
sized historic towns. The Association of German World Heritage Sites has become a
strong  advocate  for  exchanging  information  among  the  sites,  promoting  cultural
tourism,  and  heritage-town  marketing.  In  similar  ways,  the  independent  German
Foundation  for  Monument  Protection  (Deutsche  Stiftung  Denkmalschutz)  provides
support and promotion but, above all, extends generous financial support to munici-
palities in need. To some extent such organisations complement the public funding
and management functions that are shared by the three levels of government (federal,
state, and municipal). Concepts such as this mix of funding sources, and the multiplic-
ity  of  stakeholders  were  new  to  the  authorities  in  Quedlinburg,  when  the  town
prepared for its second, and then successful, nomination bid for the World Heritage
List in 1992, shortly after the Wende (’the turn of the tide’) in 1989–1990.

A Regional Profile of Quedlinburg

Founded  in  922,  Quedlinburg  was  one  of  the  most  important  European  political
centres of the early Middle Ages. For about two centuries it was the capital of the East
Franconian  German  Empire,  ruled  by  the  Ottonian  kings  who  had  created  and
reshaped a new German state after the demise of Charlemagne’s Franconian empire.
The first German emperor, Heinrich I, is buried in the Romanesque basilica that domi-
nates the image of Quedlinburg, from Castle Hill above the medieval town. The deep
historical significance, together with the existence of an extraordinary large number of
half-timber  buildings  within  a  well-preserved  medieval  city  structure  justified  the
inclusion of Quedlinburg into the World Heritage List in 1994. The official name is
Collegiate Church, Castle and Old Town of Quedlinburg (see Figures 1 and 2)

Quedlinburg shares the typical factors that are conducive to keeping old cities intact
over  several  centuries,  confirming  the  well-known  scenario  of  formerly  rich  and
powerful centres ultimately turned into quaint little ‘heritage towns’. After the early
‘imperial’ period, the town developed as an important centre of trade and crafts. A few
centuries  after  its  foundation,  Quedlinburg  gained,  and  retained,  its  medieval
structure,  with  the  elements  that  have  now  been  recognised  by  the  World  Heritage
inscription—Castle Hill with the basilica, the so-called Old Town, and, adjacent to it,
the ‘New Town’ laid out in the 15th century.

The railway connection at the end of the 19th century gave the town an economic
push,  with  new  specialised  industries  and  a  belt  of  outstanding  Art  Nouveau  style

144 U. Klimpke & H. D. Kammeier

buildings around the medieval core area. However, limited industrial development did
not  lead  to  overbuilding  and  destruction  of  the  medieval  core,  and  besides,  it  was
apparently  well  managed  by  a  proud  municipal  council  that  chose  to  maintain  the
medieval town without transforming it. The Old Town of Quedlinburg constitutes one
of the largest urban monuments in Germany, comprising more than 1,200 half-timber
buildings spanning six centuries, but also some remarkable quarters that were added in
the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The unfortunate East/West divide is likely to last for another two decades or more,
despite the over-optimistic projections of 1990. The hard facts include unemployment
at an average of nearly 20% in the East, which is more than double that in the West.
Much of the state of Sachsen-Anhalt is a relatively remote economically weak region.
During GDR times, Quedlinburg flourished as a centre of flower cultivation and seed
production, which had developed from the 19th century as one of the most important
in Europe. The town also became an important tourist destination for day visitors who
came to see the ‘flower city’ as much as its medieval setting.

After  1990  the  economic  structure  of  the  town  changed  entirely.  In  the  county,
about  6,500  agricultural  jobs  out  of  a  total  of  8,000  had  been  lost  within  six  years,
because the seed production industries were killed off by the private firms that took
over the state-run companies. The unemployment rate has been at a constant 24% for
10 years, and the town’s population shrank from 28,000 (1990) to its current 23,000.
While the steadily increasing number of overnight visitors opened up new employ-
ment opportunities in tourist accommodation and catering, the number of overnight
stays is still rather small compared to other historic cities. Seasonal fluctuations are
high, and local economic benefits are limited mainly to tourism businesses whereas
the community as a whole continues to have serious economic problems. In this way
the  town  is  still  far  from  the  predictable  stages  of  tourism  saturation  or  fatigue.3  It
could well cope with much more, without losing its character, but it takes considerable
imagination  to  envisage  the  volume  of  cultural  tourism  (and  other  options)  that
would be needed to compensate fully for the economic opportunities that have been
lost.

Quedlinburg Restoration before and after 1990: Facts and Figures

In this section, as well as in the article as a whole, the emphasis is on contrasting the
factors influencing urban conservation, as an explanation of the significant changes
over  time.  It  is  probably  best  to  begin  with  an  annotated  overall  statistic  that  was
compiled from many different sources (see Table 1). The stock of half-timber houses
within  the  Conservation  Area  remained  nearly  constant  at  around  1,300,  but  their
general condition was very different, as the 1990 figure of 500 heavily damaged and
dilapidated houses suggests. The figures on houses maintained by private owners are
interesting as they show that despite rigid socialist laws on privately owned real estate,
the small parcels and houses in a town like Quedlinburg were actually maintained and
repaired by their owners. After 1990, more than 80% of the houses were repaired and
restored,  with  public  subsidies.  A  distinction  has  to  be  made  between  immediate

protection measures (e.g. roof repairs), and partial or full modernisation of sanitation,
kitchens, insulation, and other improvements. All of the restored houses retained their
authentic historic appearance. Furthermore, the changing scale of public involvement
is shown by the fact that only 26 houses were restored with public funding before 1990
compared with more than 1,000 after 1990.

Long before 1990, most of the town had already been listed as a protected monu-
ment. In 1961 it was included on a list of monuments of special importance; then in
1979  the  Old  Town  with  Collegiate  Church,  Wiperti  Church  and  Münzenberg  was
inscribed into the central monument list of the GDR,4 and the local monument protec-
tion office pursued a firm conservation policy for the entire Old Town and its vicinity.
However, this still included the option of demolition and replacement to an extent that
would not have been acceptable ten years later.

Principles: Urban Renewal versus Preservation

Demolition and rebuilding would have continued, especially in the run-down north-
ern parts of the Old Town, if the situation had not been turned around by the end of
that political system. When the government applied for World Heritage nomination of
Quedlinburg in 1987 the proposal was rejected because of the pending plan for large-
scale demolition. The second application was concluded successfully with the inscrip-
tion of Quedlinburg in December 1994.

Historic  half-timber  buildings  are  especially  sensitive  to  moisture  and  therefore
need  continuous  maintenance.  Having  survived  the  Second  World  War  virtually
without  damage,  most  of  the  historic  fabric  of  Quedlinburg  began  to  be  neglected
because of a shortage of building materials and skilled craftsmen, both of which were
a  consequence  of  the  politically  motivated  closure  of  small  manufacturing  and
construction firms.

To cope with an urgent demand for housing in the 1960s the city council proposed
to pull down large parts of the historic area and to resettle the residents in new dwell-
ings with modern sanitary standards in five-storey prefabricated concrete buildings.5
Luckily  the  conservation  institute  was  able  to  prevent  the  implementation  of  the
demolition plans, but many people subsequently moved into the more attractive new
dwellings erected outside the centre, and the historic fabric decayed further.

In the mid-1980s a number of vacant houses in the northern corner of the Old Town
were  in  such  a  bad  condition  that  they  had  to  be  demolished.  These  houses  were
replaced by semi-prefab constructions that had been especially adapted to fit into the
historic built environment: three-storey concrete slab buildings with steep tiled roofs
and diverse façades, known as HMB/Q (Hallesche Monolithbauweise Typ Quedlinburg).
It was planned to replace the dilapidated fabric by such new buildings in large parts of
Quedlinburg (see Figures 3 and 4). This was an attempt to create new structures in
harmony with the medieval town, while keeping construction costs low. Conservation-
ists’  opinions  differ  considerably  about  this  particular  method  of  bridging  the  gap
between  old  and  new  by  ‘sympathetic  infill’,  even  though  this  type  of  construction
received a national prize at the time. It would be more difficult to defend this kind of

construction  nowadays,  but  it  must  be  said  that  the  project  was  a  fair  compromise
between adapted style and low costs.

Side by side with public (re-)construction measures, the support of the private sector
was in action without any public financial support and without much planning guid-
ance, as most of the half-timber buildings were in fact maintained by their owners.
Owing to the shortage of materials, they had to use brick instead of wood for repairing
timber frames, and concrete roofing materials to replace traditional clay tiles. However,
this shortage fortuitously also led to the retention of much of the authentic substance
in  Quedlinburg  because  modifications  were  limited  to  a  necessary  minimum—a
cautious approach resulting from economic constraints.

Nevertheless, by 1990 most of the then 1,300 half-timber houses were in a very poor
condition;  roofs  and  chimneys  were  damaged,  doors  and  side  walls  were  missing,
façades were sinking due to broken ceiling beams which were collapsing owing to the
presence of moisture. One hundred and fifty houses were in danger of collapse. Thus

right at the beginning of the new era, 340 houses had to be rescued through immediate
protection measures.6

The New Legal and Financing Framework

German reunification offered the opportunity for a systematic urban restoration policy
that  was  financed  or  subsidised  by  government,  with  renewed  encouragement  of
private investment. In this context different zones were set up for planning and financ-
ing purposes, beginning in 1991. Their characteristics are presented in Table 2 and an
overview map is shown in Figure 6. As the map and the summary table show, urban
conservation in a German town is the result of a variety of complementary and ‘inter-
locking’ plans and policies governed by different laws. Although carried out largely by
the municipal offices, the sources of finance come from all three levels of government:
federal, state (Land), and local authority.

Explanatory note: the Conservation Area and, within it, the Restoration Area were introduced under German federal legislation to demarcate areas that are eligible for different types of public funding. For the World Heritage nomination and inscription, a smaller area was defined
as World Heritage Area. It comprises the following five historical areas: ‘Old’ (32 ha) and ‘New’ Towns (36.5 ha), Westendorf with Castle Hill and Collegiate Church (16 ha), Münzenberg (2.5 ha), Gröper Vorstadt, Neuweger Vorstadt and Wiperti Church (6 ha). The surrounding protective area—the buffer zone—stretches up to the borders of the previously defined Conservation Area.

The urban development framework plan (Städtebaulicher Rahmenplan) is a standard
component of urban management in Germany which goes beyond the formal require-
ments for the standard land-use plan (Flächennutzungsplan). As a working document
it includes concepts for the image of the city, land use and traffic. Because of the large
size of the Restoration Area (180 ha) these concepts are also set out in further detail for
selected smaller areas.

The strictest regulations were fixed for the World Heritage Area. The aims that were
formulated in 1995 by the state-level monument protection office (framework of objec-
tives, revised 1998) are reflected in a 1999 design ordinance (Gestaltungssatzung). This
is a very detailed explanation of what is recommended and forbidden in conservation,
renewal and advertising action that may or may not be undertaken by property owners
within the World Heritage Area. The definition of ‘incompatible street furniture’ (the
disturbing appearance of blue dustbins, freestanding letterboxes, flashing or dazzling
advertising  lights  on  hotels,  shops  and  restaurants,  slate  roofs  and  plastic  gutters),
creates typical conflicts among preservation authority, residents and tourism operators.
Under the Urban Improvement Act (1971) now in force, municipalities normally
contract  a  suitable  private  or  semi-public  agency  specialised  in  implementing
conservation  planning  and  financing,  directly  interacting  with  private  property
owners. In Quedlinburg, one such company, BauBeCon Restoration, was appointed to
coordinate and implement most measures in the Conservation Area. The considerable
progress in improving the quality and the image of the city since 1990 can be seen from
the summary in Table 3, with some illustrations in Figures 7 and 8 (a counter-example
is added in Figure 9).

Around 10% of the houses have not yet been restored, largely because their owners
are unknown. Some owners live far away and have neither interest in the buildings nor
money for their restoration. The costs of restoration, adaptation or modernisation of
half-timber buildings are very high and, in addition, redeveloped half-timber buildings
need continuous maintenance, and the costs in relation to insurance and fire-protec-
tion measures are high as well. Strict regulations forbid the use of cheaper prefabricated
building materials for the repair of fences or roofs, especially for houses registered as

Explanatory note: the Conservation Area and, within it, the Restoration Area were intro-
duced under German federal legislation to demarcate areas that are eligible for different
types of public funding. For the World Heritage nomination and inscription, a smaller area
was defined as World Heritage Area. It comprises the following five historical areas: ‘Old’
(32 ha) and ‘New’ Towns (36.5 ha), Westendorf with Castle Hill and Collegiate Church (16
ha), Münzenberg (2.5 ha), Gröper Vorstadt, Neuweger Vorstadt and Wiperti Church (6
ha). The surrounding protective area—the buffer zone—stretches up to the borders of the
previously defined Conservation Area.

monuments. Other buildings are unattractive as a result of their location (no car access
or being affected by traffic noise) or small plot size. All in all there are thus some 250
vacant buildings (190 half-timber, and 60 brick houses), representing some 13% of the
housing stock in the Conservation Area.

Financing Urban Conservation

Compared with other small historic towns in East Germany after 1990, Quedlinburg
received an especially large amount of public finance from many sources. It is almost
impossible to provide exact figures on the investments, especially because there are no
statistics on private property owners’ own spending. The total value of public invest-
ments  from  1990  to  2001  has  been  estimated  at  some  DM225  million,  as  shown  in
Table 4.7

It is well known that public investments in infrastructure as well as tax incentives and
subsidies trigger a considerable amount of money invested by property owners. The
multiplier  effect  for  public  subsidies  was  found  to  be  between  1:3  for  thorough
modernisations and 1:6.5 for partial modernisations.8 Similar figures have been known
from many urban conservation projects elsewhere in Germany. Based on such ratios,
the total value of private investments in conservation measures in Quedlinburg may be
realistically estimated at DM230–250 million. Thus the total monetary value of resto-
ration and modernisation measures up to the end of 2001 may have reached DM470
million (or  €230 million). This amounts to about  €10,000 per inhabitant—a huge
success for such a small town in a poor region.

Further progress in restoration and revitalisation depends heavily on the availability
of funds, both public and private. An official estimate of the municipality9 stated a sum
of at least DM600 million. At the past performance rate, that would require another 15
years of conservation effort. However, the weak economy of the region and the fact that
the municipality is heavily in debt does not bode well for such an optimistic projection.

Current Issues of Heritage Management

The Poor Regional Economy

Nearly all current issues of heritage management in Quedlinburg can be ascribed to
the root cause of persistently high unemployment in the region (which itself stems from
the  demise  of  the  previously  thriving  industries  after  1990),  which  gives  rise  to  low
purchasing  power  and  a  weak  tax  base,  affecting  public  and  private  investment  for
conservation. On the other hand, the region is not very attractive as a location for new
industries, which further aggravates the economic conditions. Against this background,
conflicts among urban development and conservation interests are predictable.

Even after World Heritage designation in 1994, several building projects were imple-
mented against the will of the conservation department and the respective regulations
that are in force. Conservation authorities at municipal and state level have a rather
weak position. As a result, they were unable to prevent a new construction project that
blocks the axial view to Castle Hill. Nevertheless, it was supported by the municipal
planning office (see Figure 9).

The conservation law of the state of Sachsen-Anhalt was modified in July 2003 to
ease private construction projects by lowering specific conservation requirements. As a

consequence, many owners of damaged buildings wait until repair can no longer be
postponed.  Rescue  measures  are  then  paid  in  full  from  public  funds  for  emergency
protection.  The  combination  of  scarce  public  funds  and  poor  or  uncooperative
property owners will make further losses in the built fabric unavoidable.

There are also typical conflicts between authentic preservation and modern develop-

ment requirements: 

● Cobblestone pavements and high kerbstones (required by the Design Ordinance) are

difficult to reconcile with the requirements for wheelchair access in public spaces.



155

● Residents would like some greenery in public spaces, but the overly rigid Design
Ordinance does not permit this because medieval marketplaces would not have had
trees.
Efforts to close the inner city to through traffic are making only slow progress. Plans
to close streets to through traffic are difficult to implement against shop owners’
protests.

The strict regulations arising from World Heritage status are slowing the social and
economic  revitalisation  process  as  buildings  have  become  too  expensive  and  too
demanding in terms of design requirements.

Tourism

Tourism  has  become  the  most  important  sector  of  the  economy,  with  considerable
success so far, even though it has not been able to compensate for the losses in the
county’s agricultural and industrial economy. The numbers of overnight visitors have
trebled, and the average length of stay has nearly doubled in 10 years (see Table 5). Day
visitors arriving by train and bus have reached an annual figure of about 1.2 million.

It would be wrong to ascribe most of the increase in visitor numbers to Quedlinburg’s
nomination as a World Heritage Site, although its impact may be felt in the long run.
The main reason for growing tourism in the Eastern German regions is the general
increase in wealth, apart from the fact that increasing numbers of West German tourists
have begun to ‘discover’ the formerly inaccessible towns in the East.

The  total  number  of  tourists  is  still  relatively  low,  except  for  some  short  peak
periods in spring and around Christmas. Special cultural events have been staged for a
number of years, such as the medieval town festival, an increasing number of summer
concerts, special museum shows, and Christmas markets. However, the employment
effects have not been as large and consistent as those observed in other heritage towns
around the world.10

Expanding high-quality cultural and conference tourism remains one of the most
important future development aims of the town. World Heritage status may help to
increase the international recognition of Quedlinburg so as to develop a kind of place
marketing  aimed  at  specific  target  groups.11  An  opportunity  to  enhance  arrival

numbers in November, January and February—the typical ‘dead months’ of the tour-
ism  business—would  be  to  promote  Quedlinburg  as  a  good  place  for  corporate
conferences, but so far the town does not seem to have the right image for that.

World  Heritage  status  may  also  help  in  the  town’s  efforts  to  attract  institutions
promoting intercultural exchange and university networking, thus creating an innova-
tive profile for the town, quite apart from enhancing local revenues. However, there is
still a long way to go in efforts to firmly establish the town’s image as a ‘culture city’
rather than its former image as a ‘flower city’.

Stakeholders’ Opinions on Development Prospects

Possibilities of future town development were the subject of a recent exploratory survey
among local experts.12 Several representatives of tourism businesses and marketing,
and  the  municipal  departments  of  culture  and  of  urban  planning  were  asked  to
comment on the options for local economic growth, the role of conservation, and, in
particular,  the  expected  effects  of  World  Heritage  status.  Opinions  differ  sharply
concerning those economic sectors that should come first in future town development.
Tourism, industry, trade and manufacture as well as seed production were all seen as
very important. However, almost all interviewees thought it unlikely that growing local
tourism  could  create  sufficient  jobs  within  the  next  10  years  to  prevent  population
numbers shrinking further.

Assessing the time-span needed to complete the urban restoration programme, all
interviewees—apart from the urban planning department, which takes a rather pessi-
mistic view of the future—believed that the urban restoration programme could be
completed within the next 20 years. In relation to the conditions, it was felt that the
significance of the city as a World Heritage Site must play a greater role in the media to
speed up the restoration programme.

Almost  all  interviewees  were  convinced  that  World  Heritage  status  will  help  to
protect the historic fabric. It was felt that the special ‘label’ would attract further hotel
business,  high-quality  retail  and  visitor  catering  if  this  factor  were  made  a  central
element in future place marketing—even though this is not yet supported by visitor
statistics. Perhaps the most active player in taking Quedlinburg to international visibil-
ity  is  a  small  family-financed  non-profit  organisation  known  as  Quitilinga  Culture
Projects.13

The completion of the regional highway link in 2007 will be a necessary condition
for  the  development  of  the  local  economy,  but  this  would  have  to  be  supported  by
improved railway connections to Hanover and Berlin.

Conclusion

Quedlinburg is a particularly interesting case of a small town in a poor region where
the after-effects of German reunification had devastating economic consequences. The
physical assets of the Old Town were in fact rescued by the same political turn, and
conditions were improved beyond any imagination of the pre-1990 period of neglect

and decay. However, the intended transformation from the previous ‘flower city’, the
thriving economy of a highly specialised form of agriculture, to that of a future centre
of cultural excellence has been exceedingly difficult and demanding.

Much has been achieved over the past 10 years. World Heritage status has become
one of the most important factors influencing the development of the town. However,
it must be supported by other improvements such as better regional transport connec-
tions, international town marketing, greater tourist attraction to the eastern part of the
Harz Mountains, and a consistently high standard of urban conservation.

A gradual change in the economic structure of the town is certainly expected in the
future, but it will take at least 10 years for such a change to be significantly different
from  the  present.  Cultural  and  conference  tourism  could  become  a  very  important
economic factor, in the same way it has become a core element in many other historic
towns, but World Heritage status alone cannot solve the socio-economic problems of
the town and the region.
