Comparative advertising and the tort
of generic disparagement
Arpan Banerjee*

What is disparagement?
Indian advertising made its tentative beginnings towards
the end of the eighteenth century.1 But as late as the
1980s, David Ogilvy noted that there was ‘very little
advertising’ in the country compared with the West.2 The
following decade saw the liberalization of the Indian
economy, greatly beneﬁting advertisers. India’s once-
dormant advertising industry has now leapfrogged to
become the world’s fourteenth-largest.3 Concomitantly,
disputes
stemming from comparative advertisements
have rapidly sprung up in the new free-market economy.
The Paris Convention for the Protection of Indus-
trial Property 1883 requires states to provide ‘effective
protection against unfair competition’.4 ‘Any act of
competition contrary to honest practices in industrial
or commercial matters’ amounts to unfair compe-
tition.5 This includes making ‘false allegations in the
course of trade of such a nature as to discredit the
establishment, the goods, or the industrial or commer-
cial activities, of a competitor’,6 which is known as dis-
paragement.7 Disparagement assumes great relevance in
the context of comparative advertisements. Trade mark
statutes are incapable of preventing the disparagement
of unidentiﬁed traders. However, Indian courts have
fashioned a tort of generic disparagement to offset this.
In this article, I compare English and Indian precedents
and argue that Indian judges have been more prag-
matic by relaxing certain barriers to liability in tortious
disparagement actions. However, only cases of speciﬁc
disparagement ought to be actionable. Arguably, recog-
nizing a tort of generic disparagement would result in
undue curbs on commercial speech and increase the
possibility of vexatious litigation.

Key issues
† In contrast with English courts, Indian courts
have regularly upheld tortious disparagement
claims and shown a greater willingness to infer
malicious intent.

† By ignoring English precedents in this area,
Indian courts have also developed a tort of
generic disparagement,
stressing the need to
protect consumers from misleading statements,
even if not targeted at a particular trader, and
have included venial pufﬁng and commercially
honest denigration within the ambit.

† The author argues that this has unduly curbed
commercial freedom of speech and opened the
ﬂoodgates for frivolous litigation among rival
businesses.

Disparagement and trade mark law
Law in the UK
Section 10(6) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (‘TMA’)
allows registered trade marks to be used ‘for the
purpose of identifying goods or services as those of
the proprietor or a licensee’. But if this use is ‘other-
wise than in accordance with honest practices
in
industrial or commercial matters’ and ‘without due
cause . . . is detrimental to, the distinctive character or
repute’ of the trade mark, it amounts to trade mark
infringement. This part of section 10(6) incorporated
the provisions of an EC Directive8 and seeks

prevent tarnishment, ie the use of a trade mark in an
unwholesome context likely to evoke negative associ-
ations with the trade mark by the public.9 In Barclays
v Advanta, Laddie J observed that, to attract liability
under this provision, the use of a trade mark ‘must
inﬂict some harm on the character or repute of the
registered mark which is above the level of de
minimis’.10 Since making false allegations about a
trader’s goods can inﬂict such harm and constitute
tarnishment, section 10(6) appears to indirectly prevent
disparagement.

In Barclays, Laddie J explained that if a trade mark’s
use ‘is considered honest by members of a reasonable
audience’, there is no infringement.11 The public is
accustomed to hyperbole and the TMA does not
impose ‘a more puritanical standard’. Hence, advertis-
ing which ‘pokes fun’ at competitors or merely puffs is
acceptable.12 Laddie J refused to restrain Advanta from
using ‘BARCLAYCARD’
in advertisements. Barclays
had contended that Advanta’s claim of offering ‘a
better credit card all round’ was not honest, as they
had not mentioned beneﬁts offered by Barclays. Laddie
J, however, thought that the advertisements would be
considered honest by a reasonable reader. In contrast,
in Emaco v Dyson,13 Dyson published a technical graph
and declared that their vacuum cleaner was superior to
Emaco’s. Parker J, applying Laddie J’s reasonable-reader
test, found ‘a number of false representations’ and con-
cluded that there was infringement.14

In addition to the TMA, an EC Directive15 (‘CAD’)
regulates the conditions for comparative advertising, ie
‘any advertising which explicitly or by implication
identiﬁes a competitor or goods or services offered by a
competitor’.16 The CAD codiﬁed the amended version
of
identical Directive
(‘MAD’).17 The CAD permits comparative advertising
if it, inter alia:18

By virtue of the Marleasing principle,20 the TMA ought
to be interpreted in accordance with the CAD.21 In
British Airways v Ryanair,22 Jacob J (as he then was) felt
that compliance with most of the MAD’s provisions
would ‘obviously be necessary to comply with section
10(6)’ of the TMA.23 But the CAD’s impact on the TMA
remains unclear.24 Particularly problematic is the CAD’s
use of the word ‘denigrate’, which ordinarily means ‘to
blacken, sully, or stain (character or reputation)’.25 Argu-
ably, denigration differs slightly from disparagement. Fal-
sehood is an indispensable ingredient of disparagement
but not necessarily of denigration. Even true statements
can blacken traders.26 Unlike the TMA, the CAD lacks a
commercial-honesty proviso. What impact does the CAD
then have on a commercially honest advertisement
which, in Laddie J’s words, ‘pokes fun’ at a competitor?

In British Airways, Ryanair compared airfares and
cheekily called British Airways ‘EXPENSIVE BA . . . .DS!’.
British Airways alleged infringement of its registered ‘BA’
trade mark. Applying Laddie J’s liberal standards, Jacob J
held that the advertisement was commercially honest, as
the average consumer would not ﬁnd Ryanair’s price
comparison misleading.27 However, British Airways
invoked the MAD and argued that denigration was its
‘signiﬁcant extra’ provision—‘you can be offensive about

another’s trade mark or name without being dishonest’.28
Jacob J evaded this argument by holding that the MAD
could not supplant the TMA.29 Yet, in a subsequent case,
the judge declared that the CAD had turned section
10(6) into a ‘pointless provision’.30 The commercially
honest-but-denigrating argument thus seems valid after
all. Some believe that the new denigration provision
could also restrict pufﬁng, as ‘[e]ven the most unrealisti-
cally generous comparison—“X apples are great, but ours
are slightly more nutritious”—is a formula that unavoid-
ably casts the X brand in an unfavourable light’.31

Law in India
Sections 29(4) and 30 of India’s Trade Marks Act 1999
(‘ITMA’) together resemble section 10(6) of the TMA.
The ITMA replaced the Trade and Merchandise Marks
Act 1958 (‘TMMA’). The TMMA lacked a provision
similar to section 10(6) of the TMA. This lacuna came
to Coca Cola’s rescue when it was sued for derisively
using Pepsi’s globe-shaped visual mark in an advertise-
ment. The Delhi High Court held that the TMMA only
prohibited the use of trade marks if used to denote
false commercial origins.32

The ITMA belatedly came into force in September
2003. Comparative advertising disputes under
the
ITMA have been rare, but two recent cases are note-
worthy. In Paras v Ranbaxy,33 a commercial showed a
lady using an ineffective analgesic ointment. The lady
was then handed Ranbaxy’s ointment and told:
‘You
need a true pain reliever.’ The ﬁrst ointment’s pack-
aging resembled that of Paras’ MOOV ointment. Paras
alleged trade mark infringement. Citing Advanta and
British Airways, Ranbaxy adduced a pufﬁng defence
and pleaded commercial honesty. However, the Gujarat
High Court held that the advertisement was ‘dispara-
ging and denigrating’, MOOV, thus infringing Paras’
trade mark.34 In Procter & Gamble v Unilever,35 the
Calcutta High Court passed an interim injunction
order restraining Unilever from claiming that its Rin
detergent gave more ‘whiteness’ than Tide Naturals.
Unilever’s commercial had shown a shirt allegedly
washed with Tide Naturals remaining dull. Unilever

their advertisement was

contended that
laboratory tests showed that Rin did give more white-
ness. Thus, Unilever was apparently suggesting that
commercial honesty could invalidate allegations of deni-
gration. However, the Court took the view that rival
products could not be ‘proclaimed bad or rubbished’.36

These two precedents have intertwined denigration
and disparagement and set a high threshold for com-
mercial honesty, effectively bringing the ITMA closer to
the TMA (in its post-CAD avatar). Thus,
in both
Britain and India, the scope for comparative advertise-
ments has been greatly reduced. The TMA and the
ITMA only prohibit the tarnishment of registered trade
marks. At ﬁrst glance, this leaves the door ajar for an
advertisement
tarnishes a trader’s unregistered
mark. To illustrate, the cola wars in India often saw
mutual parodies. Coca Cola would make advertise-
ments
ridiculing ‘Pappi’, while Pepsi would mock
‘Grow Up’—a reference to Coca Cola’s Thums Up
cola.37 Each dummy product had a logo similar to that
of
the drink it was mocking. However, precedents
suggest that such advertisements would also constitute
registered trade mark infringement.

Protecting brand image
An unregistered mark can be an important component
of a product’s ‘brand image’ (ie the ‘cluster of attributes
and associations that consumers connect to the brand
name’,38 including packaging and presentation39). The
law of passing off protects elements of a brand image
that are not merely registered trade marks. This includes
the ‘get-up’ of a product.40 The ‘classical trinity’ of
requirements for a successful passing off action are ‘(1)
a reputation (or goodwill) acquired by the plaintiff in
his goods, name, mark, etc., (2) a misrepresentation by
the defendant
leading to confusion (or deception),
causing (3) damage to the plaintiff’.41 The ‘basic under-
lying principle’42 of a passing off action is that ‘A man is
not to sell his own goods under the pretence that they
are the goods of another man . . . ’.43 Passing off generally
occurs when a trader tries to appropriate a local rival’s
brand image—for example, by using deceptively similar

the defendants claimed that

packaging,44 word marks,45 or visual marks.46 In con-
trast, in comparative advertisements, traders invariably
dissociate themselves from the brand image of rival pro-
ducts. Thus, a passing off action is of no assistance in
the context of comparative advertisements. This is also
evident from the decision in L’Ore´al v Bellure.47 In
L’Ore´al,
their perfumes
smelt like more expensive counterparts made by L’Ore´al.
The defendants were thus using L’Ore´al’s word marks
but not pretending that their perfumes were L’Ore´al pro-
ducts. L’Ore´al contended that
the misrepresentation
requirement in a passing off action should be replaced
by a broader unfair-competition requirement. Jacob LJ
rejected this contention and held that
‘the tort of
passing off cannot and should not be extended into
some general law of unfair competition’.48

The Supreme Court of India has held that the classi-
cal-trinity test in passing off cases applies in India.49
Therefore, it is quite likely that the dictum in L’Ore´al
would be valid in India. However, in Paras, the ITMA
was liberally interpreted to prohibit the unlawful use of
marks deceptively similar to registered marks,
thus
compensating for the shortcomings of
the law of
passing off. Ranbaxy’s commercial had portrayed the
dummy ointment using a violet-and-white tube. Paras’
ointment had MOOV written in white on a violet
background. Ranbaxy contended that they were not
infringing Paras’ registered visual or word marks. But
the Court
that a ‘reasonable audience’ would
associate the dummy product with MOOV.50 The
Court observed that many consumers comprised illiter-
ate villagers who primarily identiﬁed products through
colour schemes. Thus, Ranbaxy would have to show a
dummy ointment that was in a differently coloured
tube.51

The decision in Paras was inﬂuenced by concerns
about socio-economic underdevelopment, but

diousness about brand imagery could see a similar
approach being
v
Hutchinson,52 Jacob LJ remarked that if the CAD only
protected trade marks exactly as registered, it would
lead to ‘absurd results’.53 The European Court of Justice

followed in Britain.

In O2

clariﬁed that if an advertisement uses a sign similar to
the mark of a competitor and this ‘is perceived by the
average consumer as a reference to that competitor or
to the goods and services which he offers’, then that
constitutes comparative advertising under the CAD.54
Hence, as per the Marleasing principle, section 10(6) of
the TMA would presumably apply in cases where a
mark confusingly similar to a registered trade mark is
used.

This shows that in both India and Britain the funda-
mental language of advertising has been recast. Deni-
gration of a rival product—whether identiﬁed by name
or through unregistered marks—appears to be nearly
impossible, even if commercially honest. Even puffery
risks being interpreted as denigration. Perhaps only
staid, factually precise comparisons are permissible. In
such circumstances, a possible option available to the
aggressive corporation is to broadly denigrate, even dis-
parage, all its competitors. For example, if Coca Cola
cannot say that Pepsi (or ‘Pappi’) tastes like ditchwater
and contains more fat, it can instead say that ‘other
colas’ have those qualities. If Unilever cannot say that
Tide is useless, it can at least disparage ‘ordinary deter-
gents’. Such non-speciﬁc advertising would, arguably,
evade the ambit of comparative advertising as deﬁned
in the MAD. In India, however, courts have held that
such advertisements can amount
to disparagement
under tort law.

The tort of disparagement
Salmond declared that every tort must ﬁt in a pre-
determined pigeonhole.55 Winﬁeld perceived this
theory as one that hindered the creation of new torts.56
The better view is that English courts have created new
torts only ‘by the gradual and sometimes almost imper-
ceptible extension of old torts’.57 Salmond’s theory

Indian judges have
occasionally created new torts through this method.

Rejecting English precedents on strict liability negli-
gence, Bhagwati CJ observed: ‘We have to evolve new
principles and lay down new norms . . . We cannot
allow our judicial thinking to be constricted by refer-
ence to the law as it prevails in England. . ..’60 The
judge thus justiﬁed his ‘venture to evolve a new prin-
ciple of liability which English courts have not done’.61
Like absolute liability negligence, generic disparagement
is a judge-made tort independently developed in India.
Indian judges who have developed this
tort have
refused to follow English precedents, emulating Bhag-
wati CJ’s approach in the Oleum Gas Leak case.

Generic disparagement has been derived from the
broader tort of disparagement. Like the tort of defama-
tion, the tort of disparagement concerns the protection
of reputation. But while the former tort seeks to
protect the reputation of a person the latter seeks to
protect the reputation of property and goodwill.62 Dis-

names’, such as trade libel and slander of goods,

writers’.64 The term ‘malicious falsehood’ has also been
used by various English judges. Although the Indian
judiciary has generally preferred the term ‘disparage-
ment’,
falsehood,
malicious falsehood, and disparagement are all syno-
nyms of each other,65 and I shall use these terms inter-

is that courts have shown great hesitation in inferring
malice, an essential
ingredient of the tort. In early
English cases, malice was understood to mean
‘without legal occasion, without any necessity’,67 or
‘without just cause or excuse’.68 In later cases, a more
stringent standard was imposed.69 Malice was linked
to a ‘sinister purpose’,70 or an ‘indirect or dishonest

cases, English courts
appear
to have adopted the latter conception of
malice and imposed a very high burden of proof
upon plaintiffs. In contrast, Indian judges have been
more indulgent towards plaintiffs.

English cases
Speciﬁc disparagement
A string of late nineteenth-century judgments speciﬁed
the conditions for liability in injurious falsehood cases.
In Ratcliffe v Evans, Bowen LJ held that ‘written or oral
falsehoods’ were actionable only if proof of malice,
along with actual damages, could be shown.72 These
conditions were reiterated in White v Mellin73 and
Hubbuck v Wilkinson.74 In White, Watson LJ afﬁrmed
that ‘[i]n order to constitute disparagement which is,
in the sense of law, injurious’, the disparagement had to
be ‘untrue’.75 Thus, Watson LJ was ostensibly providing
immunity to commercially honest, denigrating state-
ments. Watson LJ also suggested, along with Morris LJ,
that plaintiffs alleging tortious disparagement would
have to show proof of special damages.76 In Hubbuck,
the court condoned a leaﬂet, proclaiming the superior-
ity of the defendant’s product on the basis of nebulous
chemical tests, as lawful puffery. Lindley J held that
even if the statements were untrue and had caused loss
to the plaintiffs, there would be no cause of action.77
The judge stated: ‘[A]n allegation that the statement
was made maliciously is not enough to convert what is
prima facie a lawful into a prima unlawful statement. It
is not unlawful to say that one’s own goods are better
than other people’s.’78

The judicial reluctance to apply the tort has contin-
ued in modern times. In Emaco, Parker J held that the
defendants had breached the TMA’s tarnishment pro-
vision, but refused to uphold an additional claim for
injurious falsehood. The judge remarked: ‘It is plain on
the evidence that Dyson has in the past been guilty of
making exaggerated and misleading claims . . . . But . . .
that is not sufﬁcient to raise an inference of malice in

the publication of the graph.’79 In Cable & Wireless v BT,
Jacob J did not ﬁnd ‘a reasonable likelihood of signiﬁ-
cant numbers of people being misled’ by the price com-
parison which was the subject of the case.80 A trade
mark infringement claim thus failed. Jacob J commented
that a tortious disparagement claim did not add
anything to a trade mark infringement claim except the
‘burden (and costs) of proof of malice’.81 In British
Airways, Jacob J further tightened the conditions for
tortious disparagement by holding that ‘vulgar abuse’
could not amount to malicious falsehood.82

There is the odd judicial observation that offers some
faint hope for future claimants. In Lyne v Nicholls,83
Swinfen-Eady J held that the defendant’s ﬁb that his
newspaper had 20 times the circulation of the plaintiff ’s
was actionable. The case, however, failed as damages
could not be proved. In De Beers v General Electric,84 the
defendants claimed that their abrasive had ‘consistently
outperformed the plaintiffs’ and also required less
horsepower. The defendants relied on the ﬁndings of the
dubious-sounding ‘Application laboratory’.85 Walton
J held that the plaintiffs had reasonable cause of action.
The judge observed that while the statement ‘My goods
are better than X’s’ would not be actionable, the state-
ment ‘My goods are better than X’s, because X’s are
absolute rubbish’ would. Walton J relied on the obser-
vations of Shand LJ in White. Shand LJ had remarked
that ‘when all that is done is making a comparison . . .
and the statement made is that the plaintiff ’s goods are
inferior in quality or inferior . . . this cannot be regarded
as a disparagement of which the law will take cogni-
zance’. However, there would be a ‘good ground of
action’, not even requiring proof of special damages, in
cases of ‘intentional misrepresentation for the purpose
of misleading purchasers’, or a statement that a product
was ‘positively injurious, or that it contained deleterious
if it were used’.86
ingredients, and would be hurtful
Walton J ruled that the test to be applied was ‘whether a
reasonable man would take the [allegedly disparaging]
claim being made as being a serious claim or not’.87

In Compaq v Dell,88 Dell published advertisements dis-
couraging consumers from buying Compaq computers.
The advertisements claimed that Compaq’s prices were
‘thousands of pounds higher’ and that Compaq custo-

mers were left ‘at the mercy of the hardware dealer’, while
Dell gave ‘superior service and support’.89 Aldous J (as he
then was) granted an interlocutory injunction in favour
of Compaq. The judge held that the claims did not
appear to be justiﬁed and there were serious issues to be
tried with respect to injurious falsehood.90

Yet, in Lyne, De Beers, and Compaq, the respective
defendants were not conclusively held to have acted
maliciously. These cases cannot rebut the obvious con-
clusion that, in England, the tort of disparagement is
practically redundant.

Generic disparagement
There are few English precedents on the subject of
generic disparagement, White probably being the best-
known. In White, the defendant afﬁxed a label on the
plaintiff ’s rival product. The label stated that the defen-
dant’s baby food was ‘far more nutritious and healthful
than any other preparation yet offered’. The plaintiff
argued that the label was ‘manifestly disparaging’ and
‘calculated to injure the plaintiff ’s trade’. The plaintiffs
submitted that an injunction against such advertise-
ments could be granted if there existed a ‘reasonable
probability of damage, even without actual damage’.91
However, the House of Lords unanimously ruled in
favour of the defendants. Herschell LJ felt that, ﬁrst,
the label was an ‘anonymous puff ’ of a ‘very common
description’ which could not be said to have disparaged
the plaintiff ’s goods. Secondly, even if it was assumed
that
there was ‘an entire
absence of any evidence that the statement complained
of either had injured or was calculated to injure the
plaintiff ’.92 Thus, Herschell LJ did not say that a
generic disparagement claim could never succeed, but
pointed to the implausibility of proving the essential
ingredient of malice in such cases. Watson LJ similarly
observed that the label was merely ‘a highly coloured
laudation’ of
the defendant’s product. It made ‘no
reference to the plaintiff ’s goods beyond what might be
implied in the case of every other kind of food which is
recommended and sold as being suitable for consump-
tion by infant children’.93

disparagement claim. ASDA had stated that their pro-
ducts did not contain ‘hidden nasties’ like aspartame.
Ajinomoto claimed that ASDA was suggesting that
aspartame was unsafe, ‘impliedly making a statement
derogatory of products that do contain aspartame, and
so of aspartame itself ’.94 Ajinomoto argued that ASDA’s
‘implied derogatory statement’ was
false and that
ASDA knew it was false, thus making the statement
malicious.95 In the High Court, Tegendhat J afﬁrmed
that the tort of malicious falsehood had a ‘control
mechanism, namely the need to prove malice and,
either actual damage, or a statement calculated to cause
pecuniary damage’.96 The judge noted that numerous
questions would arise in relation to Ajinomoto’s
method of establishing malice, but did not rule out the
possibility of ASDA acting maliciously.97 In the Court
of Appeal, Rimer LJ observed, ‘If the case were allowed
to go to trial and the claimant were able to prove that
such meaning was false, uttered with malice and calcu-
lated to damage it, why should it not be entitled to
damages for the injury which the falsehood will have
caused it?’98 Thus, the High Court and the Court of
Appeal did not say that generic disparagement claims
were not actionable. However, considering the great
reluctance of English courts to infer malice in speciﬁc
disparagement cases, a generic disparagement claim
would appear to have minimal chance of success in
England.

Indian cases
Speciﬁc disparagement
In British India, the ratios of Ratcliffe, White, and
Hubbuck were followed by the Calcutta High Court in
Imperial Tobacco v Bonnan.99 The defendants were sued
for writing letters saying that the plaintiffs’ cigarettes
were inferior. The claim failed as the plaintiffs could
not prove malice. Rankin CJ rejected the contention
that ‘malice should be imputed to the defendant com-
pany’s servants for their efforts to persuade dealers that
their article was superior’.100 Ghose J afﬁrmed that an
action of disparagement lies only when a trader does
not merely say that a rival product is inferior, but ‘goes
further and makes an untrue statement of fact . . . for
example . . . that they are rotten or unmerchantable’.

Additionally, proof of malice and special damages were
necessary.101 Almost seven decades later,
in Reckitt
Colman v Ramachandran,102 the same court took a
different view and ‘set the trend in the direction that
the law has taken in India’.103

In Ramachandran, the defendants’ commercial com-
pared their blue (bleaching dye) with an unnamed
blue, described as expensive and ineffective. The rival
blue’s get-up matched that of Robin Blue, the plaintiffs’
product. As the ITMA did not exist then, the case
hinged on a tortious disparagement claim. The defend-
ants relied on Ratcliffe, White, and Hubbuck and sought
shelter under a pufﬁng defence.104 However, the plain-
tiffs cherry-picked Shand LJ’s and Walton J’s views in
White and De Beers respectively. The plaintiffs argued
that while pufﬁng was acceptable, rubbishing the goods
of a rival was not.105 The Court held that the defen-
dants had prima facie disparaged Robin Liquid Blue,
because of its similarities with the dummy product,
and granted the plaintiffs an interim injunction. Ghosh
J laid down ﬁve guiding principles in such cases.106
First, a trader could declare his or her goods as the
world’s best, even if this was untrue. Second, the goods
could be declared as being better than rival products,
even if untrue. Third, a comparison between the attri-
butes of rival goods was permissible. Fourth, a trader
could not describe rival products as bad—‘If he says so,
he really slanders the goods of his competitors’.107 Fifth,
if a trader slanders a rival product or a competitor, an
injunction can be granted to restrain such statements.

In Ghosh J’s ﬁve principles, the crucial point of
departure with English case law was the suggestion that
malice is implicit in a disparaging statement—Ajino-
moto’s position in their dispute with ASDA. In Rama-
chandran, the defendants, referring to Clerk & Lindsell
on Torts, had argued that a prerequisite of tortious dis-
paragement was ‘spite’ on the part of a defendant.108
While Ghosh J did not dispute this, he did not impose
any additional burden on plaintiffs to prove malice.
Ghosh J thus deviated from the English and British-
Indian position. The judge suggested that simply saying
that someone’s products are rubbish is enough to
attract liability. Also signiﬁcant was the non-imposition
of any actual-damages or special-damages criterion.

Soon after,

the Delhi High Court applied the
Ramachandran principles and restrained the use of a
commercial for Kiwi shoe polish.109 Kiwi’s commercial
had shown a dummy shoe-polish, marked ‘X’, dripping
with wax. The dummy product had a red blob on its
logo. The plaintiffs alleged disparagement of
their
Cherry brand shoe-polish. The Court was of the prima
facie opinion that the average consumer would get the
impression that the red blob was a reference to the
plaintiffs’ visual mark (a cherry). The Court ruled that
the commercial could be shown only if the red blob
was removed.110

paragement, alleging that Brand H was a reference to

show that the product of the rival is not suitable . . . it
would clearly fall within the realm of actionable
disparagement’.116

Generic disparagement
The genesis of
the tort of generic disparagement
in India can be traced back to Ramachandran. The
defendants had argued that they had not referred to
Robin Blue but to ‘the generic class of blues’, which
to do.117 Ghosh J,
they were ‘perfectly entitled’
however, remarked:

[I]t is difﬁcult to proceed on the basis that the defendant . . .
was not referring to Robin Blue, but assuming in the adver-
tisement insinuations are not made against Robin Blue and
the same were directed to all blues . . . can it be said that it
was not made against Robin Blue? The answer is a deﬁnite
‘no’, because Robin Blue is also a blue. . . .118

Ghosh J thus concluded that if a trader describes all of
his or her competitors as ‘bad’, then ‘anyone ﬁtting the
description of everyone is affected’.119

Some years later, Ghosh J’s observations were relied
upon by the plaintiffs in Dabur v Emami.120 Emami
manufactured Amritprash, an invented portmanteau
word whose latter half was derived from chayawanprash
(a traditional Indian herbal tonic). Emami’s commer-
‘Forget Chayawanprash . . . Eat
cial had the tagline:
Amritprash Instead’. Dabur, Emami’s main competitor,
alleged tortious disparagement. Emami argued that
chayawanprash was a common word and that their
commercial had not made the ‘slightest reference’ to
Dabur.121 The Delhi High Court, however,
stated:
‘[E]ven if there be no direct reference to the product of
the plaintiff and only a reference is made to the entire
class . . . in its generic sense . . . disparagement is poss-
ible . . . ’.122 The Court accordingly stayed the broadcast
of the commercial.

This decision opened the ﬂoodgates for generic dis-
paragement claims. A few months after the decision,
Dabur sued a competitor for boasting that its tooth-
powder was 16 times less abrasive than others. The
Delhi High Court granted an interim injunction in
Dabur’s favour. The Court conﬁrmed that generic dis-
paragement was indeed actionable.123 The Court ruled
that while pufﬁng was acceptable, ‘running down’ a rival

product, even in generic terms, was not.124 The defend-
ants cited English precedents and argued that generic
disparagement is not an offence. However, the Court
remarked: ‘The practice of undue obeisance to English
jurisprudence . . . should . . . be
discouraged. . . . When
there is a judgment [in India] . . . directly on the point
of generic disparagement, I see no reason why one
should travel westwards . . . ’.125

In Karamchand v Adhikari,126 the Delhi High Court
once again held that generic disparagement was action-
able. The Court stayed the broadcast of a commercial
which had shown the defendants’ mosquito repellent
giving better results than an anonymous rival product.
The Court observed:

A disparagement even if generic would remain a disparage-
ment and can be restrained at the instance of a party, who
manufactures or trades in that class of goods. . . . The
defendant is indeed entitled to boast that its product is . . .
the best but it cannot describe either the technology or the
concept used by any other manufacturer or trader . . . as
obsolete or worthless.127

In Eureka Forbes v Pentair,128 the defendant manufac-
tured a water puriﬁer which supposedly used a technol-
ogy different from that of traditional ultraviolet (UV)
water puriﬁers. Their advertisement claimed that water
contained contaminants that were ‘invisible even to the
UV water puriﬁer’. The Karnataka High Court held
that this statement had prima facie disparaged the
plaintiff ’s ‘Aquaguard’ UV water puriﬁer.129 The Court
held that merely because ‘there was no mention of the
word ‘“Aquaguard”’, it would ‘not take away the dis-
paraging effect of the advertisement’.130

In Colgate-Palmolive v Anchor,131 Anchor claimed to
be the ﬁrst ‘all round protection tooth paste’ and the
only toothpaste containing certain chemicals. The
Madras High Court held that the use of these adjectives
was factually incorrect but not disparaging. However,
Anchor would still have to remove them as their use
was prima facie an ‘unfair trade practice’. The Court
borrowed the deﬁnition of ‘unfair trade practice’ from
the Consumer Protection Act 1986 (‘CPA’).132 The CPA

‘unfair

to cover

trade practice’

statements
deﬁnes
which, inter alia, make false or misleading represen-
tations about goods.133 The CPA empowers specialized
tribunals to discontinue unfair trade practices.134 The
plaintiffs had not lodged a complaint under the CPA,
which only permits complaints from consumers, con-
sumer groups, or the state.135 The Court observed that
the CPA was enacted only as a supplementary law.
Thus, any consumer or manufacturer could still bring a
tortious action in a civil court against a trader for an
advertisement that amounted to an unfair trade prac-
tice.136 Hence, the Court essentially recognized a tort
of unfair competition, setting a precedent that is bound
to be the subject of discussion in future cases.

In contrast with the approach followed in the above
judgments, some Indian judges have shown a reluct-
ance to entertain generic disparagement claims.
In
Dabur v Wipro,137 Wipro compared its honey with an
insipid anonymous product. Lokur J of the Delhi High
Court asked Dabur, which alleged disparagement, ‘not
to be hyper-sensitive’.138 In Dabur v Colortek,139 Lokur
J similarly refused to ban a commercial where a mos-
quito-repelling cream had been compared with a
dummy product. Dabur had contended that the com-
mercial had impliedly referred to their product, as they
were market leaders in the segment. Lokur J felt that,
in the interests of protecting commercial speech, ‘an
advertiser must be given enough room to play around
in’ what he described as ‘the grey areas’ of disparage-
ment.140 The judge observed that market forces and
consumer choice ought to be ﬁnal adjudicators in such
matters, and once again asked Dabur not to be ‘hyper-
sensitive’.141 In both these cases, Lokur J did not
actually deny that generic disparagement was not
actionable. However,
that suggestion was seemingly
made in Hindustan Lever v Reckitt Benckiser.142 Here,
the makers of Dettol had compared their soap with a
dummy product and claimed that the former was 10
times more effective. Sikri J of the Delhi High Court
held that since the defendant’s commercial was ‘not dis-
paraging any product in particular’, it was ‘at best . . .

merely pufﬁng the defendant’s product Dettol, which is
permissible’.143 In light of the numerous cases that have
upheld generic disparagement claims, Sikri J’s obser-
vation appears to be an outlier.

Have Indian judges been overprotective?
In a seminal passing off case, Diplock LJ had observed
that since the nineteenth century, beginning with the
enactment of trade mark legislation, the British Parlia-
ment had intervened in the interests of consumers and
given ‘increasing recognition’ to ‘the need for more rig-
orous standards of commercial honesty’.144 Diplock LJ
thus remarked:

Where over a period of years there can be discerned a
steady trend in legislation which reﬂects the view of suc-
cessive Parliaments as to what the public interest demands
in a particular ﬁeld of law, development of the common
law in that part of the same ﬁeld which has been left to it
ought to proceed upon a parallel rather than a diverging
course.145

Today, the ‘steady trend’ that Diplock LJ spoke of has
intensiﬁed with the enactment of the CAD. English
judges have thus been criticized for their unwillingness to
infer malice in tortious disparagement claims, ‘lagging
legislation . . . in
badly behind the “steady trend” of
increased consumer protection’.146 On the
favour of
other hand, Indian courts have more readily accepted
tortious disparagement claims. In Anchor, the Court
even moulded the tort to match statutory consumer-
protection laws and suggested that a general tort of
unfair trading could exist. Signiﬁcantly, the Court also
ruled that
the Ramachandran principles were too
lenient towards traders. The Court pointed out that the
ﬁrst two of the Ramachandran principles—which allow
traders to falsely declare their products as the best or
better than rival products—were borrowed from nine-
teenth-century English law, but with the arrival of the
CAD, English law had ‘taken a swing from one extreme
to the other’.147 The Court opined that although India
lacked a codiﬁed advertising law, the country had wit-
nessed a similar regulatory trend through the CPA.148
Thus, untrue puffery ought not to be permitted.149 The
Court also justiﬁed its approach by saying that English
precedents should not apply in India, where literacy
rates were much lower.150

Since what English courts have termed ‘venial’
pufﬁng151 is permitted under the Ramachandran prin-
ciples, the decision in Anchor has brought about some
amount of confusion. Only the Supreme Court of
India can authoritatively declare whether,
in Anchor,
the High Court was right to swim against the judicial
tide. Yet, even if it is assumed that the position in
Anchor is incorrect, the more lenient previous verdicts
have still drawn a clear line between venial pufﬁng and
disparagement. As far as speciﬁc disparagement is con-
cerned, the Indian judiciary’s approach has some praise-
worthy aspects. By diluting the impenetrable malice
standard, Indian courts have been more pragmatic. If
plaintiffs can show tarnishment under statutory trade
mark law without proving malice, it makes little sense to
impose a high standard for proving malice in tortious
disparagement cases. Moreover, the Paris Convention
does not qualify the prohibition of disparagement by
imposing a malice criterion. English law appears to
impose a higher test.152 To this extent, the English
approach is unfeasible.

Alleging tortious disparagement in most registered
trade mark infringement cases would be superflu-
ous, especially since the ITMA has been inter-
preted to cover the tarnishment of deceptively

similar unregistered marks

Alleging tortious disparagement
in most registered
trade mark infringement cases would be superﬂuous,
especially since the ITMA has been interpreted to cover
the tarnishment of deceptively similar unregistered
marks. The tort could come in handy, however, if a
comparative advertisement disparages a speciﬁc trader
without using his or her trade mark. An example of
this would be a situation where an advertisement dis-
parages a rival company by mentioning its address or
displaying its shop-front.153 It is arguable that this is
also a form of speciﬁc disparagement which deserves to
be actionable in order to protect traders. However,
Indian courts have been over-protective by equating
commercially honest denigration with disparagement

and imposing an exacting standard of honesty for the
former. For example, the statement that Pepsi is sweeter
than Thums Up and is better-suited for children may
sound denigrating, but it is somewhat correct and,
therefore,
commercially honest. Such a statement
should not to be equated with disparagement. More-
over, a parody defence also ought to be allowed in tor-
tious disparagement and trade mark infringement cases,
if the use of a trade mark is non-confusing.154 As
Australia’s Attorney-General had argued while advocat-
ing a parody defence in copyright law, ‘taking the micky’
out of someone should not be an offence.155

Nevertheless, the greatest signiﬁcance of tortious
disparagement in India has been the fact it has been
extended to cover cases of generic disparagement.
In White, Herschell LJ had warned that
if courts
entertained generic disparagement claims,
‘a very
wide door . . . would be opened to litigation’, and
courts would ‘be constantly employed in trying the
relative merits of rival productions’.156 This is pre-
cisely what has happened in India, the most recent
illustration being a rather
trivial dispute between
Unilever and Procter & Gamble.157 In a country with
it is undesir-
a notoriously overburdened judiciary,
able to create a tort of such wide,
indeterminate
scope. Furthermore,
in some cases, even simple,
anonymous pufﬁng has been held to constitute
generic disparagement (for example,
the statement
Forget Chayawanprash . . . Eat Amritprash Instead’).
Such a pernickety
the
freedom of commercial speech. Although generic dis-
paragement disputes have generally been between
large corporations, a monopolistic corporation could
use the tort to hound smaller, poorer competitors
who merely boast that their products are the best.
Following Anchor, where the Court outlawed venial
pufﬁng and suggested that even a general
tort of
unfair trading can exist, vexatious corporate litigants
may end up having a ﬁeld day.

standard unduly quells

Also questionable is the paternalistic judicial assump-
tion that generic disparagement needs to be actionable
because consumers in economically underdeveloped
areas are more susceptible to such advertising. Studies
show that Indian villagers rely greatly on word-of-
mouth recommendations and do not easily change
brand loyalties.158 One survey has revealed that ,4 per
cent of rural consumers choose a soap based on adver-
tisements.159 This demonstrates that rural folk do not
really need any extra protection from venial pufﬁng
than their urban counterparts. It can even perhaps be
argued that individuals with limited amounts of money
at their disposal make more perspicacious consumers.

Hence, there are cogent reasons for not recognizing a
tort of generic disparagement, the leading one being the
fear of vexatious litigation from a vaguely-deﬁned tort.
If a trader does indulge in misleading puffery, an
aggrieved competitor can always seek the alternative
remedy of approaching the Advertising Standards
Council of India (ASCI). The ASCI is a voluntary,
self-regulatory body modelled on Britain’s Advertising
Standards Authority. The ASCI has framed an advertis-
ing code that prohibits statements which,
inter alia,
‘distort facts’ or ‘mislead consumers’.160 The ASCI’s
Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) hears complaints
against advertisements allegedly breaching the ASCI’s
advertising code. Because the CCC’s orders are not
legally binding, the ASCI was described, in Anchor, as
lacking ‘the necessary teeth’.161 However, this is too
harsh a view. A perusal of the CCC’s recent orders shows
that it restrained many cases of untrue puffery.162 For
example, a company which claimed to provide ‘the
fastest mobile broadband service in India’ was asked to
withdraw this claim, which it could not substantiate.163
Similarly, another company was asked to refrain from
saying that its lamps lasted three times longer than
other brands.164 The ASCI claims a compliance rate that
‘has hovered between 75 and 80 per cent’ and jumped to
94 per cent in 2008.165 Thus, the ASCI is a fairly effective

body and a suitable alternative forum for hearing
generic disparagement cases.

Lastly, since I advocate the abolition of generic dis-
paragement but the retention of speciﬁc disparagement,
a potentially problematic area could concern advertise-
ments that are ambiguous enough to fall into either
category. In such cases, courts could perhaps apply a
test which envisages how an average person would per-
ceive the alleged disparagement.

Constricting the pigeonhole
Indian courts have pragmatically dispensed with the
to separately prove malice in
need for plaintiffs

tortious disparagement cases by automatically inferring
malice. However, by expanding the pigeonhole of
disparagement to include generic disparagement, the
judiciary has been most impractical. Equating commer-
cially honest denigration with disparagement is objec-
tionable, as is the proscription of venial pufﬁng that
does not specify a particular competitor. A tortious
disparagement case is yet to be ﬁnally decided by the
Supreme Court of India, the ultimate interpreter of the
law in India. If and when this happens, it is hoped that
the Supreme Court will constrict the pigeonhole of
tortious disparagement in the manner suggested, viz
by prohibiting speciﬁc disparagement alone (excluding
commercially honest denigration).
