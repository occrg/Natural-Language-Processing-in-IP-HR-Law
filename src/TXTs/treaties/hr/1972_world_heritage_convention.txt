Convention concerning the Protection 
of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage

The  General  Conference  of  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientiﬁ c  and  Cultural  Organization 
meeting in Paris from 17 October to 21 November 1972, at its seventeenth session,

Noting that the cultural heritage and the natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruc-
tion not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions 
which aggravate the situation with even more formidable phenomena of damage or destruction,

Considering that deterioration or disappearance of any item of the cultural or natural heritage consti-
tutes a harmful impoverishment of the heritage of all the nations of the world,

Considering that protection of this heritage at the national level often remains incomplete because of 
the scale of the resources which it requires and of the insufﬁ cient economic, scientiﬁ c, and techno-
logical resources of the country where the property to be protected is situated,

Recalling  that  the  Constitution  of  the  Organization  provides  that  it  will  maintain,  increase,  and 
diffuse knowledge by assuring the conservation and protection of the world’s heritage, and recom-
mending to the nations concerned the necessary international conventions,

Considering that the existing international conventions, recommendations and resolutions concern-
ing cultural and natural property demonstrate the importance, for all the peoples of the world, of 
safeguarding this unique and irreplaceable property, to whatever people it may belong,

Considering that parts of the cultural or natural heritage are of outstanding interest and therefore 
need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole,

Considering that, in view of the magnitude and gravity of the new dangers threatening them, it is 
incumbent on the international community as a whole to participate in the protection of the cul-
tural  and  natural  heritage  of  outstanding  universal  value,  by  the  granting  of  collective  assistance 
which,  although  not  taking  the  place  of  action  by  the  State  concerned,  will  serve  as  an  efﬁ cient 
complement thereto,

Considering that it is essential for this purpose to adopt new provisions in the form of a convention 
establishing an effective system of collective protection of the cultural and natural heritage of out-
standing universal value, organized on a permanent basis and in accordance with modern scientiﬁ c 
methods,

Having decided, at its sixteenth session, that this question should be made the subject of an interna-
tional convention,

Adopts this sixteenth day of November 1972 this Convention.

heritage mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 is situated, and without prejudice to property right pro-
vided by national legislation, the States Parties to this Convention recognize that such heritage 
constitutes a world heritage for whose protection it is the duty of the international community 
as a whole to co-operate.

2.  The States Parties undertake, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, to give their 
help in the identiﬁ cation, protection, conservation and presentation of the cultural and natural 
heritage referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11 if the States on whose territory it is situ-
ated so request.

3.  Each State Party to this Convention undertakes not to take any deliberate measures which might

III.   Intergovernmental Committee for the protection 

of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage

Article 8

1.  An Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the Cultural and Natural Heritage of 
Outstanding  Universal  Value,  called  “the  World  Heritage  Committee”,  is  hereby  established 
within the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and Cultural Organization. It shall be com-
posed of 15 States Parties to the Convention, elected by States Parties to the Convention meet-
ing in general assembly during the ordinary session of the General Conference of the United 
Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and Cultural Organization. The number of States members of 
the Committee shall be increased to 21 as from the date of the ordinary session of the General 
Conference following the entry into force of this Convention for at least 40 States.

2.   Election of members of the Committee shall ensure an equitable representation of the different 

regions and cultures of the world.

3.  A representative of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of 
Cultural Property (Rome Centre), a representative of the International Council of Monuments 
and Sites (ICOMOS) and a representative of the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
and Natural Resources (IUCN), to whom may be added, at the request of States Parties to the 
Convention  meeting  in  general  assembly  during  the  ordinary  sessions  of  the  General  Confer-
ence of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and Cultural Organization, representatives 
of other intergovernmental or non-governmental organizations, with similar objectives, may 
attend the meetings of the Committee in an advisory capacity.

Article 9

1.  The term of ofﬁ ce of States members of the World Heritage Committee shall extend from the 
end of the ordinary session of the General Conference during which they are elected until the 
end of its third subsequent ordinary session.

2.  The term of ofﬁ ce of one-third of the members designated at the time of the ﬁ rst election shall, 
however, cease at the end of the ﬁ rst ordinary session of the General Conference following that 
at which they were elected; and the term of ofﬁ ce of a further third of the members designated 
at the same time shall cease at the end of the second ordinary session of the General Conference

Basic Texts of the 1972 World Heritage Convention

12

by the President of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and 
Cultural Organization after the ﬁ rst election.

3. 

States members of the Committee shall choose as their representatives persons qualiﬁ ed in the 
ﬁ eld of the cultural or natural heritage.

Article 10

1.  The World Heritage Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.

2.  The Committee may at any time invite public or private organizations or individuals to partici-

pate in its meetings for consultation on particular problems.

of its functions.

Article 11

1.  Every State Party to this Convention shall, in so far as possible, submit to the World Heritage 
Committee an inventory of property forming part of the cultural and natural heritage, situated 
in its territory and suitable for inclusion in the list provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article. 
This inventory, which shall not be considered exhaustive, shall include documentation about 
the location of the property in question and its signiﬁ cance.

2.  On the basis of the inventories submitted by States in accordance with paragraph 1, the Com-
mittee shall establish, keep up to date and publish, under the title of “World Heritage List,” a list 
of properties forming part of the cultural heritage and natural heritage, as deﬁ ned in Articles 1 
and 2 of this Convention, which it considers as having outstanding universal value in terms of 
such criteria as it shall have established. An updated list shall be distributed at least every two 
years.

3.  The inclusion of a property in the World Heritage List requires the consent of the State con-
cerned.  The  inclusion  of  a  property  situated  in  a  territory,  sovereignty  or  jurisdiction  over 
which is claimed by more than one State shall in no way prejudice the rights of the parties to 
the dispute.

4.  The Committee shall establish, keep up to date and publish, whenever circumstances shall so 
require, under the title of “list of World Heritage in Danger”, a list of the property appearing 
in the World Heritage List for the conservation of which major operations are necessary and 
for which assistance has been requested under this Convention. This list shall contain an esti-
mate of the cost of such operations. The list may include only such property forming part of 
the cultural and natural heritage as is threatened by serious and speciﬁ c dangers, such as the 
threat of disappearance caused by accelerated deterioration, large-scale public or private projects 
or  rapid  urban  or  tourist  development  projects;  destruction  caused  by  changes  in  the  use  or 
ownership of the land; major alterations due to unknown causes; abandonment for any reason 
whatsoever; the outbreak or the threat of an armed conﬂ ict; calamities and cataclysms; serious 
ﬁ res, earthquakes, landslides; volcanic eruptions; changes in water level, ﬂ oods and tidal waves. 

Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage

13

The  Committee may at any time, in case of urgent need, make a new entry in the List of World 
 Heritage in Danger and publicize such entry immediately.

5.  The Committee shall deﬁ ne the criteria on the basis of which a property belonging to the cul-
tural or natural heritage may be included in either of the lists mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 4 
of this article.

6.  Before refusing a request for inclusion in one of the two lists mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 4 of 
this article, the Committee shall consult the State Party in whose territory the cultural or natural 
property in question is situated.

7.  The Committee shall, with the agreement of the States concerned, co-ordinate and encourage 
the studies and research needed for the drawing up of the lists referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 
of this article.

Article 12

The fact that a property belonging to the cultural or natural heritage has not been included in either 
of the two lists mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11 shall in no way be construed to mean 
that it does not have an outstanding universal value for purposes other than those resulting from 
inclusion in these lists.

Article 13

1.  The World Heritage Committee shall receive and study requests for international assistance for-
mulated by States Parties to this Convention with respect to property forming part of the cultural 
or natural heritage, situated in their territories, and included or potentially suitable for inclu-
sion in the lists mentioned referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11. The purpose of such 
requests may be to secure the protection, conservation, presentation or rehabilitation of such 
property.

2.  Requests for international assistance under paragraph 1 of this article may also be concerned 
with identiﬁ cation of cultural or natural property deﬁ ned in Articles 1 and 2, when preliminary 
investigations have shown that further inquiries would be justiﬁ ed.

3.  The Committee shall decide on the action to be taken with regard to these requests, determine 
where appropriate, the nature and extent of its assistance, and authorize the conclusion, on its 
behalf, of the necessary arrangements with the government concerned.

4.  The Committee shall determine an order of priorities for its operations. It shall in so doing bear 
in mind the respective importance for the world cultural and natural heritage of the property 
requiring protection, the need to give international assistance to the property most representa-
tive of a natural environment or of the genius and the history of the peoples of the world, the 
urgency of the work to be done, the resources available to the States on whose territory the 
threatened property is situated and in particular the extent to which they are able to safeguard 
such property by their own means.

tions, the amount of which, in the form of a uniform percentage applicable to all States, shall 
be determined by the General Assembly of States Parties to the Convention, meeting during the 
sessions of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and Cultural 
Organization. This decision of the General Assembly requires the majority of the States Parties 
present  and  voting,  which  have  not  made  the  declaration  referred  to  in  paragraph  2  of  this 
Article. In no case shall the compulsory contribution of States Parties to the Convention exceed 
1% of the contribution to the regular budget of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and

the time of the deposit of its instrument of ratiﬁ cation, acceptance or accession, that it shall not 
be bound by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article.

3.  A State Party to the Convention which has made the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 of this 
Article may at any time withdraw the said declaration by notifying the Director-General of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁ c and Cultural Organization. However, the withdrawal of 
the declaration shall not take effect in regard to the compulsory contribution due by the State 
until the date of the subsequent General Assembly of States parties to the Convention.

4. 

In order that the Committee may be able to plan its operations effectively, the contributions 
of States Parties to this Convention which have made the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 
of this Article, shall be paid on a regular basis, at least every two years, and should not be less

than the contributions which they should have paid if they had been bound by the provisions 
of paragraph 1 of this Article.

5.  Any State Party to the Convention which is in arrears with the payment of its compulsory or vol-
untary contribution for the current year and the calendar year immediately preceding it shall 
not be eligible as a Member of the World Heritage Committee, although this provision shall not
