CONVENTION FOR THE SAFEGUARDING 

OF THE INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE 

The  General  Conference  of  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural 
Organization  hereinafter  referred  to  as  UNESCO,  meeting  in  Paris,  from  29  September  to 
17 October 2003, at its 32nd session, 

Referring  to  existing  international  human  rights  instruments,  in  particular  to  the  Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights of 1948, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights of 1966, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, 

Considering  the  importance  of  the  intangible  cultural  heritage  as  a  mainspring  of  cultural 
diversity  and  a  guarantee  of  sustainable  development,  as  underscored  in  the  UNESCO 
Recommendation  on  the  Safeguarding  of  Traditional  Culture  and  Folklore  of  1989,  in  the 
UNESCO  Universal  Declaration  on  Cultural  Diversity  of  2001,  and  in  the  Istanbul 
Declaration of 2002 adopted by the Third Round Table of Ministers of Culture, 

Considering the deep-seated interdependence between the intangible cultural heritage and the 
tangible cultural and natural heritage, 

Recognizing  that  the  processes  of  globalization  and  social  transformation,  alongside  the 
conditions they create for renewed dialogue among communities, also give rise, as does the 
phenomenon of intolerance, to grave threats of deterioration, disappearance and destruction of 
the  intangible  cultural  heritage,  in  particular  owing  to  a  lack  of  resources  for  safeguarding 
such heritage, 

Being  aware  of  the  universal  will  and  the  common  concern  to  safeguard  the  intangible 
cultural heritage of humanity, 

Recognizing  that  communities,  in  particular  indigenous  communities,  groups  and,  in  some 
cases, individuals, play an important role in the production, safeguarding, maintenance and re-
creation of the intangible cultural heritage, thus helping to enrich cultural diversity and human 
creativity, 

Noting  the  far-reaching  impact  of  the  activities  of  UNESCO  in  establishing  normative 
instruments  for  the  protection  of  the  cultural  heritage,  in  particular  the  Convention  for  the 
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of 1972, 

Noting further that no binding multilateral instrument as yet exists for the safeguarding of the 
intangible cultural heritage, 

Considering  that  existing  international  agreements,  recommendations  and  resolutions 
concerning the cultural and natural heritage need to be effectively enriched and supplemented 
by means of new provisions relating to the intangible cultural heritage, 

Considering the need to build greater awareness, especially among the younger generations, 
of the importance of the intangible cultural heritage and of its safeguarding, 

Considering  that  the  international  community  should  contribute,  together  with  the  States 
Parties to this Convention, to the safeguarding of such heritage in a spirit of cooperation and 
mutual assistance, 

- 2 - 

  
Recalling UNESCO’s programmes relating to the intangible cultural heritage, in particular the 
Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, 

Considering  the  invaluable  role  of  the  intangible  cultural  heritage  as  a  factor  in  bringing 
human beings closer together and ensuring exchange and understanding among them, 

Adopts this Convention on this seventeenth day of October 2003.

Article 2 – Definitions 

For the purposes of this Convention, 

1. 
The  “intangible  cultural  heritage”  means  the  practices,  representations,  expressions, 
knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated 
therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their 
cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, 
is  constantly  recreated  by  communities  and  groups  in  response  to  their  environment,  their 
interaction  with  nature  and  their  history,  and  provides  them  with  a  sense  of  identity  and 
continuity,  thus  promoting  respect  for  cultural  diversity  and  human  creativity.  For  the 
purposes  of  this  Convention,  consideration  will  be  given  solely  to  such  intangible  cultural 
heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with 
the  requirements  of  mutual  respect  among  communities,  groups  and  individuals,  and  of 
sustainable development. 

The “intangible cultural heritage”, as defined in paragraph 1 above, is manifested inter 

2. 
alia in the following domains: 

(a)  oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible 

cultural heritage; 

(b)  performing arts; 

(c) 

social practices, rituals and festive events; 

(d)  knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; 

(e) 

traditional craftsmanship. 

- 3 - 

  
“Safeguarding”  means  measures  aimed  at  ensuring  the  viability  of  the  intangible 
3. 
cultural  heritage, 
identification,  documentation,  research,  preservation, 
protection,  promotion,  enhancement,  transmission,  particularly  through  formal  and  non-
formal education, as well as the revitalization of the various aspects of such heritage. 

including 

the 

“States  Parties”  means  States  which  are  bound  by  this  Convention  and  among  which

Article. To that extent the expression “States Parties” also refers to such territories.

altering  the  status  or  diminishing  the  level  of  protection  under  the  1972 
Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage 
of  World  Heritage  properties  with  which  an  item  of  the  intangible  cultural 
heritage is directly associated; or
