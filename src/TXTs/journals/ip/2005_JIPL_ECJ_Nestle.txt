and Franzoni) [2003] I.R.D.I. 282.

An important difference between the two cases,
however,
is that in this case the defendants were
domiciled in non-EC member states, Brazil and
South Korea. The court held that since patent law was
not a subject matter excluded from the Brussels-I
Regulation, the domicile of the defendants was irrele-
vant for the purpose of considering jurisdiction under
Article 31 of the regulation (see also Case C-391/95
Van Uden Maritime v Kommanditgesellschaft in Firma
Deco-Line [1998] Eur Court Rep I-7091). Therefore,
referring to its earlier ruling in the Medtronic v Therex
case of 23 June 2000 ([2002] Intellectuele rechten
Droit Intellectuel 328), the court held that the domi-
cile of the defendants in a non-EC member state did
not prevent Article 31 from applying since this was
an autonomous ground of jurisdiction which existed
independently of Article 4(1) of the regulation.

Practical significance

This case can be seen as good news for patent holders.
It shows that Belgian courts, which were—often
unfairly—renowned for their alleged tardiness in
dealing with patent cases and were sometimes reluc-
tant to get into the technical complexity of (bio-)
pharmaceuticals and medical devices, seem more

Although the outcome of each case will of course
depend on its facts, and although other courts may
prefer a different approach (see P. de Jong,
‘The
Belgian Torpedo: From Self-Propelled Armament to
Jaded Sandwich’ [2005] Eur Intellectual Property Rev
75), this ruling could have a positive impact on patent
litigation in summary proceedings. It is, in particular,
likely to make it easier for patentees to take legal
action against companies who believe that
their
non-European status will deter patent holders from
enforcing their patent rights, in particular at interna-
tional fairs. Article 31 of the Brussels-I Regulation or,
alternatively, the relevant provisions of the new Bel-
gian Code on Private International Law seem to be

useful tools in keeping such companies in check in
Europe.

Trade Marks

& ECJ allows service marks for
retail trade and tells Nestle´ it can
‘HAVE A BREAK’ without having
a Kit Kat
Socie´te´ des produits Nestle´ SA v Mars UK Ltd
(Case C-353/03)

In response to a reference from the UK Court of
Appeal, under trade mark Directive 89/104/EEC of
21 December 1988, the ECJ determined that dis-
tinctive character may be acquired through use as
part of an already registered trade mark.

Legal context

The ECJ was asked to rule on a reference made by the
English Court in relation to the application for regis-
tration by Nestle´ of the words ‘HAVE A BREAK’. The
questions referred related to interpretation of First
Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988
(the ‘Directive’).

Under Article 2 of the Directive,

a trade mark may consist of any sign capable of being
represented graphically, particularly words, including
personal names, designs, letters, numerals, the shape
of goods or of their packaging, provided that such
signs are capable of distinguishing the goods of one
undertaking from those of other undertakings.

Article 3 of the Directive deals with grounds for
refusal to register/invalidity of a trade mark. Specific-
ally, Article 3(1)(b) provides that trade marks which
are ‘devoid of any distinctive character’ shall either
not be registered or shall be liable to be declared
invalid, and Article 3(3) provides that ‘a trade mark
shall not be refused registration or be declared invalid

in accordance with paragraph 1(b) . . . if, before the
date of application for registration and following
the use which has been made of it, it has acquired a
distinctive character.’

Facts

The name KIT KAT and the slogan ‘HAVE A
BREAK . . . HAVE A KIT KAT’ are existing trade
marks owned by Nestle´. In March 1995, Nestle´ also
applied to register the words ‘HAVE A BREAK’ as a
trade mark in their own right.

The application was opposed by Mars UK Ltd, on
the grounds that the words ‘HAVE A BREAK’ were
not
‘distinctive’ under Article 3(1)(b). The trade
mark registry and High Court (on appeal from the
registry) agreed with Mars and refused registration of
the mark. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the Court
agreed that on the evidence, the mark itself was devoid
of any distinctive character and was precluded from
registration under Article
3(1)(b). The Court
held that registration may therefore only occur on
the basis of Article 3(3) of the Directive, subject to
proof of distinctive character acquired through use.

The mark had thus far been rejected on the basis that
the phrase ‘HAVE A BREAK’ was not used genuinely
as an independent trade mark but was essentially
used only as part of the registered trade mark ‘HAVE
A BREAK . . . HAVE A KIT KAT’, such that the words
‘HAVE A BREAK’ alone had not acquired distinctive-
ness
this was
wrong and that rejecting marks on this basis could
have serious consequences for registration of shapes
as marks, as such marks are seldom used by them-
selves. It further argued that a slogan-like phrase used
in association with a trade mark could over time
acquire distinctiveness through repetition and use.

through use. Nestle´ argued that

On the basis of Nestle´’s submissions on this
point the Court of Appeal stayed the proceedings
and the ECJ was asked to make a preliminary ruling
on the question: ‘may the distinctive character of a
mark referred to in Article 3(3) of [the Directive]
and Article 7(3) of [the regulation] be acquired
following or in consequence of the use of that mark
as part of or in conjunction with another mark?’

Analysis

The ECJ decision The ECJ handed down its decision
on 7 July 2005. The ECJ considered the previous case

in particular,
law on acquired distinctiveness and,
what was meant by the following words in the judg-
ment in Case C-299/99 Philips [2002] Eur Court
Rep I-5475: ‘in regard to acquisition of distinctive
character through use, the identification, by the rele-
vant class of persons, of the product or service as
originating from a given undertaking must be as a
result of use of the mark as a trade mark’.

the mark. Therefore,

It held that the expression ‘use of the mark as a
trade mark’ did not necessarily mean that the mark
must have been used independently and,
in fact,
that Article 3(3) contained no such restriction on
use—Article 3(3) refers to ‘use which has been made’
of
the mark as a
trade mark’ must be understood as referring solely
to use for identification by the relevant class of con-
sumers. Acquisition of distinctive character could
therefore be as a result ‘both of use, as part of a reg-
istered mark, of a component thereof and of the use
of a separate mark in conjunction with a registered
trade mark’.

‘use of

What is relevant, therefore, in both use as a com-
ponent of and use in conjunction with a separate
mark, is whether the relevant class of persons actually
perceive the product (or service), as designated by the
mark, as originating from a given undertaking. In
assessing this, the Court must continue to have regard
to the well-established ‘global assessment’ test, as
described in the ECJ’s judgment
in Windsurfing
Chiemsee [1999] Eur Court Rep I-2779.

Practical significance

It will be for the UK Court now to decide whether, in
fact, the words ‘HAVE A BREAK’ alone have acquired
distinctiveness by their use in the slogan ‘HAVE A
BREAK . . . HAVE A KIT KAT’ (we would expect
the evidence to support this). This ruling represents
a further development in the law of trade marks
from registration of shapes and slogans to registra-
tions of shapes which are not used independently
and parts of
these are
proven to be distinctive in their own right. In prac-
tice, it is unlikely that this will result in a flood of
new applications, but it will extend the monopoly
for retailers who have succeeded in creating suitably
distinctive merchandising for their goods, and clearly
the ECJ, at least, recognizes the sector’s investment in
such.

Praktiker Bau und Heimwerkerma¨rkte AG v Deutsches
Patent- und Markenamt (Case C-418/02)

In response to a question from the German Courts,
the ECJ also determined that trade marks could be
registered for ‘services provided in connection
with the retail trade’.

Legal context

On the same day as the Nestle´ v Mars ruling, the ECJ
ruled on two questions referred to it by the German
Federal Patents Court also on the interpretation of
the Directive. The questions were:

(i) Does the Community Directive on trade marks
allow protection of service trade marks in the
retail trade?

(ii) What details are required for registration?

Facts

Praktiker, a German DIY store, had filed for registra-
tion of the trade mark PRAKTIKER for the service of
‘retail trade in building, home improvement, garden-
ing and other consumer goods for the do-it-yourself
sector’. The German Patent and Trade Mark office
(Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt) rejected the
application, taking the view that the concept of ‘retail
trade’ did not denote independent services having
autonomous economic significance: retail trade related
only to the distribution of goods as such, and there-
fore trade marks could be registered only in respect
of the goods distributed in each case.

Praktiker appealed to the Federal Patents Court
(Bundespatentgericht), claiming inter alia that ‘the
economic trend towards a service society necessitated
a re-appraisal of retail trade as a service’. The Federal
Patents Court stayed the proceedings and referred the
above questions to the ECJ.

it

falls to the Court

Analysis
The ECJ Decision The ECJ confirmed that
in
the absence of a definition of ‘services’ in the Direc-
tive,
to supply a uniform
interpretation. It noted that the objective of retail
trade is the sale of goods to consumers and that this
trade includes, in addition to selling per se, all activity
carried out by the trader for the purpose of encourag-
ing consumers to buy. Therefore, it ruled that a ser-
vice mark may be registered for services provided in

connection with the retail trade; that it is not neces-
sary to specify in detail the service(s) in question,
but that the applicant must specify details of the goods
or types of goods to which those services relate. The
reasoning behind this is to make it easier to identify
prior registrations and determine the exclusive right
conferred on the proprietor, without appreciably lim-
iting the protection afforded to the trade mark.

Practical significance

The Praktiker decision on services in connection with
the retail trade is not surprising (to an English eye at
least), confirmatory, as it is, of the position already
adopted by the English courts.

HOME DEPOT, Higher Regional Court (Oberlandes-
gericht) Hamburg, Decision 5 U 36/04 of 27 January
2005

A recent decision of the Higher Regional Court of
Hamburg in Germany provides useful guidance as
to which law applies when trade mark infringe-
ments are committed in several EU member states;
the Court found an effective and workable solution
that enhances Community Trade Mark Regulation
enforcement and strengthens its unitary character
throughout the Community.

Legal context

Since
the Community Trade Mark Regulation
(CTMR) came into force in 1996, we have seen little
on litigation procedure in national courts. The
CTMR’s overwhelming importance, proven by the
volume of applications and the vast number of deci-
sions given by the Office for Harmonization in the
Internal Market (OHIM), the Court of First Instance,
and the European Court of Justice, has not been
reflected at the level of enforcement. So few CTMR
