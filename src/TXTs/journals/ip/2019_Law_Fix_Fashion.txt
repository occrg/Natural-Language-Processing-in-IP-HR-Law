Can the law fix the problems of fashion? An
empirical study on social norms and power
imbalance in the fashion industry
Guido Noto La Diega*

1. Scope of the study and research
methods

It does not seem controversial that intellectual property
law is not Ô¨Åt for the fashion industry.1 From this consid-
eration, the call on lawmakers to amend existing laws2 or
current jurisprudential approaches3 usually follows in or-
der to ensure creativity be rewarded. Conversely, some ar-
gue that there is no need for reforms, because fashion is
regulated by social norms,4 and the industry ‚ÄòbeneÔ¨Åts
from widespread copying‚Äô.5 There is a resurgence of stud-
ies showing how innovation thrives without the need for
legal monopolies.6 Researchers,7 however, recently have
shown how the regulation of creativity by social norms is
not necessarily only a positive fact. In the same vein, this
author has been carrying out empirical qualitative re-
search to map social norms and how these are interwoven
with power imbalance throughout the fashion‚Äôs supply
chain. If the law, including intellectual property law, is
not a primary concern for industry players, potential
reforms risk being useless, if not accompanied by broader
interventions that address said imbalance. Fashion is a re-
minder that economic rewards are not the only incentive
to creativity. However, one should not take for granted
that alternative incentives be better than IP rights. A low-
IP equilibrium can be negative if some stakeholders can
leverage their power to get away with unfair practices, like
certain big brands‚Äô tendency to copy clothing designs
from young designers and small apparel companies.8

 The fashion industry is affected by an imbalance of power that

goes beyond the outsourcing of part of the manufacture to devel-
oping countries. Said imbalance characterizes the whole supply
chain and hinders freedom of expression, freedom to conduct
business and, hence, creativity and innovation. In order to under-
stand fashion, IP lawyers and lawmakers need to take into account
that the law is not the main device for regulating the relevant rela-
tionships. Indeed, fashion is a closed community, a family where
complaining is rather frowned upon and where contracts do not
reÔ¨Çect the actual relationships between the parties.

 In order to rebalance power, this article explores the possibility of

treating good faith and inequality of bargaining power as unifying
principles of contract law. However, in light of the evidence col-
lected during a number of in-depth interviews with fashion stake-
holders, it seems clear that social norms are the main source of
regulation of relationships and, therefore, intervening at the level
of the contracts may not be helpful. Competition law, in turn,
may be of more help in rebalancing power; however, cases such as
Coty v Parfu¬®merie Akzente do not augur well. Moreover, competi-
tion law is useful when the relationship is over, but it is in all the
stakeholders‚Äô interest to keep the relationship alive while Ô¨Åxing its
imbalance. This study conÔ¨Årms recent Ô¨Åndings that social norms
do not just have a positive impact on Ô¨Åelds with low IP-equilib-
rium and sheds light on the broader consequences of the reliance
on social norms and on its relationship to power imbalance.

 This work makes a twofold recommendation. First, IP lawyers should

engage more with the unfamiliar Ô¨Åeld of social norms. Second, advo-
cates of a reform of IP aimed at transforming the industry into an IP-
intensive one should be mindful that the effort may prove useless, in
light of the role of social norms, especially if power is not distributed.

hindering creativity. Rebalancing the fashion supply chain
could, therefore, ensure fairer relationships, as well as
more diverse and creative expressions.

In an editorial on this Journal, Neil Wilkof9 invited
IP lawyers to better identify and understand systems
based on social norms, suggesting that they do not lie
outside the scope of IP practice. This work intends to
take up this challenge, because IP law may not be Ô¨Åt for
fashion, but IP lawyers must be.

In terms of research methods, alongside a European
Union (EU)- and UK-based legal analysis, this author in-
depth interviewed eighteen fashion stakeholders, eight of
which working on the creative side of fashion,10 10 on
the legal one.11 Snowball sampling was followed to reÔ¨Çect
the quasi-sectary features of the fashion industry.12 The
difÔ¨Åculty in Ô¨Ånding fashion creatives willing to be inter-
viewed may be regarded as a conÔ¨Årmation of such depic-
tion of the fashion community as a closed world, as a
family, if not a sect. Unlike quantitative research, qualita-
tive methods do not aim to be representative of the entire
relevant population, nor present results that could be
universally generalized.13 Therefore, despite the relatively
low number of interviews, the Ô¨Åndings are worth of pre-
sentation because clear threads have emerged during the
collection and analysis of the data. Future research should
attempt to broaden the sample including representatives
of all the professional categories involved in the industry.

power inequalities, most of them made the assumption
that the focus would have been on the outsourcing of
the manufacture to factories in developing

standard of protection of

than in Europe.14 The unwillingness to talk about such
sensitive issues may have contributed to some potential

In 2017, Oxfam denounced how powerful brands are
responsible for the poverty of workers in countries like
Bangladesh, where only 2 per cent of the price paid for
an item of clothing goes towards factory wages.15 The is-
sue is worsened by tax avoidance practices that do not
make possible a redistribution of wealth.16 The problem
is closely related to the lack of transparency in the supply
chain; most of the biggest global fashion and apparel
brands and retailers do not disclose sufÔ¨Åcient (if at all)
information about their suppliers, their practices, and
socio-environmental impact.17 While the sustainability is
increasingly on many companies‚Äô radar,18 the commit-
ment is still overall low and not growing fast enough.19
The blockchain could be an important tool to achieve an
ethical fashion by making the supply transparent, and
distributing power,20 but its adoption will depend on
the attainment of legal certainty. This said, the sustain-
ability movement is no panacea, being ‚Äòyet another band
of privileged white women essentially focused on Ô¨Årst
world problems‚Äô.21 This may be put in relation with the
fact, analysed below, that the prevalence of social norms
can lead to the exclusion of intersectional problems,
approaches, and methodologies.

Even though human rights are a primary concern,
this research moved from the belief that power inequal-
ity was a much more pervasive phenomenon in the

fashion industry22 and, therefore, aimed at mapping it
throughout the supply chain. The examples are count-
less. Just to name a few, Ô¨Årst, a study found that there is
an imbalance of power between Western original brand
manufacturers‚Äô buyers and Chinese original equipment
manufacturers‚Äô
recent
trends seem to suggest that the balance of power is
shifting in favour of Asian companies.24 Moving along
the supply chain, said imbalance can have devastating
consequences when it leads to sexual harassment, as un-
covered in November 2017 by some British models
with regards to the abuses perpetrated by photogra-
phers.25 Edie Campbell,
in particular, denounced a
huge power imbalance that is at the basis of an ‚Äòunspo-
ken contract‚Äô26 according to which models give up
ownership of their body. This may be read in the con-
text of the more general problem of ‚Äògender power im-
balance throughout the industry‚Äô.27 However, it cannot
be reduced to a gender issue. For example, male model
Cory Bond,
in talking about him being sexually
assaulted and drugged, pointed out that he never spoke
out because the assailants were powerful and he did not
want to lose his job.28 In 2018, similar episodes were
reported29 and the public outrage that followed led to
Vogue terminating the accused photographers‚Äô con-
tracts30 and Conde¬¥ Nast adopting a code of conduct to
prevent power abuses.31 More recently, some have de-
nounced the dominance of so-called inÔ¨Çuencers, al-
though brands are expected to ‚Äòright
the power
imbalance‚Äô32 in growing inÔ¨Çuencer marketing industry.
Some positive changes must be acknowledged. The

power imbalance between designers and models allowed
the imposition of very unhealthy lifestyle, but LVMH33
and Kering34 joining forces to end the use of ‚Äòsize zero‚Äô
models is a step forward,35 even though much still
needs to be done to re-balance the relevant relationship.
Sometimes, competition law has been used to address
power imbalance. For example, a number of modelling
agencies were Ô¨Åned for colluding on prices thus harm-
ing high-street chains, online fashion retailers and con-
sumer goods brands.36 However,
this route is not
always viable, as shown by the Court of Justice in Coty
v Parfu¬®merie Akzente,37 where a luxury brand was
allowed to impose restrictive distribution agreements
excluding third-party ecommerce platforms.

3. Can ‚Äòinequality of bargaining power‚Äô
and good faith as general principles
address the imbalance of power in the
fashion industry?

Traditional contract law is based on the assumption
that transactions occur between parties that are on the
same level in terms of power. One of the theoretical
merits of EU consumer law has been to reverse the as-
sumption and build a legal sub-system that is protective
of vulnerable parties, whose weakness depends primar-
ily on information asymmetries.38 Imbalance of power
is addressed by consumer protection laws that render a
number of contractual clauses unenforceable and by
giving judges the power to change the content of

business-to-consumer (B2C) contracts. However, fash-
ion inequalities characterize more often business-to-
business (B2B) relationships, rather than B2C ones.
Therefore, it is crucial to assess if there are corrective
mechanisms in place and if they are sufÔ¨Åcient.

This work‚Äôs initial thesis was that an answer to the
problem could have been considering the imbalance of
bargaining power and good faith as unifying principles
in contract law, hence overcoming the rigidities of the
established categories of vitiation, and ultimately reba-
lancing power throughout the fashion supply chain.

Lord Denning MR, in Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy39 sug-
gested that there is in English law a general principle of
inequality of bargaining power, by which agreements are
voidable if resulting from said inequality. In particular:

English law gives relief to one who, without independent ad-
vice, enters into a contract upon terms which are very unfair
(. . .) when his bargaining power is grievously impaired by
reason of his own needs or desires, or by his ignorance or in-
Ô¨Årmity, coupled with undue inÔ¨Çuences or pressures brought
to bear on him by or for the beneÔ¨Åt of the other.40

The existence of the principle has not been accepted by
most scholars41 and subsequent case law.42 However,
recently it has been suggested that a ‚Äòunifying principle
is discernible, but that it should be formulated alterna-
tively as ‚Äúexploitation of constrained autonomy‚Äù‚Äô.43 As
convincing as this interpretive proposal is, the prevail-
ing idea44 would still appear to be that a contract can
be voided at common law or in equity only for duress,
undue inÔ¨Çuence, and unconscionable bargains. To said
categories of vitiation, one has to add to this the statu-
tory restrictions to freedom of contract introduced by
Parliament to protect certain categories, such as con-
sumers,45 employees46 and tenants.47

The argument could be put forward that the doc-
trines of duress, undue inÔ¨Çuence, and unconscionable
bargains could be uniÔ¨Åed under the principle of in-
equality of bargaining power, since principles at com-
mon law can be developed building on policies

expressed by statutory regimes.48 As per Sir Thomas
Bingham in Timeload Ltd v British Telecommunications
plc,49 the common law could use protective statutes
also beyond their scope ‚Äòas a platform for invalidating
or restricting the operation of an oppressive clause‚Äô.50
The initial hope of this study was to provide evidence
that the phenomenon of inequality of bargaining power
is becoming a structural element of contemporary
transactions. New protective policies to address the
inequalities in the fashion industry might have contrib-
uted to the acceptance of the inequality of bargaining
power as a unifying principle.

Another route that this author envisaged as a way to
rebalance the relationships throughout the fashion sup-
ply chain was good faith. Leggatt J in Yam Seng Pte Ltd
v International Trade Corp Ltd51 innovatively argued
that a general term of good faith may be implied under
certain conditions. This concept is still far from being
accepted,52 but courts seem increasingly inclined to im-
ply good faith terms, especially in relational and long-
term contracts,53 which raised the hopes of many as to
its potential as a general organizing principle.54 This
study aimed to explain several doctrines as expressions
of the duty of good faith (eg duress and inequality of
bargaining power), which in turn could have rectiÔ¨Åed
some of the inequalities in the fashion industry. Thus,
in a cross-fertilization process, good faith could have
been an argument for the recognition of the unifying
principle of inequality and, in turn, the latter could
have been a piece of the good-faith puzzle. Whilst there
is certainly potential for the development of these lines
of thought, they do not seem useful to resolve the prob-
lems of fashion.

and good faith rose as general principles, they could Ô¨Åx

the problems of fashion only if the relationship between
the players of the industry were regulated by law and,
in particular, contract law. The interviews conducted
for this research suggest that this is not the case. In fact,
they indicate that either there is a fair contract between
the parts, but this is never applied, or the contract is
unfair, but no one dares complaining about it because
of the imbalance of power. This happens also because
fashion is a closed community, a ‚Äòfamily‚Äô, based on per-
sonal contacts and courteous exchanges, where enforc-
ing the law, especially against the big luxury brands, is
socially unacceptable. In the same vein, copyright law
scholars suggest that certain communities are regulated
by social norms, rather than traditional
laws. This
would be the case not only for the world of fashion,55
but also for that of chefs,56 stand-up comedians,57 and
all the professions occupying the ‚Äònegative space‚Äô58 of
IP, eg tattoo artistry,59 magic60 and sports.61 Social
norms are not the only explanation of the phenome-
non; this is sometimes due (also) to the following fac-
tors or a combination thereof: market
incentives,
psychological
factors, Ô¨Årst-mover advantages, path-
dependency, and happenstance.62 Social norms often
prevail on the enforcement of copyright, even when
there is no doubt that copyright laws apply: grafÔ¨Åti is a
very clear example of this.63 Another interesting Ô¨Åeld of
research on copyright and social norms, then, unveiled

how authors, publishers, and translators in Israel were
slow in the reception of colonial copyright and ‚Äòdevel-
oped an alternative set of norms, adding to an overall
scheme of private ordering. It included literary norms,
contractual norms, business, and industry practices‚Äô.64
While the reception of copyright law led to a decline of
social norms,65 this does not seem to be the case with
fashion, where social norms thrive even in a context of
increasing IP protection, such as the European one.

In fashion, the role of social norms would explain
the famous ‚Äòpiracy paradox‚Äô whereby imitation sparks
innovation and infringement is good for creativity,66 to
the point that IP protection may be counterproductive,
because it would inhibit more innovation than it pro-
motes.67 It must be said, nonetheless, that while there is
a growing body of evidence that proves that infringe-
ment can beneÔ¨Åt all the stakeholders involved,68 more
data is needed to ascertain the harm of IP protection. It
seems clear, however, that even when not harmful, IP
has been long unnecessary in Ô¨Åelds such as fashion.
Raustiala and Springman explain that creativity and in-
novation beneÔ¨Åt from copying because of the key role
played by social and economic status (fashion items are
‚Äòpositional‚Äô)69
cyclical.70
These characteristics of fashion would not be possible if
the behaviour of the relevant community were not reg-
ulated by social norms treating copying as ordinary

and because

behaviour, which is neither punished nor encouraged.71
Since the choice of buying a fashion item depends on
what others buy, it can be said that ‚Äòthe value of a posi-
tional good arises in part from social context‚Äô.72 A re-
lated important social rule is the so-called ‚Äòinduced
obsolescence‚Äô, ie the need for the fashion industry to
make things go out-of-date rapidly. It is crucial that an
increasing number of people wear a certain item, for it
to lose the status of trendy. The weak IP protection of
fashion facilitates this process; indeed, if ‚Äòcopying were
illegal, the fashion cycle would occur very slowly‚Äô.73
Copying seems a socially acceptable norm in its own
right. Indeed, even if copying may harm some design-
ers, they are not ‚Äòstrongly incentivized to break free of
the low-IP equilibrium because, often, they are also
copyists‚Äô.74 Copying is also important in the so-called
anchoring,
ie the process of establishing trends and
communicating them effectively ‚Äòthrough an undirected
process of copying, referencing, receiving input from
consultants, testing design themes via observation of
rivals‚Äô designs at runway shows, communication with
buyers for key retailers, and coverage and commentary
in the press‚Äô.75 A strong IP protection of fashion may
hinder anchoring.

The qualitative research carried out conÔ¨Årms that
the fashion community is profoundly regulated by so-
cial norms, but argues that this can have very negative
effects, especially when the imbalance of power is signif-
icant and widespread. This idea is broadly related to re-
cent work76 that for the Ô¨Årst time77 challenged the
assumption that the prominent role of social norms in
certain creative communities is by deÔ¨Ånition a positive
phenomenon. Whereas social norms may in some con-
texts resolve the free-riding problem, they could none-
theless hinder innovation in other ways, especially if
over-enforced. First, there are the ‚Äòresearch priority‚Äô
norms. They can be problematic when strongly
enforced within a community ‚Äòso that members‚Äîand
in particular marginal members‚Äîare discouraged from
focusing on intersectional problems‚Äô.78 Secondly, when
a community identiÔ¨Åes itself by endorsing a single
nonconforming
methodology,

77 Critiques to single aspects of this stream of copyright literature on social
norms were already present. For instance, JA Schachter, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs My Joke
. . . Art . . . Trick! How the Internal Norms of IP Communities are
Ineffective Against Extra-community Misappropriation‚Äô (2012) 12(1)

methodologies are excluded, and since ‚Äòintersectional
problems are often best addressed by a combination of
methodologies, the kinds of exclusion described above
can have important negative social consequences‚Äô.79
Exclusion of methodologies equals exclusion of people
and of their visions. For instance, mainstream abstract
expressionists‚Äô methodologies
silenced young artists
and particularly those who ‚Äòresisted what they saw as
Abstract Expressionists‚Äô narcissistic tendencies and
overfocus on art as a therapeutic tool‚Äô.80 Thirdly, the
way a community evaluates the worth of the work of
their members can constitute an anti-innovation norm.
When over-enforced, said evaluation norms maintain
‚Äòresearch priority and methodological blinders that pre-
vent boundary-crossing innovations‚Äô.81 For instance,
important research on the impact of chemotherapeutic
drugs on fertility was impeded by its not falling pre-
cisely under the remit of just one funding institution.82
Whilst the above considerations appear accurate, so-
cial norms can be harmful not only when over-enforced
and not only from an innovation perspective. They can
be when they regulate communities in which power im-
balance is substantial and pervasive; this is the case of
fashion.

The interviews conducted for this study evidenced
the imbalance of power throughout the fashion supply
chain. The Ô¨Åndings presented here regard in particular
the power exercised by the top luxury brands on buyers
and retailers. Leveraging the imbalance, said brands im-
pose non-negotiable contracts that do not reÔ¨Çect the ac-
tual relationship with buyers and retailers. This means
inter alia that although between the parties there is of-
ten a long-term relationship, the contracts are designed
as if a new agreement were to be agreed every season,
thus not allowing buyers and retailers are never sure if
they can count on the luxury items‚Äô provision or not.
Let us imagine, for instance, that Valentino last minute
decreases the quantities that can be ordered and/or the
mark-ups (how much a seller ‚Äòmarks up‚Äô a product
from its previous cost). Apart from a direct impact on
the revenues, there is an uncertainty that makes plan-
ning impossible. Sometimes the contractual provisions

provide any solution to the violations coming from outside the relevant
community.

reÔ¨Çect the reality of the relationship, that is, a ‚ÄòsigniÔ¨Å-
cant imbalance in the parties‚Äô rights and obligations
arising under the contract‚Äô,83 which would be unen-
forceable if it referred to a B2C relationship, whereas
there is no redress in a B2B context.84

The weak contractual party does not call into ques-
tion the contracts, manage to negotiate them, nor
enforces breaches because if they disagree with the top
brands, they feel that they will be excluded by the latter
the following season and they risk the interruption of
any commercial relationship. Hence, the law‚Äîand con-
tractual law in particular‚Äîis not the device that practi-
cally regulates the relationships in the fashion supply
chain. Interviewees conÔ¨Årm that what matters is the
factual relationship, which is very tight and is related to
a situation of economic dependence because if a retailer
is no longer allowed to sell, say, Gucci items, this could
have permanent consequences on the sustainability of
the retailer‚Äôs business model.

It seems related to the imbalance of power also the
regulation of third-party ecommerce, which is con-
trolled one-sidedly by luxury brands. There may be a
rational justiÔ¨Åcation for restricting the resale on online
retail platforms such as Amazon for image and reputa-
tion reasons or at least this was the position taken by
the Court of Justice in Coty.85 This ruling is problem-
atic for a number of reasons, including the undue re-
striction of the principle of exhaustion,86 but this is
beyond the scope of this article. The unilateral regula-
tion of third-party ecommerce goes beyond this. For in-
stance, many luxury brands do not allow their
authorized retailers to put in place keyword advertising.
If a retailer is authorized to sell ‚ÄòofÔ¨Çine‚Äô it means that it
meets the image requirements imposed by the luxury
brand and, arguably, that there has been exhaustion.
Therefore, there is no rational
justiÔ¨Åcation for said
restriction.87

5. Conclusion

In light of the collected evidence, this researcher‚Äôs initial
thesis of Ô¨Åxing the power imbalance of the fashion in-
dustry using inequality of bargaining power and good
faith as unifying principles does not seem tenable. One
cannot resolve said imbalance using contract law, since
contracts do not reÔ¨Çect the actual relationship between
the parties and when they do, their unfairness is not
acted upon because in the fashion community it would
be socially unacceptable to go against those who hold
the power. Nonetheless, the development of said unify-
ing principles may be viable and prove fertile in other
sectors.

Competition law may be of some assistance, but the
trend in the recent European case law does not augur
well. Interviewees conÔ¨Årmed that competition law is
sometimes of help after the relationship is over, but it is
in everybody‚Äôs interest to Ô¨Ånd tools to keep the rela-
tionship alive, while Ô¨Åxing its imbalance.

This study aimed at contributing to the exploration
‚Äòdark side‚Äô.88 The fashion
of ‚Äòsocial norms‚Äô potential
community represents itself as a family where Ô¨Åghts are
rather frowned upon. In said community, law and con-
tracts are not the devices actually regulating the rela-
tionships throughout
the supply chain. A twofold
recommendation follows. First, IP lawyers should en-
gage more with the unfamiliar Ô¨Åeld of social norms.
Since the over-enforcement of social norms prevents
the full understanding of intersectional issues, only a
genuinely multidisciplinary methodology can put pro-
fessionals in a good position to grasp the intricacies a
fashion. Second, advocates of a reform of IP aimed at
transforming the industry in an IP-intensive one should
be mindful that the effort may prove useless, in light of
the role of social norms, especially if power is not dis-
tributed or, at least, rebalanced.

83 Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in con-

87

sumer contracts, OJ L 95/29, art 3(1).

84 Much depends on the jurisdiction. In Italy, for instance, there is a tool at

the crossroads of competition law and contracts, the so-called abuse of
economic dependence that may address power imbalance in B2B rela-
tionships. Legge 18 June 1998, No 192 Disciplina della subfornitura nelle
attivita` produttive, art 9. See V Falce, ‚ÄòVendite On E Off Line Dei
Prodotti Di Lusso: Nuovi Rilievi Concorrenziali‚Äô (2013) 4 Dir ind 377.
See n 38.

85
86 The preliminary ruling regarded only competition law matters, ie the

TFEU, art 101(1), and the Commission Regulation (EU) No 330/2010 of
20 April 2010 on the application of art 101(3) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the EU to categories of vertical agreements and concerted
practices, OJ L 102/1, art 4. However, arguably Coty (n 38) does not
comply with the principle of exhaustion, which applies to all intellectual
property rights.

First, under InterÔ¨Çora Inc v Marks & Spencer Plc [2014] EWCA Civ 1403
[99], keyword advertising is not inherently objectionable. In the analysed
scenario, said practice seems lawful under the Trade Marks Act 1994, s
10(6) (use of a registered trade mark by for the purpose of identifying
goods or services as those of the proprietor), s 11(2)(b) (use of indica-
tions about characteristics of goods or services), s 11(2)(c) (necessity to
indicate the intended purpose of a product or service), and s 12 (exhaus-
tion). The judgment in Portakabin Ltd and Portakabin BV v Primakabin
BV, C-558/08, EU:C:2010:416, preventing third-party keyword advertis-
ing, does not apply here because consumers do not assume that luxury
items originate from multi-brand retailers. Moreover, an argument a con-
trario can be construed to apply Aktiebolaget Volvo v Heritage (Leicester)
Ltd [2000] F.S.R. 253: the Volvo‚Äôs dealer could have availed themselves
of a defence under s 11(2)(c) if they were still an authorized seller.
