The W***D C*P of 2*1*: FIFA’s intellectual
property rights in South Africa
Roshana Kelbrick*

Setting the stage
South Africa won the bid to host the 2010 FIFA World
Cup, an event that is, according to the local website,
‘arguably the greatest show on the planet’.1 FIFA (the
Fe´de´ration Internationale de Football Association) is
the governing body of world soccer and thus controls
the soccer world cup. To be successful in its bid, the
government had to furnish various guarantees, includ-
ing a guarantee that it

also acknowledges FIFA’s intellectual property rights. It will
also provide FIFA with the support of relevant local auth-
orities to help protect its marketing and broadcast rights.2

Numerous legislative provisions have already been pro-
mulgated that will protect FIFA’s various interests in
South Africa. Two Acts dealing only with the 2010
FIFA World Cup have been promulgated: the 2010
FIFA World Cup South Africa Special Measures Act 11
of 2006 and the Second 2010 FIFA World Cup South
Africa Special Measures Act 12 of 2006. This legislation
facilitates the practical implementation of allowing a
large number of persons access to the country for a
speciﬁc purpose: it waives some immigration require-
ments; permits the playing of all national anthems and
display of ﬂags; facilitates visas and work permits for
FIFA’s delegates, personnel and commercial afﬁliates;
suspends restrictions regarding marketing, distribution,
and consumption of liquor for the duration of the
event;
for and
health care providers to the teams; introduces access
control measures at stadiums and creates a number of
safety regulations.

restrictions on medicines

suspends

Two areas of interest for purposes of this discussion
can be identiﬁed: legislative protection of FIFA’s own
IP and protection against use by third parties of their
own IP in respect of the FIFA event.

I will deal with the second aspect ﬁrst as I do not
intend to discuss it in any detail. Section 15A of the
is
Merchandise Marks Act,

introduced in 2002,

Key issues
† Section 15 of the South African Merchandise
Marks Act 17 of 1941 gives the trade marks of
designated international organizations protection
that may far exceed what is available in terms of
trade-mark legislation.
† This article sets out the various statutes that
protect FIFA’s marks in South Africa and con-
siders whether these marks are entitled to such
extended protection

intended to prevent ambush marketing, ie attempts by
non-sponsor organizations and individuals to use a
major public event for publicity purposes, usually by
implying some form of association with the event. This
does not ﬁnd favour with ofﬁcial sponsors, who have
paid for actual association. Once an event is designated
as protected event, section 15A(2) provides that

for the period during which an event is protected, no
person may use a trade mark in relation to such event in a
manner which is calculated to achieve publicity for that
trade mark and thereby to derive special promotional
beneﬁt from the event, without the prior authority of the
organiser of such event.

Section 15A was introduced when South Africa hoped
to host the 2008 Olympic Games, but has now been
put to use in respect of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This
event was designated a protected event in terms of
section 15A on 25 May 2006 and protection runs from
that date until 6 months after the event.3 So FIFA is
effectively protected against ambush marketing for a
period of 4 years before the event and 6 months after
it ends.

The ﬁrst aspect, protection of FIFA’s own intellectual
property,
this note. The South
African government guaranteed that FIFA’s intellectual
property would be acknowledged. But how far does

‘acknowledgement’ go? Extremely far, at least in FIFA’s
opinion. The FIFA website gives its interpretation of
the extent of protection in terms of South African legis-
lation. It states, when dealing with speciﬁc statutory
rights in South Africa, that ‘FIFA is the owner of all
rights in relation to the 2010 FIFA World CupTM,
which includes all media, marketing, licensing and tick-
eting rights. Just like any other entity with registered
and unregistered trademarks, the Ofﬁcial Marks are
protected in South Africa by law, such as the Trade
Marks Act, the Copyright Act, the Counterfeit Goods
Act,
the common law tort of passing off and the
Advertising Standards Authority’s Code of Advertising
Practice.4 Ofﬁcial marks are described in the same
document as ‘an assortment of
logos, words, titles,
symbols and other trademarks’ and include terms such
as WORLD CUP and 2010 SOUTH AFRICA in
addition to terms that would more usually be recog-
nized as some form of IP. The FIFA website also pro-
vides details of
speciﬁc South African statutory
provisions which protect FIFA’s

section 9(d) of the Trade Practices Act 76 of 1976 and
section 15 of the Merchandise Marks Act 17 of 1941.5

Legislation protecting FIFA’s IP
Trade Marks Act 194 of 1993
FIFA is the proprietor of, or applicant for, over 500
trade marks in South Africa. Starting in 1993, it has
registered or applied for word marks in most goods
and service classes for terms such as FIFA World Cup,
World Cup, South Africa 2010, and World Cup 2010. It
has also registered or applied for numerous device
marks which include common words and numerals
such as South Africa 2009, and 2010. Given this
blanket trade mark cover, it seems surprising that FIFA
feels it necessary to require any additional legislation to
protect its IP rights. Why is this so?

A trade mark is registered in a speciﬁc class for par-
ticular goods or services. An application or registration
can be attacked on various grounds: some absolute,
pertaining to the mark itself, and others relative, that is
when the mark is viewed in relation to marks of
others. Some of the most common grounds for attack
contained in section 10 of the Trade Marks Act 194 of

7 This section provided that, if a trade mark ‘contains matter common to
the trade or otherwise of a non-distinctive nature’, the registrar or court

1993 are those that deal with inherent distinctiveness
and those that deal with good faith use.

Section 10(2) prohibits registration of a mark which

is not capable of distinguishing within the meaning

(a)
of section 9; or
(b)
consists exclusively of a sign or an indication which
may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity,
intended purpose, value, geographical origin or other
characteristics of the goods or services, or the mode or
time of production of the goods or of rendering of the
services;
(c)
consists exclusively of a sign or an indication which
has become customary in the current language or in the
bona ﬁde and established practices of the trade.

Section 10(4) prohibits registration of a mark

in relation to which the applicant for registration has no
bona ﬁde intention of using it as a trade mark, either
himself or through any person permitted or to be permitted
by him to use the mark as contemplated by section 38.

for

applications

Either provision may be used to attack FIFA’s existing
registrations or
registration. The
decision in Federation Internationale de Football and
others v Bartlett and others6 is instructive in respect of
both possibilities. The respondent was
the South
African proprietor of the trade mark WORLD CUP,
registered in 1969 under the Trade Marks Act 62 of
1963. The mark consisted of the words World Cup and
a representation of a globe, being registered in two
classes (sports clothing and sports equipment). FIFA
sued Bartlett for passing off and unlawful competition
because Bartlett, on the basis of his two registrations,
was leading people to believe that he held the South
African licensing rights for the 1994 FIFA World Cup
in America. At that stage, FIFA had no statutory pro-
tection for any form of IP in South Africa.

FIFA also attacked the validity of the two Bartlett
registrations, alleging that the words ‘world cup’ were
common to the trade in terms of section 18 of the
Trade Marks Act 62 of 1963.7 The court agreed that
these words were common to the trade, in particular in
respect of sports clothing8 and also descriptive of one
or more sporting events, such as the soccer world cup,
the rugby world cup, and the cricket world cup. The
words were therefore also non-distinctive in respect of

may require a disclaimer to be entered in respect of such matter. The
equivalent provision in the current Act is s 15, which provides that a
disclaimer may be required in respect of ‘matter which is not capable of
distinguishing within the meaning of section 9’.

sports clothing and sports equipment.9 In the circum-
stances, the court found that the words ‘world cup’
were ‘simply of a non-distinctive character in South
Africa’10 and ordered the respondent’s trade marks to
be amended by the entry of the following disclaimer
‘Registration of this trade mark shall give no right to
the exclusive use of the words “world cup” separately
and apart from the mark’.11

How then has FIFA obtained a number of word
marks consisting of this term simpliciter or containing
the words ‘world cup’, and what is the extent of their
protection? All the word trade marks held by FIFA that
comprise or contain the words ‘world cup’ are regis-
tered subject to the following endorsement:

Registration of this trade mark shall give no right to the
exclusive use of the words WORLD CUP except in relation
to goods/services clearly connected with [‘and intended to
be connected with’ is included in more recent marks] the
FIFA Football World Championship being the football
competition held every four years under FIFA’s authority.

What is the effect of this disclaimer? In general, if a dis-
claimer is registered, it is not for the totality of the
mark. For example, a disclaimer would cover the separ-
ate words in a word mark consisting of two or more
words, or the words in ordinary, but not fancy, type-
script (this is the type of disclaimer registered in
respect of the Bartlett trade marks). Here, the full mark
appears to be effectively disclaimed:
is
registered and the phrase ‘world cup’ is disclaimed. But
one interpretation of this disclaimer is that the full
mark is disclaimed except for use in respect of FIFA’s
event. In other words, it is no disclaimer whatsoever.
So although FIFA, during litigation, stated that the
phrase ‘world cup’ is non-distinctive and common to
the trade, when someone else is using it, FIFA effec-
tively maintains a monopoly on these words in respect
of its own world cup.

‘World Cup’

The effect of the disclaimer entered in respect of the
word mark SOUTH AFRICA 2010 is even more inter-
esting. This is the usual form of disclaimer:

Registration of this mark shall give no right to the exclu-
sive use of the words SOUTH AFRICA or of the numerals
2010 separately and apart from the mark.

The mark is registered or advertised in 37 of the poss-
ible 45 classes. So, in effect, no-one except FIFA may
use the words South Africa and the numerals 2010
together in respect of nearly all goods or services.

the great common of

Obviously, this only relates to use ‘as a trade mark’,12
but it is reminiscent of Sir Herbert Cozens-Hardy’s
statement that ‘wealthy traders are habitually eager to
the English
enclose part of
language and to exclude the general public of
the
present day and of the future from access to the enclo-
sure’.13 So how will South African wine producers
describe their 2010 vintages on labels, given the FIFA
registration in class 33 for alcoholic beverages? And,
since Emirates is the sponsor airline, how will South
African Airways describe its ﬂights that year?

It is futile to canvass the meaning and effect of these
endorsements further. These phrases are likely to be
tested in court in the near future, along with other
arguments on distinctiveness. But there are also other
problems with the FIFA registrations.

FIFA intends to use few of these trade marks. Again,
reference to FIFA v Bartlett is illuminating. The judg-
ment contains a lengthy exposition14 of the various
licensing and sponsorship arrangements in place for
‘FIFA World Cup USA 94’. At the time of this decision,
the 1963 Act was still in force. This required identiﬁ-
cation of licensees when applying for a trade mark.15
Identiﬁcation is no longer necessary, but section 10(4)
of the current Act requires intention to use as a trade
mark by the applicant or a ‘permitted user’.

The question then arises: is this actual
commercial use to promote the products in
respect of which the trade marks are registered,
or merely promotional use to promote the
FIFA World Cup?

Two possible issues arise here. First,

is FIFA’s
intended use of all
its registrations and applications
bona ﬁde? The facts set out in FIFA v Bartlett, and
other statements by FIFA (inter alia on its website),
clarify that FIFA intends to use only a tiny percentage
of the marks itself or through its associated companies.
The bulk of registrations are to be licensed out for use
by licensees or sponsors. The question then arises: is
this actual commercial use to promote the products in
respect of which the trade marks are registered, or
merely promotional use to promote the FIFA World
Cup? If the latter, the comments by Cameron JA in

Arjo Wiggins Ltd v Idem Ltd and another16 may be
appropriate:

Bartlett family, will be used to challenge any of the
FIFA marks is anyone’s guess.

. . . use of the trade mark on the promotional products did
not constitute bona ﬁde use as contemplated by the statute
. . . to constitute bona ﬁde use the proprietor had to use
the trade mark upon goods with the object or intention of
protecting, facilitating or furthering trade in those goods.

JA raised a second related issue in South
Harms
African Football Association v Stanton Woodrush (Pty)
Ltd t/a Stan Smidt and Sons and another.17 Here
SAFA intended to use the trade mark Bafana Bafana,
the nickname of the national soccer team, for merchan-
dizing and licensing purposes. But did SAFA enjoy
goodwill in the team name such that the public would
assume
connection existed between
clothing bearing this name and the team? As Harms
JA queried:
the name “Bafana
Bafana” used on clothing, does it denote a chink in
the distant cash register of SAFA and no more?’18
Harms JA did not answer this question directly but, in
a footnote to his query, referred to FIFA v Bartlett,
adding:

‘[w]hen one sees

that a trade

[t]he fact that business people are prepared to pay for so-
called merchandising rights does not provide an answer to
the question [that is, whether the public would assume a
trade connection], which has to be answered with refer-
ence to the public’s perception.19

Sir Robin Jacob, considering whether the Olympic
symbol is a trade mark, stated that

Real trade marks denote a commercial association between
the goods or services bearing the mark and the owner. The
only association between the Olympic symbol and any
goods or services bearing the mark is that permission has
been given by the IOC.20

In conclusion, FIFA’s trade mark rights in South Africa
are not as secure as it appears. I think these marks are
open to attack, on grounds which include those I have
indicated above. Also, FIFA still does not hold the
crucial two registrations that were the subject of FIFA v
Bartlett: trade marks for WORLD CUP in the two most
important classes of clothing (class 25) and games and
sporting equipment (class 28). Whether these two
registrations, still

Trade Practices Act 76 of 1976
Section 9(d) of the Trade Practices Act, inserted in the
main Act in 2001, provides that no person

shall, in connection with a sponsored event, make, publish
or display any false or misleading statement, communi-
cation or advertisement which represents,
implies or
suggests a contractual or other connection or association
between that person and the event, or the person sponsor-
ing the event, or cause such statement, communication or
advertisement to be made, published or displayed.

FIFA’s website states that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is
designated as a sponsored event. FIFA maintains that

any entities (companies, non-commercial organisations or
persons) which do not have explicit prior written per-
mission from FIFA, may not use words or images in their
advertising, marketing and point of sale displays which
imply an association with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

According to FIFA, words or images protected by this
Act
include any ‘ofﬁcial marks’. These include the
numeral 2010 and the words Twenty Ten used with
words such as soccer, World Cup, or South Africa, and
the words World Cup used with words such as soccer
or South Africa.21

The memorandum on the objects of the Trade Prac-
tices Amendment Bill, 2001, which inserted section
9(d) into the main Act, states that it seeks to ‘prohibit
certain practices known as “ambush marketing” in
respect of sponsored events’. It adds:

[t]he Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act No. 51 of 1977),
the Merchandise Marks Act, 1941 (Act No. 17 of 1941)
[this Act was amended to give such protection in 2002],
the Counterfeit Goods Act, 1997 (Act No. 37 of 1997), the
Trade Marks Act, 1994 (Act No. 194 of 1993) and the
common law do not offer any assistance. When the afore-
mentioned Acts were enacted the concept of ‘ambush mar-
keting’ did not exist and the offences created in those Acts
were not intended to cater for this type of practice. The
courts do not view ‘ambush marketing’ as a crime(sic)
under the common law principle of passing-off, and as a
result there has been no criminal sanction against this type
of practice.

Roshana Kelbrick . FIFA’s IP rights in South Africa

ARTICLE

331

Ambush marketing is deﬁned by Owen Dean in the ﬁrst
South African article to discuss this concept as follows:

for

instance a major

when a trader seeks to utilise the publicity value of an
event,
tournament or a
concert, to gain a beneﬁt from it despite not having any
involvement or connection with that event and more par-
ticularly having made no ﬁnancial contribution to entitle
him to derive beneﬁt from it.22

sports

He identiﬁes two forms. The second, which does not
concern us further, is the use of one’s own trade mark
by persons other than the organizers, in connection
with the event. The ﬁrst manifestation is described as
follows

Often a major event has a name, logo, or other insignia
identifying it. Unauthorised persons use these insignia, or
insignia which are sufﬁciently similar to the authentic
insignia to cause confusion.23

While I agree that FIFA World Cup or FIFA South
Africa 2010 might be considered such insignia, I do not
think that FIFA’s interpretation, which includes ‘Ofﬁcial
Marks’ such as world cup and 2010 used with either
soccer imagery or with the words ‘South Africa’ can be
considered an identifying logo and so entitled to pro-
tection. The extent of protection actually available in
terms of this section is unclear, and will only be clari-
ﬁed by the courts.

Section 19 of the Trade Practices Act makes any con-
travention of the Act,
including a contravention of
section 9(d), an offence, punishable by both a ﬁne and
imprisonment of up to 2 years as ﬁrst offender, and by
a ﬁne and a maximum of 5 years imprisonment for
subsequent contraventions.

Merchandise Marks Act 17 of 1941
Section 15(1) of the Merchandise Marks Act, inserted
in 1997, provides that

the Minister may, after such investigation as he or she may
think ﬁt, by notice in the Gazette, prohibit either absol-
utely or conditionally the use of

. . .
(b) any mark, word, letter or ﬁgure or any arrangement
or combination thereof,
in connection with any trade,
business, profession, occupation or event, or in connection
with a trade mark, mark or trade description applied to
goods.

Dealing with this section, the FIFA website states that
FIFA has applied to have its ofﬁcial marks declared
prohibited marks, and that unauthorized use of a pro-
hibited mark is an offence.24

The ofﬁcial South African website for the Soccer
World Cup conﬁrms this, stating that the Merchandise
Marks Act

gives the 2010 FIFA World CupTM protected event status, a
guarantee to protect FIFA’s intellectual property rights and
to prevent ‘ambush’ marketing.25

A recent notice in the Government Gazette contains a
long list of devices and words for which FIFA has
requested protection under the Merchandise Marks Act
17 of 1941.26 The devices include every World Cup
logo ever used. The words for which protection is
sought include the commonplace: world cup, 2010,
twenty ten, World Cup South Africa, Durban 2010, SA
2010, soccer world cup, to name but a few. The prohi-
bition is sought against the use of these words and
emblems ‘in connection with any event . . . other than
the use thereof by FIFA or its mandatories’.

Section 15(1) is far-reaching. Words and emblems
are prohibited ‘in connection with any trade, business,
profession, occupation or event, or in connection with
a trade mark, mark or trade description applied to
goods’. A list of some protected words is found in the
standard South African work on trade mark law.27
These words are mainly symbols or acronyms such as
the WWF and Panda device and the Springbok device,
but include words and symbols relating to previous
FIFA world cup events. In all
instances though, the
term world cup is linked to the country where and year
in which that world cup was held (for example World
Cup Germany 2006) or appears together with the
acronym FIFA. While some unsporting persons might
not view FIFA’s various world cup events as requiring
equal protection with UNICEF or the World Health
Organisation, opinions may differ.

But the most recent applications by FIFA are sub-
stantially broader in their ambit. They include the
phrase ‘world cup’ simpliciter and the numerals ‘2010’.
Arguably the phrase ‘South Africa 2010 World Cup’
is entitled to this kind of blanket protection—but
on what basis is ‘world cup’ or ‘2010’ so entitled?
To exclude others from using these words or numerals

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2008, Vol. 3, No. 5

occupation or event, or in connection with a trade
mark, mark or trade description applied to goods’ is
far-reaching. It clearly includes a prohibition on use as
a trade mark for goods and services. However, unlike
trade marks, no class is speciﬁed. So if viewed as a type
of trade mark, these words and numerals are protected
in respect of all goods and all services. Again, if viewed
as trade marks, these words or emblems are not subject
to the tests for registrability imposed by the Trade
Marks Act. Neither are they subject to the endorse-
ments recorded against the same words or emblems
registered in terms of
that Act. Thus, words and
numerals such as world cup, South Africa, and 2010
are not subject to disclaimers. Prohibition of use of the
phrase ‘world cup’ will also effectively prohibit use of
the Bartlett trade mark registrations by their registered
proprietor.

But

the prohibition is not merely on use ‘as a
trade mark’. Section 15(1)(b), couched in substantially
wider language, apparently prohibits any commercial
use of these words or symbols. If these FIFA appli-
cations are granted, South Africa 2010 cannot be used
to describe a vintage or a ﬂight schedule; neither can
the words ‘twenty ten’ be used as a trade description
for goods.

Section 15(3), read with section 20, makes contra-
vention an offence, punishable by (in the case of a ﬁrst
conviction) a ﬁne not exceeding R5000 for each article
to which the offence relates or imprisonment for a
period not exceeding 3 years or both such ﬁne and
such imprisonment, and for subsequent offences, by
ﬁnes not exceeding R10,000 per article and imprison-
ment for up to 5 years. Provision is also made for
conﬁscation of all contravening articles.

The Minister of Trade and Industry has stated:

. . . in deciding on this matter, I will also consider prin-
ciples contained in the Trade Marks Act, 1993 (Act No.
194 of 1993), dealing with issues considered before trade
marks are granted or not granted.28

I have dealt with the trade mark principles above in my
discussion of FIFA’s protection in terms of the Trade
Marks Act. It is debatable whether any words for which
protection is sought qualify for registration as trade
marks, either at all or without disclaimers. If the Minis-
ter does deal with the FIFA application using this
approach,
it seems unlikely that protection will be
granted to any of the proposed words or numerals
other than the acronym FIFA.

28 Notice 787 of 2007 (above).

Putting the boot in
FIFA refers to other legislation that offers protection,
but the Acts discussed above are the primary sources of
any type of infringement claim or criminal charge by
FIFA. In theory, FIFA may not object to bona ﬁde use
of terms that the public perceive as commonplace, and
may not pursue persons acting in ignorance of the
extent of FIFA’s protection. However, South African
newspapers contain many reports of action taken by
FIFA.
‘FIFA puts the boot in’ states that the Sunday
Times Metro in respect of a company name ‘South
African Dream 2010’ registered 3 years before South
Africa won the rights to stage the 2010 FIFA World
Cup (Sunday Times Metro, 11 February 2007, p. 1).
Another report states that lawyers acting for FIFA have
barred about 20 entrepreneurs from using 2010 as part
of the name of their business, many of whom adopted
these numerals before they had alleged other signiﬁ-
cance (Saturday Star, 24 February 2007). Most recently,
FIFA’s local attorneys announced their intention to
launch a test case to determine whether a registered
design infringed its rights (Business Day, 25 October
2007). There are numerous similar articles. FIFA thus
appears to have taken action against anyone using the
term ‘world cup’ or the numerals 2010.

In theory, FIFA may not object to bona fide use
of terms that the public perceive as commonplace,
and may not pursue persons acting in ignorance
of the extent of FIFA’s protection

The following quotation is from the preamble to the
2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa Special Measures
Act 11 of 2006

AND WHEREAS the Government of
the Republic of
South Africa has a duty to pursue major developmental
goals as demanded by the Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa, 1996, as reﬂected in broad initiatives to
eradicate poverty by 2014 which have been endorsed by
the people of South Africa and the United Nations, the
Government must strike a balance between the broad
national interests of the Republic and the speciﬁc interests
of FIFA when implementing its guarantees.

Threats and litigation against the general public and
small traders who have been promised an economic
miracle by the 2010 FIFA World Cup, will not advance

such goals. It is to be hoped that the South African
government and courts remember their duty to support
the national interests when considering FIFA’s requests
for protection. The government did not undertake to
create rights where none exist, nor to limit the rights of
others, but merely to acknowledge existing rights.

Postscript
The Minister of Trade and Industry had undertaken to
deal with FIFA’s request bearing trade-mark principles
in mind, and his eventual decision, in General Notice
1791 in Government Gazette no. 30595 of 14 December
2007, reﬂects such principles. Only recent logos and
those combinations of words which include references

football, have been
to both FIFA and soccer or
included. All applications for the mascots of previous
FIFA World Cup games, and the logos for such events,
have been refused. Additionally, the prohibition reads
that it ‘only applies to activities connected to 2010
FIFA World Cup SOUTH AFRICA in the area of Foot-
ball or Soccer 2010 FIFA World Cup. The prohibition
does not apply to the media, provided the reportage is
fair and not imbued with unscrupulous business enter-
prising’. No doubt this proviso will be interpreted by
the courts in due course.
