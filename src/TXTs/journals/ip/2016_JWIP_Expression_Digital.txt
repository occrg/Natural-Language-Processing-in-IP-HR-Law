The Freedom of Expression Contours of Copyright
in the Digital Era: A European Perspective

Elena Izyumenko
CEIPI, University of Strasbourg

This paper analyses the inﬂuence of the right to freedom of expression and information on European copyright law in
the digital context. Drawing on the practice of the two major European courts—the European Court of Human Rights
(ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)—it begins by exploring how this fundamental right
shapes both the scope of copyright protection in Europe and what is traditionally termed as “exceptions and
limitations” to exclusive rights. Speciﬁcally, a long-standing practice of the ECtHR, in accordance with which
copyright in turn may be viewed as an exception to freedom of expression and must hence be narrowly interpreted, is
scrutinized. On a related note, a recent recourse by the CJEU to the language of “users’ rights” is examined, inasmuch
as it allows for a reconceptualization—in a normative framework of freedom of information—of copyright
“exceptions” not as the exceptions as such, but as the equal rights of users of protected subject-matter. In this regard,
the locus standi of “mere users” of online content and the somewhat diverging approaches of the Strasbourg and
Luxemburg courts toward granting thereof are addressed. The paper then turns to discuss the recent recourse by the
European courts to freedom of expression as a means to deﬁne the role of internet service providers in digital copyright
enforcement, implicating issues ranging from the providers’ liability in respect of the third-party content posted online
to the often far-reaching injunctions imposed on non-liable intermediaries. Several conclusions are drawn from the
above analysis, reﬂecting on the potential of freedom of expression and information to inform the development of
European standards applicable in the ﬁeld of digital copyright.

Keywords freedom of expression; copyright; users’ rights; Internet

Over the past few years, European courts, responsive to the growing expansion of copyright protection,
and notably its enforcement mechanisms in the digital environment, have been devoting increased
attention to freedom of expression and information as a mechanism of external constraints on copyright
law. The present paper analyses this recent dynamic, which deviates from the conventional approach
toward copyright law as a legal regime wherein any potential conﬂict with freedom of expression has been
already resolved internally through the idea/expression dichotomy and the so-called “exceptions and
limitations” to copyright. The ﬁrst section outlines the recent case law of the European Court of Human
Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), explicitly dislodging the
copyright’s immunity from external free speech checks. The newly emerging concept of “users’ rights”
engendered by this approach is scrutinized in section two. The third and ﬁnal section concentrates on how
the right to freedom of expression is inﬂuencing the role of online intermediaries in copyright enforcement
process—an issue that is now at the center of policy discussions on the future of EU copyright.1

Freedom of Expression as an External Limit to Copyright
The ECtHR: An Exception-to-Rule Paradigm
Whereas no later than at the end of 90s the European Commission of Human Rights was contending on the
unusualness—if not the lack of competence—for it to resolve a conﬂict between copyright and freedom of
expression,2 recent years have seen a notable increase in the involvement of Strasbourg judges in
regulating copyright disputes.

The Freedom of Expression Contours of Copyright

Since 2013, the Court has rendered three important copyright decisions in which the freedom of
expression and information was at stake. Not without a reason, all these cases centered upon unauthorized
dissemination of copyright-protected works on the internet.

The ﬁrst case, Ashby Donald and Others v France, concerned the conviction in France of the three
fashion photographers for copyright
infringement, following unauthorized online publication of
photographs of designers’ clothes taken by one of them at the fashion shows in Paris.3 The ECtHR,
which had been called upon to decide whether the posting of the photographs on an internet fashion
magazine managed by two of the applicants amounted to a proportionate exercise of freedom of
expression, categorically admitted the latter’s relevance to the dispute at issue. The Court noted in
particular that the publication of photographs, even for sale and in breach of national copyright laws,4 was
covered by freedom of expression, guaranteed under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human
Rights (ECHR) (Council of Europe, 1950). The applicants’ convictions hence constituted an interference
with that provision.5 Although no violation was found on the merits of the case,6 the relevance of external
freedom of expression checks and balances to the disputes traditionally conferred exclusively to copyright
law was clearly admitted by the ECtHR. The Court has also advanced a number of criteria for shaping—
from the freedom of expression perspective—the so-called “exceptions and limitations” to copyright
protection,7 but also the scope thereof.8

Shortly following the above developments, yet another case on conﬂicting copyright and freedom of
expression was rendered by the Strasbourg Court in early 2013.9 The issue revolved this time around
notorious The Pirate Bay ﬁle-sharing service, the co-founders of which were convicted in Sweden for
complicity to commit crimes in violation of the Swedish Copyright Act in that they had furthered, through
their service, the other persons’ infringement of copyright concerning music, ﬁlms and computer games.
Similarly to the French case, the ECtHR was of the opinion that domestic copyright regulation that resulted
in ﬁnding the applicants liable for their involvement in the running of a website interfered with Article 10
ECHR. In the Court’s view, insofar as The Pirate Bay provided—albeit in breach of copyright law—the
means for others to impart and receive information, running of this ﬁle-sharing platform was afforded
Article 10 protection. Nevertheless, no violation of the applicants’ expression was established this time
either, for reasons largely similar to those advanced by the Court in Ashby Donald.10

Most recently, in a case of Akdeniz from March 2014, the ECtHR was confronted with an issue of
blocking access in Turkey to the websites myspace.com and last.fm because they were disseminating musical
works in violation of copyright.11 The applicant, who was a regular user of the websites, complained about
the collateral effects of blocking, which amounted, according to him, to a disproportionate response based on
Article 10 ECHR. Whereas admitting the need to balance in the cases such as this one the possibly conﬂicting
copyright and freedom to receive information,12 the Court nevertheless stated that the sole fact that the
applicant—like other Turkish users of the two music-sharing websites—had been indirectly affected by
blocking did not sufﬁce for him to be regarded as a “victim” for the Convention purposes.13 The Court noted
in particular that the blocking did not concern the applicant’s own website14 and neither did it deprive the
applicant of other—legitimate—ways of accessing the musical works at issue.15

Although in all these cases the applicants lost, the above decisions share one important feature—an
approach to copyright as an exception to the right to freedom of expression. This approach, rather natural to
Convention organs, inasmuch as the case is lodged under Article 10 ECHR, might strike as unusual a
European copyright scholar, accustomed to a quite opposite perspective: of copyright being a rule, with all
unauthorized uses thereof constituting (at most) an “exception” or “limitation” to it. In accordance with
this latter approach, repeatedly echoed by the CJEU, any derogation from the “general principle” of
copyright protection “must be interpreted strictly”.16

The new, Strasbourg Court-driven perspective on copyright law clearly challenges this premise.
Coming as a response to a failure by the European legislator to provide a ﬂexible framework to regulate the

116

rapidly changing technological reality, it calls for the reconsideration of what is traditionally termed as
“exceptions” to copyright protection. This is all the more so in the light of the long-established recognition
in Europe of the need to construe “strictly” and with particular vigilance any exception to freedom of
expression.17 Considering that many copyright exceptions derive their legitimacy from this fundamental
right and that copyright itself has been recognized by the ECtHR as an exception to freedom of
expression,18 a strictly restrictive approach of the EU legislator to copyright protection does not sustain the
human rights test.

The CJEU: A “Fair Balancing” Exercise
Although the rhetoric of “strict interpretation” of copyright exceptions occasionally re-occurs in the
Luxemburg Court’s case law, the parallel tendency of “fair balancing” of all competing rights and interests
at stake seems to be gradually taking place of this restrictive approach. It is also “mainly from the angle of
fundamental rights”19—and not the secondary copyright legislation—that the examination of many
intellectual property (IP) disputes implicating the rights of users in the digital context starts being
conducted by the Luxemburg judges.

In one of the ﬁrst of such cases, Scarlet Extended v SABAM, the CJEU held that a fair balance had to be
struck between copyright and the internet users’ freedom of information when it concerned an injunction
requiring an internet access provider to ﬁlter and subsequently block all electronic communications on its
services liable to infringe copyright.20 In the Court’s view, adopting such an injunction, which was to be
applied indiscriminately to all users and for an unlimited period of time, would have amounted to a
violation of Article 11 (freedom of expression and information) of the EU Charter (European Union,
2000),21 as it might not have distinguished properly between unlawful and lawful content, with the
potential result of blocking lawful communications.22

A similar conclusion was reached by the Court in SABAM v Netlog with regards to injuncting
the hosting provider (in this case—the owner of an online social networking platform), to ﬁlter, with
a view to blocking, information stored on its services by its users in order to prevent any copyright-
infringing activity.23 For the reasons analogous to those advanced in Scarlet Extended, the effects
of such injunction were likewise regarded by the Court as violative of the information rights of
users.24

Most recently, in UPC Telekabel, which—alike Akdeniz from the Strasbourg Court—revolved
around an issue of website blocking for the purpose of copyright enforcement, the Court once again
highlighted the need to externally balance copyright with freedom of information.25 The case concerned
ordering a major Austrian internet access provider, UPC Telekabel Wien GmbH, to block access of its
customers to the website kino.to, offering the copyright-protected ﬁlms for streaming or download
without the consent of the rightholders. The crux of the case was in that the order was result-oriented,
that is to say—it did not specify the means by which the internet service provider (ISP) should have
achieved the blocking.

The CJEU held that such an order (the so-called “outcome prohibition”)26 was legitimate in
principle, but made it necessary to reconcile, among others, copyright with freedom of information of
internet users.27 In order to achieve such a reconciliation, the Court held, the blocking should have been
“strictly targeted” in the sense of not unnecessarily depriving internet users of access to legitimate
content.28 Furthermore, the CJEU was of the opinion that the users were to be accorded standing before
the national courts once the implementing measures liable to infringe their information rights were
known.29

As could be seen from UPC Telekabel and other cases discussed above, the CJEU, alike the ECtHR, is
repeatedly taking a position that the freedom of expression interests should be accounted for in the
copyright discourse, especially as far as the digital environment is concerned.30

The Freedom of Expression Contours of Copyright

The Rights of Users
Substantive Content
Much in line with the reconceptualization by both European courts of the place of freedom of expression in
copyright sphere, the so-called “users’ rights”—understood as the equal rights of users of protected
subject-matter, and not as mere defences in a copyright infringement suit—are progressively taking shape
in European copyright law and policy.31

Starting with Padawan in 2010,32 the CJEU has been repeatedly stating, with reference to recital 31 in
the preamble to InfoSoc Directive,33 that exceptions to copyright “seek to achieve a ‘fair balance’ between,
in particular, the rights and interests of authors on the one hand, and the rights of users of protected subject-
matter on the other”.34 In most of such cases, it was freedom of expression and information that gave a
substantive content to the rights of users.35 In Deckmyn, for example, it was “not disputed” by the CJEU
that the parody exception that was at stake in that case was “an appropriate way to express an opinion”.36 It
hence followed that the rights of authors were to be balanced not against the exception for parody, but
against the right to “freedom of expression of the user of a protected work” relying on that exception.37
Similarly, in Painer (on quotation exception), it was from the angle of “fair balancing” of the users’ right to
freedom of expression against the reproduction right conferred on authors that the situation at issue was
resolved.38 Most recently, in Ulmer from September 2014, the CJEU characterized the right to digitize
works contained in the publicly accessible libraries collections as an “ancillary right” that such
establishments enjoyed as the users of protected works wishing to communicate them to the public.39

Procedural Guarantees: Users’ Locus Standi
However, perhaps the most distinct recognition of users’ rights came with the Luxemburg Court’s
judgment in UPC Telekabel. As noted above, the CJEU was of the opinion in that case that, in order to
safeguard the freedom of information of the ISP’s customers, “the national procedural rules must provide a
possibility for internet users to assert their rights before the court once the implementing measures taken by
the internet service provider are known”.40 A hereby recognized locus standi of users came as a vivid
illustration of the important differences between safeguarding the information freedoms through the
“mere” defences to copyright infringement or by means of “rights”—that is to say, legal claims calling,
among others, for procedural safeguards of their implementation.

Securing that the users are granted standing on free expression grounds, particularly in the context of
progressively expanding copyright enforcement measures, is indeed much needed in the democracy-
sensitive and rapidly changing online environment. As observed by Article 19, a reputable independent
human rights organization working to protect and promote the right to freedom of expression, the proper
“mechanisms for users to appeal against decisions by ISPs to censor user-generated content” are currently
lacking in the EU (ARTICLE 19, 2016).41 Majority of national courts habitually undertake proportionality
analysis with regards to the rights of copyright holders, ISPs and (at most) infringers, but not the affected
users. As such, it is submitted that in some countries “extraordinary circumstances seem to be required
before a court would take third parties into account when balancing interests” (Savola, 2014, paragraph
54).42 The CJEU had since UPC Telekabel obliged the national procedural rules to remedy this situation,
albeit within a quite limited context of the result-tailored prohibitions.

Likewise noteworthy in this respect is an Opinion of the Advocate General J€a€askinen in L’Oreal and
Others, even though the case concerned trademarks and not copyright. As pointed therein, freedom of
expression and information “entails that the protection of trade mark proprietor’s rights in the context of
electronic commerce may not take forms that would infringe the rights of innocent users of an electronic
marketplace or leave the alleged infringer without due possibilities of opposition and defence.”43

Despite the clear growth in attention to the rights of users in IP cases, it must, however, be admitted
that the European law still leaves a fair share of controversy on the issue of users’ locus standi on free

118

expression grounds. First, as already mentioned, the UPC Telekabel Court envisaged a mandatory
provision on the users’ standing only with regard to a quite peculiar construction of an outcome prohibition
and alike. Under the procedural laws of certain Member States comparable types of orders are simply not
envisaged (Angelopoulos, 2014; Husovec, 2014, p. 633). For those States the question of the users’
capacity to bring proceedings challenging the measure-speciﬁc blocking orders might still need to be
fought out in their respective courts.44

Finally, the recent judicial practice of the ECtHR does not add much clarity on the users’ rights issue.
Speciﬁcally, the Strasbourg Court’s decision in Akdeniz (discussed above) suggests that no victim-status
can be asserted by the “mere user” of a website being blocked for breach of copyright.45 According to the
ECtHR, the locus standi seems to be available for those only who own the websites affected46 or actively
impart information on the internet,47 and not those who “simply” use such websites. This stance might,
however, appear in contradiction to that of the CJEU in both UPC Telekabel and SABAM cases, all of
which indeed concerned the effects of website blocking on the rights of the “mere” users to freely receive
and impart information. Moreover, in SABAM cases the balancing of interests at issue even resulted in
favouring the rights of users over those of the rightholders.

The ISPs Role in Digital Copyright Enforcement: Toward a Private-Party Censorship?
As could be noted from above, much of the issues at the intersection of copyright and freedom of
expression in the digital environment arise from the rapidly evolving techniques of copyright enforcement
online,48 most of which are characterized by shifting enforcement burdens on the intermediaries.49

The mechanisms through which the ISPs are getting more actively involved in the digital copyright
enforcement process boil down, very generally, to secondary liability and injunctive relief. Under the
former, the ISPs may be held liable for the infringing acts of their users, whereas injunctive relief insures
that intermediaries would cooperate in terminating or preventing an online infringement, even if no ground
for their own liability can be established.

Both the secondary liability and injunctions regimes, however, pose a risk of the private-party
censorship “chilling” freedom of expression online. Thus, uncertainties surrounding the circumstances
under which the ISPs can be held liable for the third-party infringement of copyright provide strong
incentives to overblock, just in case, substantial portions of legitimate content. Analogously, ambiguity as
to the scope of injunctions that can reasonably be required from intermediaries in order to “effectively”
enforce copyright and associated fears of coercive penalties for non-compliance, may lead to additional
self-censorship by the ISPs.

It is, therefore, not surprising that the courts in Europe had had recourse to the right to freedom of
expression and information in testing the boundaries of the ISPs’ liability for the third-parties’
infringements of copyright and in determining which types of injunctions could be allowed against non-
liable intermediaries in order to tackle the so-called online “piracy”.

Liability
In the EU, the limits of the ISPs’ liability are set forth in Articles 12–4 of the E-Commerce Directive,50
providing for the so-called “safe harbour” exemptions from liability for the three categories of service
providers: “mere conduit”, “caching” and hosting. In order to qualify for “safe harbours”, however, the
service providers have to fulﬁl certain conditions. Notably, they should act as “passive” intermediaries,
that is to say—they should have “neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is
transmitted or stored.”51 The “mere conduit” and “caching” service providers, in particular, beneﬁt from
safe harbours when they are “in no way[s] involved with the information transmitted; this requires among
other things that [they] do[] not modify the information that [they] transmit[].”52 As regards the hosting
providers, in order to beneﬁt from a limitation of liability, they have to “act expeditiously to remove or to

disable access to the information concerned” “upon obtaining actual knowledge or awareness of illegal
activities”.53 However, apart from these general provisions on liability outlined in the E-Commerce
Directive, the exact conditions under which intermediaries could be deemed passive, or neutral, remain
fragmented under European law, and the CJEU has already been called upon on several occasions to ﬁll
into this legislative gap.

In Google France and Google, for example, the Court held that Article 14 (hosting) E-Commerce
“safe harbour” applied to an internet referencing service provider, such as Google’s “AdWords”, in the
case where that service provider had not played an active role of such a kind as to give it knowledge of, or
control over, the data stored.54 If it had not played such a role, that service provider could not be held liable
for the data which it had stored at the request of an advertiser, unless, having obtained knowledge of the
unlawful nature of those data or of that advertiser’s activities, it had failed to act expeditiously to remove or
to disable access to the data concerned.55 Although leaving it for the national court to decide whether the
role played by Google was neutral, the Court provided some guidance as to what criteria could be decisive
in such an examination.56 It observed in particular that the mere fact that the advertising service was
subject to payment, that Google set the payment terms or that it provided general information to its clients
could not have had the effect of depriving Google of the exemptions from liability.57

By contrast, as was made clear in L’Oreal and Others, when the online-marketplace operator provided
assistance which entailed the knowledge of, or control over, the data relating to the information it stored, its
position could not be considered as neutral.58

Further clariﬁcations of the neutrality rule have followed, nevertheless, not from the CJEU, as could
have been expected, but from another principal supranational court in Europe—the ECtHR. The case at
issue, Delﬁ v Estonia, revolved around the question of liability (or the lack thereof) of online platforms for
the clearly infringing content generated by their users.59 In Estonia, the owner of one of the country’s
largest internet news portals, Delﬁ, was held liable for defamatory comments posted by its readers in the
portal’s online commenting environment. Despite the fact that the comments were removed by Delﬁ
immediately upon notiﬁcation by the injured person’s lawyers (which happened though some six weeks
after they were uploaded on the website), Estonian Supreme Court found the portal liable for failing to
remove the comments on its own initiative immediately after they had been published. In ruling so, it
rejected the portal’s argument that its liability, as a hosting provider, was excluded under Article 14 of the
E-Commerce Directive. It held in particular that the activities of the portal in publishing the comments
were not merely of a technical, automatic and passive nature. In this connection, it had regard to the fact
that the readers were actively called to comment on the news items appearing on the portal; the defendant
had an economic interest in the posting of comments, which increased the number of visits to the portal and
hence a revenue earned from advertisements; the portal, in contrast to the users who could no longer delete
or modify a comment once it was uploaded, had an active control over the commenting environment. It
followed that the applicant company was to be classiﬁed as an active intermediary (media publisher),
including with regard to its users’ comments, with a consequence that the E-Commerce Directive did not
apply. Instead, the Supreme Court relied on the national Obligations Act, in accordance with which Delﬁ
could not be exempt from liability for the publication of the clearly unlawful content.

Before the ECtHR, Delﬁ complained that holding it liable for the comments posted by its readers
infringed its freedom to impart information as provided in Article 10 ECHR.60 It argued in particular
that there was no domestic law according to which an intermediary had to be taken as a professional
publisher of comments posted on its website by third parties regardless of whether it was aware of their
speciﬁc content. It further argued that ﬁnding it liable would have left it with two choices: to either over-
censor any sensitive comments “that could be labelled defamatory (or that could infringe intellectual
property rights, inter alia)”;61 or to simply avoid any liability risks by shutting down the comment feature
altogether.62

In its Grand Chamber judgment delivered in June 2015, the Court held, by 15 votes to 2, that ﬁnding
Delﬁ liable had not infringed upon its right to freedom of expression. Although acknowledging that
the difference in the parties’ opinions as regards applicability of the E-Commerce Directive stemmed
from their diverging views on the issue of how the applicant company was to be classiﬁed,63 it,
however, found that it was for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law.64 Thereby, the
ECtHR avoided pronouncing on the appropriateness of the domestic courts’ decision not to apply the
E-Commerce Directive, limiting itself to examining whether the application of the general provisions of
the Obligations Act to the applicant’s situation was foreseeable and proportionate for the purposes of
Article 10(2) ECHR.

As concerned the law’s foreseeability, it held that Delﬁ, as a professional publisher and one of the
largest news portals in Estonia, in relation to which there was moreover a known public concern about the
controversial nature of the comments it attracted, was in a position to assess risks related to its activity.65
As to the proportionality of an interference with the applicant’s freedom to impart information, the
Court conceded, ﬁrst, with the domestic courts’ reasoning that Delﬁ’s involvement in making public the
comments on its news articles went beyond that of a passive, purely technical service provider.66 It further
noted that shifting the liability risks from the actual authors of the comments to the service provider “was
not as such a disproportionate interference with the media company’s right to freedom of expression”,67
regard being had to the “uncertain effectiveness of measures allowing the identity of the authors of the
comments to be established” and a better ﬁnancial position of the media company.68 Thirdly, although
acknowledging that Delﬁ took certain measures to ﬁlter comments with clearly unlawful contents,69 the
Court regarded those measures as insufﬁcient.70 Hence the Contracting States were entitled “to impose
liability on internet news portals, without contravening Article 10 of the Convention, if they fail[ed] to take
measures to remove clearly unlawful comments without delay, even without notice from the alleged victim
or from third parties”.71 Finally, the Court considered that the modest sum Delﬁ had been ordered to pay in
compensation for non-pecuniary damage (EUR 320) did not compromise the proportionality of the
interference with the applicant’s expression on that account either.72

Although Delﬁ was not concerned with copyright as such, it illustrates a general idea. The Court has
approved, with 15 votes against 2, a liability system that imposes a requirement of constructive knowledge
on active internet intermediaries.73 That means that “active intermediaries must remove comments
‘without delay’ after publication. . ., and not upon notice or on other grounds linked to actual
knowledge.”74 The two dissenting judges, however, voiced the potential troubling consequences of this
standard, naming it no less than “an invitation to self-censorship at its worst”.75 According to them, “[t]o
avoid trouble, for active intermediaries the safe harbour [would] simply be to disable comments”,76 and
“the fear of liability may lead to additional self-censorship by operators.”77 At the same time, “[i]n the
overwhelming majority of the member States of the Council of Europe, and also in genuine democracies
all over the world, the regulatory system (in conformity with the expectations of the rule of law) is based on
the concept of actual knowledge. A safe harbour is provided by the rule of notice and action (primarily
‘notice and take down’).”78 The dissenting judges further observed that “[n]either the domestic authorities
nor the Court explain[ed] why the provision of binding European law that [was] part of the national legal
system [had been] immaterial, except to say that the present case concern[ed] a matter of publication rather
than data storage.”79 Although conceding that it was not for the Strasbourg Court to interpret EU law as
such, this did not mean that this law was not a part of the domestic system.80 To the contrary, the national
incorporation of the E-Commerce Directive provided a “safe harbour” rule for service providers in the case
of storage, and hence a reasonable justiﬁcation was required, in the dissenting judges’ opinion, for the
choice of the higher level of liability.81

Neither did it follow that the publisher’s liability was foreseeable.82 According to the dissenting
judges, the applicable law was not obvious and “[o]nly divine legal counsel could have been sufﬁciently

certain that a portal operator would be liable for a comment it was not aware of, under a kind of strict
liability that applied to publishers (editors) who operated in full knowledge of the whole publication.”83
As to the proportionality of an interference with Delﬁ’s right to enable others to impart and receive
information and associated balancing approach,
the dissenting judges pointed to a number of
considerations that had been left out of the Court’s analysis, including the fact that the interference
the debate was on a matter of public interest.84
concerned the press and journalism and that
Inappropriateness of “equat[ing] the expressions used by the commenters with the activities of an active
intermediary” had also been highlighted.85

It needs to be noted, however, that, since Delﬁ, the ECtHR seemed to have attempted to remedy its
rather radical approach toward the standards of liability for online intermediaries. In a judgment in the
MTE case rendered in February 2016, the Court ruled that holding an ISP liable for the infringing content
posted by its users indeed violated that ISP’s freedom of expression.86 The two main considerations that, in
the opinion of the Court, distinguished this case from Delﬁ were: (i) the nature of the content at issue
(which did not constitute, as in Delﬁ, clearly unlawful hate speech) and (ii) the non-for-proﬁt status of one
of the applicants in MTE.87 No analysis was advanced with regards to the neutrality rule though.

It remains only to be seen what consequences this disparate practice, coupled with the lack of clarity
with respect to the secondary liability of online intermediaries and their role in policing their users’ content
will bring for freedom of information, net neutrality and digital IP enforcement in Europe.

Injunctions
Distinct from the question of liability, a separate regime implicating a greater involvement of the ISPs in
copyright enforcement and speech-regulation online is that of the injunctive relief. As the E-Commerce
Directive makes it clear, “[t]he limitations of the liability of intermediary service providers established in
this Directive do not affect the possibility of injunctions of different kinds; such injunctions can in
particular consist of orders by courts or administrative authorities requiring the termination or prevention
of any infringement, including the removal of illegal information or the disabling of access to it.”88 The
legal basis of injunctions rests upon Articles 12(3), 13(2), and 14(3) of the E-Commerce Directive, as well
as on the almost identical wording of Articles 8(3) InfoSoc and Article 11, third sentence, of the
Enforcement Directive.89 In addition, although not saying anything on the level of speciﬁcity of
injunctions, Article 15 of the E-Commerce Directive outlaws the general monitoring obligation.

As pointed in the EU Study on the Single Market for the Information Society, “[t]he possibility to issue
injunctions against service providers should not be underestimated: while liability claims against mere
conduit service providers (and caching service providers) are not important in court practice, injunctions
are frequently issued against them” (DLA Piper, 2009, p. 21).

However, much alike the issue with secondary liability, “[t]he conditions and modalities relating to
such injunctions [are] left to the national law of the Member States”,90 generating concerns about the
collateral private-party censorship of online content.

These concerns have already led the CJEU to outlaw the general ﬁltering systems at issue in SABAM
cases as being contrary to the EU law, but also and foremost—to its fundamental rights legal order. The
Court held in particular with regards to freedom to receive and impart information of the ISP’s customers
that such systems could result in a violation thereof.91 In the Court’s view, an injunction requiring an
intermediary to install, as a preventive measure and for an unlimited period, a permanent ﬁltering system
blocking all electronic communications on its services liable to infringe copyright, did not appear to
guarantee the blockage only of exchanges speciﬁcally identiﬁable as unlawful, potentially affecting lawful
communications.92 The CJEU had particular regard to the fact that lawfulness or otherwise of a given
transmission depended on the application of statutory exceptions to copyright which varied from country
to country and therefore fell outside the sphere of technology.93

The Freedom of Expression Contours of Copyright

Elena Izyumenko

The need to preserve a “strictly targeted” character of blocking had been likewise highlighted by the
CJEU in UPC Telekabel,94 where the Court stressed that the blocking “must serve to bring an end to a third
party’s infringement of copyright or of a related right but without thereby affecting internet users who are
using the provider’s services in order to lawfully access information.”95 Failing that, according to the
Court, “the provider’s interference in the freedom of information of those users would be unjustiﬁed in
the light of the objective pursued.”96

It worth, however, noting that—unlike in SABAM cases—the measure at issue in UPC Telekabel was
not outlawed by the CJEU per se. The Court simply shifted a great share of responsibility for ensuring a
“strictly targeted” character of blocking to the ISPs. According to the Court, it was for an intermediary to
ensure, when choosing which blocking measure to adopt in order to comply with an outcome prohibition,
that the fundamental right of internet users to freedom of information had been complied with. Failing that,
an ISP could fear a freedom of information dispute with its customers.97 Arguably, there might have been
better ways to reconcile the conﬂicting copyright and freedom of information at stake, one of which would
be agreeing with Advocate General, in whose opinion the outcome prohibition simply was not precise
enough to comply with the Union legal order, given that “[w]hether complete prevention of the outcome is
possible at all and whether the measures necessary for that purpose take account of the parties’
fundamental rights is not examined before the outcome prohibition is issued”.98 According to the Advocate
General, the result-tailored injunctions (unlike the speciﬁc ones) thus failed in regard to proportionality
“[i]n logical terms alone”, but also in light of the case law requirement that a balance of rights is observed
when, not after, the injunction is issued.99

All in all, although particular means of preserving the users’ information freedoms might be a subject
of discussion, the general message from the Luxemburg judges remains clear—copyright enforcement
should be safeguarded from collateral effects.

The same message is being transmitted by the Strasbourg Court which, in one of its ﬁrst cases on
website blocking made it clear that any blocking measure rendering—absent the tight control over the
scope of the ban—large quantities of information inaccessible, “substantially restrict[s] the rights of
internet users and ha[s] a signiﬁcant collateral effect”.100 The case at issue, Yıldırım, concerned the
blocking in Turkey of an entire internet domain (Google Sites) in the context of criminal proceedings
brought against a single third-party website. Before the ECtHR, the applicant complained that the blocking
made it impossible for him to access his own website hosted on the same internet domain, but which had no
connection with the illegal content that had given rise to blocking. In ruling on a violation of Article 10 of
the Convention, the Court considered that the blocking produced signiﬁcant collateral effects, whereas the
judicial-review procedures concerning the order were insufﬁcient to meet the criteria for avoiding
abuse.101

In Akdeniz, that followed two years after, the Court reafﬁrmed that “any measure blocking access to a
website had to be part of a particularly strict legal framework ensuring both tight control over the scope of
the ban and effective judicial review to prevent possible abuse, because it could have signiﬁcant effects of
‘collateral censorship’”.102 That was not the case, however, in Akdeniz, where the blocking targeted
speciﬁcally the infringing websites and not—as in Yıldırım—all websites hosted on the same internet
domain with an infringing one.

Summing up, an emerging European case law on injunctions suggests that those are most likely to be
dismissed on the freedom of expression grounds once a strong likelihood of the adverse chilling effects on
legitimate information is established. At the same time, the collateral effects on legitimate content do not
impose an unconditional ban on enforcement. As it concerns in particular the website blocking, the studies
on their different techniques demonstrate that each blocking measure carries the risk of overblocking
(Ofcom, 2010, p. 4 et seq.). The most problematic in this regard is IP address blocking, since multiple
websites commonly share a single IP address. As a result, the blocking of one of such websites leads to an

automatic block of all of its “neighbours” (Ofcom, 2010, p. 30). It is for this reason the Antwerp Court of
Appeals, for example, expressly dismissed IP address blocking based on a strong likelihood of collateral
effects on the websites sharing the same IP address with The Pirate Bay.103 Then again, if only
unsubstantial portion of legitimate content is affected by blocking, it is likely to be considered
proportionate, as inter alia the recent decision of the ECtHR in Akdeniz demonstrated.104

Conclusion
In conclusion, although it is apparent that the European courts are having hard times ﬁguring out the
standards applicable in the ﬁeld of digital copyright, the case law of recent years marks an important shift.
It points to a greater consideration of the interests of all parties to copyright enforcement process, including
those of the internet users.

The fact that the external freedom-of-expression checks and tests have been admitted to the internal
copyright regulation is important, as it provides a weighty counter-balance to some one-sided digital
copyright enforcement strategies.105 The CJEU has even went as far as to mandate the “users’ rights”
which could be enforced in courts,106 hence arguably being more attentive to freedom of expression than
was the ECtHR in its ﬁrst case on copyright-defensive website blocking.107 From this perspective, it can be
said that the CJEU moves toward understanding of freedom of information as an integral part of the
European copyright order in full recognition of its underlying rationales. On the other hand, it also appears
that both European courts expect online intermediaries to be very actively involved in copyright
enforcement process, which might prove problematic in terms of prior restraints and the private-party
censorship.

All this leaves without doubt a wide room for further clariﬁcations, all the more precious in
anticipation of the EU obligatory accession to the ECHR,108 which is likely to only reinforce the current
tendency to test copyright and its enforcement strategies from the angle of fundamental rights.

1. See e.g. European Commission (2015), listing clariﬁcation of the rules on intermediaries in relation to copyright-

protected content among the priorities of the Juncker Commission.

2. ECommHR, Societe Nationale de Programmes FRANCE 2 v France (dec.), no. 30262/96, 15 January 1997:
“[The Commission] recalls that it is normally not for the Convention organs to resolve, under paragraph 2 of
Article 10 (Article 10–2), the conﬂicts which may arise between, on the one hand, the right to freely
communicate information and, on the other hand, the right of authors whose works are communicated”
(translation from French by the author). For an overview of the case law of the ECtHR and its former
Commission in the ﬁeld of copyright and freedom of expression, as well as of some cases from national European
jurisdictions, see, among others, Hugenholtz (2001); Geiger (2004); Strowel and Tulkens (2006); Strowel
(2014); Voorhoof (2015).

3. ECtHR, Ashby Donald and Others v France, no. 36769/08, 10 January 2013.
4. In France, both designers’ clothes and fashion shows are protected by copyright, provided that they display
original character. Accordingly, the fashion houses concerned were entitled to authorise or forbid the
reproduction or dissemination of their creations (Ashby Donald (supra note 3), paragraph 13).

5. Ashby Donald (supra note 3), paragraph 34.
6. This was largely due to the nature of information disseminated (not contributing, in the Court’s opinion, to the
public debate of general interest) and commercial undertones of the applicants’ actions. An important factor in
favoring the rights of the fashion houses over those of the photographers was also the weight afforded by the
ECtHR to the protection of intellectual property. According to the Court, the interests of copyright holders
themselves beneﬁted from the Convention protection afforded by Article 1 of First Protocol (protection of
property) to the ECHR. It thus followed that the Court had to balance two competing interests both protected by
the Convention—a delicate exercise, leaving the States a wide margin of discretion in regulating the dispute at
issue (Ashby Donald (supra note 3), paragraph 40).

7. An “exception” at issue in Ashby Donald was that for the purpose of news reporting, envisaged in Article L. 122–
5 9° of the French Intellectual Property Code—a national transposition of Article 5(3)(c) of the Directive 2001/
29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of
copyright and related rights in the information society (InfoSoc) [2001] OJ L 167/10.

8. Among such criteria are: the nature of information disseminated; the character of expression; the comparative

importance of a counterbalanced interest; the proportionality of the restrictions, etc.

14. Id., paragraph 27.
15. The Court noted further that the websites were blocked because they did not comply with copyright legislation
and that neither the collateral effects of blocking, nor the nature and the character of disseminated information
were such as to raise an important question of general interest (Akdeniz (supra note 11), paragraphs 25, 26 and
28).

League and Others, C-403/08 and C-429/08, EU:C:2011:631, paragraph 162.

17. This principle has been summarised by the ECtHR as follows: “As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is
subject to exceptions, which . . . must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must
be established convincingly”. See, among many others, ECtHR, Delﬁ AS v Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09,
