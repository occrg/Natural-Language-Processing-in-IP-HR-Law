The scope of protection of patent claims in
Europe and the UPC
Paul England*

Article 69 of the European Patent Convention (EPC)
states that the extent of the protection conferred by a
European patent or a European patent application shall
be determined by the terms of the claims, using the de-
scription and the drawings to interpret the claims.
Article 69 is to be interpreted according to the Protocol
on Interpretation of Article 69 of
the EPC (the
‚ÄòProtocol‚Äô). Article 1 of the Protocol states:

Article 69 should not be interpreted in the sense that the ex-
tent of the protection conferred by a European Patent is to
be understood as that deÔ¨Åned by the strict, literal meaning of
the wording used in the claims, the description and drawings
being employed only for the purpose of resolving an ambigu-
ity found in the claims. Neither should it be interpreted in
the sense that the claims serve only as a guideline and that
the actual protection conferred may extend to what, from a
consideration of the description and drawings by a person
skilled in the art, the patentee has contemplated. On the con-
trary, it is to be interpreted as deÔ¨Åning a position between
these extremes which combines a fair protection for the pat-
entee with a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties.

The Protocol requires a middle way to be found between
the two extreme approaches that it describes. These ex-
tremes are based on different philosophies: the Ô¨Årst adopts
a literal approach where the words used in the patent are
restricted to their literal meaning, as interpreted by the pat-
ent and surrounding circumstances (contextual), or alter-
natively ‚Äòthe meanings assigned to the words by a
dictionary and to the syntax by a grammar‚Äô1 (acontextual).
According to this philosophy, the words used by the patent
draftsman are intended to mark out the claims of the pat-
ent precisely. This approach provides a reasonable degree
of certainty for third parties, as required by the Protocol,
but also risks an injustice to the patentee if something he
thought he had claimed is excluded by a strict and unfor-
giving construction of the language of the claim.

The second approach is more liberal. According to
this approach, the wording of the claims is only taken
as a guideline, to be read together with the speciÔ¨Åcation
and drawings. It aims to identify the ‚Äòinventive concept‚Äô

ties in doubt as to the activities that may infringe.

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 9

A particular concern with the literal approach is that it
is
likely to exclude immaterial variants‚Äîso-called
‚Äòequivalents‚Äô.3 An equivalent is generally understood to
be a small variation to a product or process, which en-
ables it to effectively use the patented inventive concept,
without literally infringing the language of the patent
claim‚Äîthe product or process lies outside the claim,
strictly construed. To expressly address equivalents, the
Protocol was revised to add Article 24:

[. . .] for the purpose of determining the extent of protec-
tion conferred by a European patent, due account shall be
taken of any element which is equivalent to an element
speciÔ¨Åed in the claims.

How ‚Äòdue account‚Äô is given to immaterial variants in a
clear and structured way goes to the central issue of
how patent scope should be determined.

With the UniÔ¨Åed Patent Court (UPC) expected to
come into force in 2017, this article examines the ap-
proach taken to these issues in four jurisdictions experi-
enced in patent
the
Netherlands and the UK‚Äîand addresses whether there
is any common ground shared between them that
might guide the UPC on this issue.

France

General principles

Article 69 of the EPC, as amended by the EPC 2000, is
codiÔ¨Åed in French law by Article L.613-2 of
the
Intellectual Property Code. The doctrine of equivalents
is not codiÔ¨Åed but has been widely adopted and under-
stood by the courts to mean that the scope of protec-
tion of claims includes variants that have the same
function and achieve the same result as those embodi-
ments within the express language of the claim.

Whether the doctrine of equivalents applies depends
on whether the claims in question are drafted broadly to
cover general means (moyens ge¬¥ne¬¥reaux) or narrowly to
cover particular means (moyens particuliers). For the
doctrine to apply to moyens particuliers, the court must
Ô¨Årst assess the function of
that means to establish
whether it is new. If it is new, a variant that has the same
function and achieves the same result will be equivalent.
On the other hand, if the means is already known to the

For the purposes of this paper, the terms are used interchangeably.

art, the scope of protection is limited to the means pre-
sented in the claim. An example is the claim to detect
HIV with a particular DNA fragment probe, using a spe-
ciÔ¨Åc means of DNA/RNA hybridization.5 The function
of this speciÔ¨Åc means was known to the art at the prior-
ity date. It followed that the claim could not be inter-
preted as protecting other methods of hybridization that
are not claimed but achieve the same function.

Role of the prosecution Ô¨Åle

In the French approach to the scope of protection of
claims, the prosecution Ô¨Åle will form part of the general
factual context by which scope is determined. It has an
additional signiÔ¨Åcance for claims that were narrowed dur-
ing prosecution, especially when the claims were nar-
rowed in order to secure the grant of the disputed patent.
In these cases, a non-ambiguous claim with narrow scope
cannot be given a general scope through interpretation, in
particular when the patentee has been forced, in order to
distinguish the invention from the prior art, to limit the
scope of the claim in the context of the granting process.6

The UK

General principles

The speciÔ¨Åc mention of equivalents in Article 2 of the
Protocol was a source of interest in the UK because a
‚Äòdoctrine of equivalents‚Äô had never been considered
part of English law. However, even before the provision
came into force in the UK, the House of Lords held in
Kirin-Amgen that Article 69 EPC ‚Äòshuts the door on any
doctrine which extends protection outside the claims‚Äô.7
Thus, any determination of patent scope must be lim-
ited by the extent of the claims and no further8:

Although art. 69 prevents equivalence from extending pro-
tection outside the claims, there is no reason why it cannot
be an important part of the background of facts known to
the skilled man which would affect what he understood the
claims to mean. That is no more than common sense. It is
also expressly provided by the new art. 2 added to the
Protocol by the Munich Act revising the EPC [. . .]

Since Kirin-Amgen, the Court of Appeal has sought to
organize the principles laid down by the House of
Lords in a list of eleven guidelines.9 The ninth item on

Paul England  The scope of protection of patent claims in Europe and the UPC

ARTICLE

691

the list expressly states that there is no doctrine of
equivalents. However, the Court of Appeal has more re-
cently stated that the fact that English courts do not ap-
ply a general doctrine of equivalence to the const
ruction of patent claims does not mean that the exis-
tence of equivalents which have no material effect on
the way the invention works has no bearing on the
proper, purposive interpretation of a patent claim.
Instead, the court stated, it has long been the law that
such equivalents form part of the background of facts,
known to the skilled reader, which would affect what he
understands the claim to mean.10 The Court of Appeal
went on to say that English law recognizes the impact
of equivalents in the Protocol Questions,11 which at the
time had been little considered for ten years. The
Protocol Questions are as follows:

If the issue was whether a feature embodied in an alleged
infringement which fell outside the primary,
literal or
acontextual meaning of a descriptive word or phrase in the
claim (‚Äòa variant‚Äô) was nevertheless within its language as
properly interpreted, the court should ask itself the follow-
ing three questions:

1. Does the variant have a material effect upon the
way the invention works? If yes, the variant is out-
side the claim. If no?

2. Would this (ie that the variant had no material ef-
fect) have been obvious at the date of publication of
the patent to a reader skilled in the art? If no, the
variant is outside the claim. If yes?

3. Would the reader skilled in the art nevertheless
have understood from the language of the claim
that the patentee intended that strict compliance
with the primary meaning was an essential require-
ment of the invention? If yes, the variant is outside
the claim. On the other hand, a negative answer to
the last question would lead to the conclusion that
the patentee was intending the word or phrase to
have not a literal but a Ô¨Ågurative meaning (the Ô¨Åg-
ure being a form of synecdoche or metonymy)
denoting a class of things which include the variant
and the literal meaning, the latter being perhaps
the most perfect, best-known or striking example
of the class.

Therefore, while the UK courts do not recognize a doc-
trine of equivalents as such, there remains the possibil-
ity, in rare cases, that a claim may be construed to
include an immaterial variant.

Role of the prosecution Ô¨Åle

Although it is not inadmissible, the courts are skeptical
about the application of evidence from the prosecution
Ô¨Åle when determining the scope of protection of a pat-
ent. The Court of Appeal, in Actavis,12 provided two
sets of considerations that explain this scepticism:

1. using evidence from the prosecution Ô¨Åle assumes
that the skilled reader will always read the prosecu-
tion history even when it is recognized to have lim-
ited value, and

2. more importantly, cases in which the story told by
the prosecution history will assist the court in pre-
venting abuse of the system will be very rare. Unless
the acceptance of a restriction in a claim is to operate
as an estoppel against an argument for wider claims
(rejected, for example, in Bristol Myers,13 at least at
Ô¨Årst instance), there will be an issue about whether
the applicant needed to accept the restriction, regard-
less of whether they did so. This limits the light that
the prosecution history can shed on construction.

The Court of Appeal, therefore, did not regard it useful
to go to the prosecution history in order to discover
whether the patentee accepted a restriction to their
claim. It is open to the patentee to say that the apparent
concession made in prosecution was not actually neces-
sary and wrongly made. However, the court left open
the possibility that, should this argument not be open
to the patentee, then the prosecution history may have
interpretative value.

Germany

General principles

The principles developed by the Federal Supreme Court
of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof) place the claims as the
decisive basis for determining claim construction‚Äîthe
extent of protection must align with the claims.14
However, since claims must include equivalents, further
to Article 2 of the Protocol, it is not possible to provide
the optimum of certainty for third parties in the way
that would be provided by literal attention to the lan-
guage of the claims. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust
the extent of protection achieving an appropriate scope
of protection of claims. The objective person skilled in
the art must, against the background of his skills and
knowledge, determine what in his view is the scope of

protection. In simple terms, this scope extends to those
variants that, having regard to the patent claim, are ob-
vious to a person skilled in the art.15

Whether the variant is obvious is determined accord-
ing to the approach exempliÔ¨Åed by Schneidmesser I.16
This requires a positive answer to be given to each of
the following three steps (sometimes referred to as the
‚ÄòSchneidmesser Questions‚Äô)17:

1. Does the modiÔ¨Åed embodiment solve the problem
underlying the invention with means that have ob-
jectively the same technical effect?

2. Was the person skilled in the art, using his specialist
knowledge, able to Ô¨Ånd the variant at the priority
date as having the same effect?

3. Are the considerations which the skilled person
takes into account for the variant in the light of the
meaning of the invention close enough to the con-
siderations taken into account for the literal solu-
tion protected by the claims, such that the skilled
person will consider the variant as a solution which
is equal/equivalent to the literal one.18

For those rare cases in which a positive answer to the Ô¨Årst
three questions extends the scope of protection to a vari-
ant which is obvious or lacks novelty with regard to the
prior art, a fourth question (the ‚ÄòFormstein19 objection‚Äô) is
applied‚Äîthis must be answered in the negative in order
to guard against over-extending the scope of the claim:

inventive step is necessary to Ô¨Ånd the modiÔ¨Åed means as
having the same effect.21

The German courts have placed limitations on the doc-
trine of equivalents. The Bundesgerichtshof, in Okklu
sionsvorrichtung/‚Äòocclusion device‚Äô22 and in Diglycidve
rbindung/‚Äòdiglycidyl compounds‚Äô,23 strengthened the ap-
plicant‚Äôs responsibility to clearly formulate the patent
claims and deÔ¨Åned tighter requirements for patent
infringement under the doctrine of equivalence.
In
particular, the Bundesgerichtshof pointed out that, in
case of contradictions between the claim language and
the patent description, in particular where the claim
language speciÔ¨Åcally selects only one embodiment out of
several embodiments described in the patent speciÔ¨Åca-
tion, the person skilled in the art will consider this
selection when assessing equivalence under Schneid
messer Question 3. Hence, whilst Germany is considered
to have a doctrine of equivalence, it is a restricted one.
However, the above approach should be contrasted with
the Federal Supreme Court in the pemetrexed case (*Eli
Lilly v Actavis, 14 June 2016) where it was not apparent
on the facts that a speciÔ¨Åc selection had been made.

Role of the prosecution Ô¨Åle

In Germany, it is not permitted to use the prosecution Ô¨Åle
as a means to construe the scope of protection of claims.

4. Does the variant, having regard to the state of the art,
lack novelty or is the variant obvious to a person
skilled in the art?

The Netherlands

General principles

It has been noted that the Schneidmesser Questions re-
semble the UK Protocol Questions,20 in particular as re-
gards the similarity of the second step to the second
Protocol Question:

[. . .] at least if we understand the word ‚Äòobvious‚Äô in the
Improver test as we understand it in Art. 56 EPC, i.e.
meaning that no inventive step is needed. For, just like ap-
plying Art. 56, we have to exclude those cases where an

Historically, in the Netherlands, the scope of claims was
determined following the approach set out by the
Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) in Philips v Tasseron.24
Here, the Hoge Raad held that the scope of protection
of a patent must be based on the ‚Äòessence of the inven-
tion‚Äô (‚Äòhet wezen van de vitvinding‚Äô). This approach al-
lowed the scope of protection of a claim to be broader
than the wording of the claim itself. The effect was to

Indeed, the decision ‚ÄòSchneidmesser l‚Äô is only one of a series of
Bundesgerichtshof decisions that were delivered at the same time and that
identically phrased the questions. The decisions are ‚ÄòKunststoffrohrteil‚Äô
(GRUR 2002, 511), ‚ÄòSchneidmesser l‚Äô (GRUR 2002, 515), ‚ÄòSchneidmesser
ll‚Äô (GRUR 2002, 519), ‚ÄòCustodiol l‚Äô (GRUR 2002, 523) and ‚ÄòCustodiol ll‚Äô
(GRUR 2002, 527). ‚ÄòSchneidmesser l‚Äô is usually (inter alia by judges P.
Meier-Beck and K. Grabinski) regarded as the lead decision.

German court was to some extent inÔ¨Çuenced by the English cases of
Catnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith Ltd [1981] FSR 60 and Improver
Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181, and
was consciously making a step towards an approach concerned as much
with claim language as with pure inventive concept.

make it difÔ¨Åcult for third parties to rely on the wording
of the claims to know whether they were working
within their scope of protection and therefore infring-
ing. Despite the introduction of the EPC and Article 69
and the Protocol, the Dutch courts remained reluctant
to move away from placing the essence of the invention
at the heart of their method of assessing the scope of
protection.25 This changed, only to a limited extent, in
Ciba-Geigy vs Ote¬¥ Optics,26 in which the Hoge Raad
shifted its emphasis from the essence of the invention
to the ‚Äòinventive concept behind the wording of the
claims‚Äô (‚Äòde achter de woorden van de conclusies lig-
gende uitvindingsgedachte‚Äô Four factors, according to
the Hoge Raad, must be used to assess the scope of
protection:

1.

2.

3.

in interpreting the terms of the claims, the court is
to determine the essence of the invention; in other
words, consider the inventive concept behind the
wording of the claims;

this interpretation then needs to be corrected to
give a reasonable degree of certainty for third par-
ties, which may sometimes justify a restricted, literal
interpretation of the wording of the claims;

the skilled person may‚Äîwith restraint‚Äîuse the
prosecution history Ô¨Åle for the purpose of claim
interpretation;

4. all other circumstances of the case are to be taken
into account, including the possible breakthrough
nature of the invention (justifying a broader scope).
When considering factors 2 and 3, poor drafting of
the patent may be construed to the patentee‚Äôs
disadvantage.27

This continues to be the approach of the Hoge Raad,
although the court has more recently clariÔ¨Åed that the
essence of the invention is a ‚Äòviewpoint‚Äô, rather than
the ‚Äòstarting point‚Äô by which scope of claims must be
determined.28 However, the decision in Medinol29 dem-
onstrates that this viewpoint may nonetheless be the
dominant
factor in the assessment. The essence of
the invention, in the Medinol case, was the solution to
the problem that out-of-phase stents shorten when ex-
panded, which was not perceived as a problem for in-
phase stents at the priority date. Therefore, the Hoge
Raad held that
the in-phase variant could not be

included within the scope of the claim. The District
Court of The Hague (Rechtbank den Haag) has since
explained the Hoge Raad‚Äôs reasoning in Medinol as
follows:

[T]he scope of protection of a European patent is estab-
lished on the basis of the skilled person‚Äôs perspective on
the Ô¨Årst [priority/Ô¨Åling] date in view of [. . .] aforemen-
tioned principles (also named the contextual interpreta-
tion). Equivalents already known at that moment will be
involved in this interpretation. The question to be an-
swered thereafter, whether a product or method should be
considered infringing, takes, in principle, place on the basis
of the scope of protection on the Ô¨Årst date, as established
by the contextual interpretation. The possibility of addi-
tional protection by equivalence will be limited, as equiva-
lents known to the skilled person have already been
involved in the contextual interpretation on the Ô¨Årst date
Such a possibility only seems to exist in case of equivalents
which were not foreseeable at the Ô¨Årst date, which can then
be involved in the infringement question and, if appropri-
ate, brought within the scope of protection.30

In practice, however, the lower courts have tended to-
wards an approach that distinguishes literal infringe-
ment from non-literal infringement by equivalents.31
To assess non-literal infringement, the courts use the
‚Äòfunction-way/means-result‚Äô test32‚Äîdoes the non-literal
variant fulÔ¨Ål the same function as the patented one, by
using similar means, leading to a similar result, or the
insubstantial differences test (more easily applied to
chemical
cases), which assesses
whether the differences between the allegedly infringing
article or process and the claim are material.33 In apply-
ing these tests, the courts take care that any protection
outside the literal wording of the claims does not go
outside the invention (and as such the approach re-
mains in line with the Hoge Raad case law). However,
concerns about providing certainty for third parties
have persisted and it has become rarer to see cases in
which infringement is held on the basis of equivalence.

other things, the prosecution Ô¨Åle.34 However, reason-
able doubt must exist as to what the claims cover.35
While a defendant may rely on the prosecution Ô¨Åle in
respect of scope of protection, the Dutch courts will
only accept with reluctance arguments that are in fa-
vour of the patentee based on the prosecution Ô¨Åle.

Case comparisons

The decisions of national courts in parallel actions al-
low some practical comparison between the approaches
they take to the scope of claims, subject to evidential
and other procedural differences. Two sets of parallel
decisions from recent years are those in the litigation
between Occlutech and AGA Medical concerning stent
devices, and between Actavis and Eli Lilly concerning a
combination therapy for tumour growth inhibition that
includes pemetrexed disodium.

The Occlutech stent cases

In the parallel actions involving Occlutech and AGA
Medical Corporation, the Dutch, German and English
courts had to decide whether Occlutech‚Äôs stent device
for the occlusion of blood vessels and other body lu-
mens infringed a patent owned by AGA Medical. The
patented device used a metal fabric formed of braided
metal strands, clamped at opposite ends of the device.
Occlutech‚Äôs device was also made from metal wire, but
differed in that the metal strands were welded together
at only one end.

Central to the infringement analysis in the English
Patents Court36 was the construction of the words
‚Äòclamps‚Äô and ‚Äòthe strands at the opposite ends of the de-
vice‚Äô. The Court of Appeal37 reviewed the authorities
and reiterated that, while a patent speciÔ¨Åcation operates
as a contextual aid to construction, it is not necessarily
determinative of the scope of the claims on its own.
In particular, the court considered whether Occlutech
devices achieved the same effect as the patented devices
by equivalent means, so far as permitted by Kirin-
Amgen.38 The court held that there was no infringe-
ment, on the basis that the skilled person would under-
stand the clamp‚Äînot welding‚Äîto be the primary and
effective means of securing the strands of metal at their
ends. It was also held that the words ‚Äòopposite‚Äô and
‚Äòclamps‚Äô would be understood as meaning that the

device must be clamped at both opposite ends, not just
one of them.

In the Dutch case, the doctrine of equivalence was
also employed to argue that the means used to secure
the meshes in both devices is equivalent. However, the
Rechtbank den Haag, followed by the Court of Appeal
of The Hague (Gerechtshof den Haag), held, like the
English Patents Court, that the requirement that the de-
vices be clamped at both ends was an essential element
of the claim and that this could not be interpreted
more broadly.

In the German case, the Du¬®sseldorf Oberlandsger-
icht came to the opposite view.39 Relying on a state-
ment from the speciÔ¨Åcation, it held that there was
infringement, because the skilled addressee would un-
derstand that the function of the clamp was to hold
together the ends of the metal strands, and that doing
so at only one end fell within the embodiments of the
invention. On appeal to the Bundesgerichtshof, the de-
cision was overturned.40 The upper court found that
there was neither literal infringement nor infringement
by equivalence. The Bundesgerichtshof held that the
patent description is admissible as a guide to construc-
tion only in so far as it explains the claimed subject
matter. The description must not be used to correct
the language of the claim, for instances where there is
an inconsistency between the claim and the descrip-
tion, infringing equivalent solutions must be based on
the claim.

The pemetrexed cases

The UK patent
Actavis sought declarations that its proposed peme-
trexed diacid, pemetrexed dipotassium and pemetrexed
ditromethamine products would not infringe Lilly‚Äôs
European patent EP 1 313 508 (the ‚Äò"‚Äô508 Patent‚Äô),
which essentially claims the use of pemetrexed diso-
dium in combination with vitamin B12 and, optionally,
folic acid, for inhibiting tumour growth. The focus of
the case was on the meaning of
the expression
‚Äòpemetrexed disodium‚Äô‚Äîdoes the scope of the claim
extend to pemetrexed dipotassium, pemetrexed diacid
or pemetrexed ditromethamine?

In the English Patents Court,41 there was no dispute
that pemetrexed diacid is not pemetrexed disodium

The Ô¨Ånding of non-infringement by Arnold J in respect of the UK patent

the drug in question was accompanied by instructions to reconstitute in
saline (sodium chloride), thus forming pemetrexed disodium in solution.

according to its ‚Äòprimary, literal or acontextual mean-
ing‚Äô. The court used the Protocol Questions42 to deter-
mine whether the alternative pemetrexed compounds
could be deemed to be variants of
the potassium
compound.

As regards the Ô¨Årst Protocol Question, the parties ac-
cepted that the difference between pemetrexed diacid,
dipotassium and ditromethamine on one hand, and
disodium, on the other, had no material effect. This
is because from the point of view of the skilled oncolo-
gist, the active anti-cancer principle in an aqueous solu-
tion of pemetrexed disodium for intravenous admin
istration is the pemetrexed anion, the source of which
is immaterial. From the perspective of a chemist, peme-
trexed diacid, dipotassium and ditromethamine are all
pharmaceutically acceptable and sufÔ¨Åciently soluble.

Resolving the second Protocol Question depended
on the meaning of ‚Äòthe way in which the invention
works‚Äô, and the level of generality at which that is as-
sessed. The problem is the same, the judge commented,
if one asks whether the variant solves the problem un-
derlying the invention by means that have the same
technical effect. From the oncologist‚Äôs perspective, it
would be obvious that, provided the diacid yielded a
sufÔ¨Åcient concentration of pemetrexed anions in solu-
tion and did not introduce side effects, using the diacid
would have no material effect on the invention.
However, the evidence of the skilled chemist was that it
did not know if there was no material effect until the al-
ternative compound was tested. The chemist would not
be conÔ¨Ådent of success before testing (in particular be-
cause of the potential toxicity of potassium given the
quantities of pemetrexed required). This was far from
the level of conÔ¨Ådence required for an afÔ¨Årmative an-
swer to the second Protocol Question.

As regards the third Protocol Question, it was neces-
sary to consider overall which construction of the ex-
pression ‚Äòpemetrexed disodium‚Äô combined fair prote
ction for the patentee and reasonable certainty for third
parties under the Protocol. On this, there was nothing

the

the

skilled team to suggest

in the speciÔ¨Åcation or the common general knowledge
of
expression
‚Äòpemetrexed disodium‚Äô meant anything other than its
conventional sense.43 The court held that the claim was
limited to the use of pemetrexed. This would provide
fair protection, without the risk of the ‚Äô508 Patent being
invalidated on the grounds of added matter and/or in-
sufÔ¨Åciency. Construing the claim as extending to (at
least) any form of pemetrexed which is pharmaceuti-
cally acceptable and sufÔ¨Åciently soluble would not pro-
vide a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties.
Any other conclusion would fail to give effect to the
Protocol and would be tantamount to treating the
claims as a mere guideline.

The French patent
The pemetrexed case is unusual in that the issue of
non-infringement of the French part of the ‚Äô508 Patent
was also decided by Arnold J in the English Patents
Court. It is common ground in respect of the French
validation that none of pemetrexed diacid, dipotassium
and ditromethamine were within the scope of
the
claims of the patent on a literal interpretation. The issue
was again whether, according to the French approach,
these compounds were within the scope of the claims
when applying the doctrine of equivalents. In Arnold J‚Äôs
judgment,
they were not. This was for two main
reasons:

(i) the doctrine of equivalents does not apply in a case
of this kind, because pemetrexed disodium is a
moyen particulier. The judge found that the func-
tion of pemetrexed disodium in inhibiting tumour
growth was already known at the date of the pat-
ent. Therefore, the expression ‚Äòpemetrexed diso-
dium‚Äô must be interpreted as being limited to the
particular compound speciÔ¨Åed by that expression;

(ii) the prosecution history showed that the claims
were deliberately limited to pemetrexed disodium
in order to secure grant. In those circumstances,

This decision does not challenge the approach to determining scope of
claim using the Protocol Questions adopted by the judge. At the time of
writing, the case was subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.

42 The judge makes the observation that patentees resort to arguments

about equivalents in three main classes of case: i) where, with the beneÔ¨Åt
of hindsight, it can be seen that the patent was unfortunately drafted,
whether because of poor instructions from the inventor or poor drafting
by his patent attorney or a combination of these things. The law recog-
nizes that drafting patent claims is a difÔ¨Åcult and imprecise art and that
third parties should not be allowed to exploit infelicities of drafting
where it is reasonably clear that those infelicities should not affect the
scope of the claim. This is in order to provide ‚Äòfair protection for the pat-
ent proprietor‚Äô. However, the law also recognizes that there must be ‚Äòa
reasonable degree of legal certainty for third parties‚Äô. The courts have to
strike a balance in this regard; ii) where technology has moved on since

the priority or Ô¨Åling date of the patent, the law is sympathetic to the
proposition that third parties should not be able to avoid infringement
merely by employing new technical means to implement the invention.
However, the drafting of a claim may be inescapably tied to the old tech-
nology; and iii) where the patentee now regrets a decision taken during
the course of prosecution of the patent application, whether by himself
or by the examiner, and is trying to avoid the consequences of that deci-
sion. There is no reason why the law should be sympathetic to the paten-
tee. Not only do applicants generally rely on skilled professional advice,
but also they can appeal against adverse decisions of examiners during
the course of prosecution if they consider that those decisions are wrong.
In this respect the judge was inÔ¨Çuenced by the prosecution history show-
ing that the claims had been deliberately limited to pemetrexed diso-
dium, although the Court of Appeal has since doubted whether such
reliance on the prosecution Ô¨Åle is permissible; see Actavis (n 10).

The German patent
Lilly brought proceedings against Actavis for threatened
infringement of the German designation of the patent
in question before the Du¬®sseldorf Regional Court
(Landgericht).44 Again, assessing whether pemetrexed
dipotassium would fall within claims to the use of the
disodium compound, the court Ô¨Årst considered literal
infringement. Neither the patent claim nor the patent
description provided an indication to the skilled person
that the term pemetrexed disodium encompassed the
use of other pemetrexed compounds and so there could
be no literal infringement.

As regards equivalent infringement, the court used
the approach in Schneidermesser. In the Ô¨Årst step, the
court held at Ô¨Årst instance that the use of pemetrexed
dipotassium in the context of the combination therapy
together with vitamin B12 has the same effect as the use
of pemetrexed disodium‚Äîit solves the problem of the
patent with modiÔ¨Åed, but objectively equal-acting,
means. Differing
the
Landgericht held, in the second step, that the skilled
person would be able to Ô¨Ånd, without any inventive ef-
fort,
that pemetrexed dipotassium is an alternative
equal-acting means for pemetrexed disodium.

from the English court,

Under the third step, the court came to the conclu-
sion that an equivalent infringement could not be ruled
out merely because the ‚Äô508 Patent speciÔ¨Åcation only
explicitly identiÔ¨Åes pemetrexed disodium, but not other
pemetrexed derivatives, in particular pemetrexed dipo-
tassium; the skilled person would think that the substi-
tution of pemetrexed disodium with pemetrexed
dipotassium complies with the meaning of the teaching
of the patent and that pemetrexed dipotassium thus
constitutes an equal solution.

The Ô¨Ånding of non-infringement at Ô¨Årst instance was
overturned by
the Du¬®sseldorf Court of Appeal
(Oberlandesgericht).45 This court emphasized that it
does not sufÔ¨Åce for the person skilled in the art to rec-
ognize a teaching as having technically equivalent effect
to the teaching formulated in the claims, based on his
expert knowledge. Instead, his assessment must focus
on the claim‚Äî‚Äòorientation on the claim‚Äô. This requires
that the claim not only forms the starting point in all
its characteristics, but also the decisive basis for the
considerations of the person skilled in the art. The Ô¨Årst
instance court had not considered that the patent in its

taken seriously,

entirety suggests to the skilled person that the applicant
had consciously decided in favour of the use of peme-
trexed disodium. If the technical teaching of the claim
is
there is no equivalent way of
substituting the pemetrexed disodium taught with
pemetrexed dipotassium, despite the fact that the in-
vention could be successfully realized with either. In
turn, the Federal Supreme Court has now overturned
the Court of Appeal on the basis that because peme-
trexed disodium is the only speciÔ¨Åc embodiment in the
description, it cannot be said to have been deliberately
selected in the claim. In the light of this, the case has
been referred back to the Court of Appeal
for re-
examination.

Common ground for the UPC?

What common ground can the UPC judges draw from
these national approaches to determining the scope of
protection of the claims, to assist them when develop-
ing their own application of the Protocol?

suggests

Although parallel cases can be found in which the
Dutch, French, German and UK courts have come to
different decisions, the unanimous Ô¨Ånding that there
was no infringement in the Occlutech and pemetrexed
cases
taken in these
jurisdictions are not far apart (currently subject to re-
examination by the German appeal court). This can be
seen by looking at the common principles that the sys-
tems share in their approaches to Article 69 and the
Protocol.

The Hoge Raad test in Ciba-Geigy, whilst focused on
the inventive concept itself, shares the characteristic of
the English, French and German tests, as it allows deter-
mination of whether a third-party product or process is
a variant of those within the scope of the claim. The
Hoge Raad has been content to accept the use by the
lower courts of function-way/means-result and insub-
stantial difference tests. This approach has the effect of
deÔ¨Åning the invention as a collection of variants with
the
in common.
Similarly, in France, the underlying question is whether
variants have the same function and achieve the same
result as those claimed, with the exception that varia-
tions of means that were known at the priority date are
not covered by the claim. In Germany, the Formstein
objection ensures that variants that lack novelty or are
obvious to a person skilled in the art are not included
within the scope of protection of the patent. In the
Netherlands, a variant can be included within the scope

Paul England  The scope of protection of patent claims in Europe and the UPC

ARTICLE

697

of the claim only if it solves a problem that was known
at the priority date of the patent.

The English and German tests are more complex in
presentation, but at their heart there is the same analy-
sis. In Germany, the question is: does the modiÔ¨Åed em-
bodiment solve the problem underlying the invention
with means that have objectively the same technical ef-
fect? This approach is concerned with the variant pro-
ducing the same result, using basically similar means.
In the UK, under the Protocol Questions, the question
asked‚Äîdoes the variant have a material effect upon the
way the invention works?‚Äîsimilarly links the variants
to a common technical result.

Concern remains in the UK that the Kirin-Amgen
approach is too unforgiving for patentees, as they can-
not be expected to predict what future technological de-
velopments might be made, and should not pay the
penalty for slips by the claims draftsman.46 By contrast,
the courts in many European jurisdictions have recog-
nized the fallibility of patentees and have come to their
aid when it is thought that defendants have taken the
essence of the invention even if they have avoided the
wording of the claims. Most European courts and ex-
perts agree that the scope of patent protection may, in
some cases, be extended beyond the claims to equiva-
lent solutions of the technical problem underlying the
invention.

Some form of extension of the scope of protection is
consistent not only with the wording of the legislation
but also with the history of the negotiations that led to
Article 69 EPC and the Protocol. However, in practice,
despite the above recognition of a doctrine of equiva-
lents, many courts have to a large degree moved towards

an approach that places the claim language at the centre
of the infringement analysis and in which the applica-
tion of the doctrine of equivalents is something of a last
resort to avoid an inequitable result. As the pemetrexed
cases illustrate, the Ô¨Ånding that a variant that lies out-
side the literal scope of a claim is nonetheless protected
under the doctrine of equivalents, will be relatively rare
in the national courts. The UPC, in which many of the
judges will be drawn from the same national courts,
might be expected to follow a similar approach.

An open question, at present, is the extent, if any, to
which the UPC will be willing to take the prosecution
Ô¨Åle into consideration when determining the scope of
the claims. In a system that commonly uses the doctrine
of equivalents, use of the prosecution Ô¨Åle can be impor-
tant to prevent the unfair situation where a claim is
construed to cover an embodiment that was deliberately
excluded in prosecution. It might be expected that the
prosecution Ô¨Åle should feature less when the doctrine
of equivalents is relied on rarely, although there is no
clear relationship between the two in the countries de-
scribed above: Germany, which can employ the doc-
trine of equivalents, does not rely on the prosecution
Ô¨Åle at all; France and the Netherlands appear more will-
ing to take the prosecution Ô¨Åle into consideration. In
the UPC, it will take some time for the court to settle
on the correct role of the prosecution Ô¨Åle, and in the
meantime decisions will be inÔ¨Çuenced by the national
experience of the judges concerned. However, where it
is relevant, parties can be expected to try to introduce
the prosecution Ô¨Åle into cases when asking the court to
make decisions about the scope of patent claims.
