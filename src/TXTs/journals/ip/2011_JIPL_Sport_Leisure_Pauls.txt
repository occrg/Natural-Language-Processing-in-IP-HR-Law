(a) Are there any limitations on the admissibility of evi-

dence in section 145 proceedings? In particular –

(i) Does

the Administrative Procedure Act

require
review on the agency record in proceedings pursuant
to section 145?

(ii) Does section 145 provide for a de novo proceeding

in the district court?

(iii) If section 145 does not provide for a de novo proceed-
ing in the district court, what limitations exist on the
presentation of new evidence before the district court?

(b) Did the district court properly exclude the Hyatt

declaration?

Id. at *14. With input from a half dozen amici curae, the
full Court considered these questions.

Analysis
In Hyatt v Kappos, No. 2007-1006, 2010 US App. LEXIS
23117 (Fed. Cir. 8 Nov. 2010) the Federal Circuit, sitting
en banc, found that the district court applied the wrong
legal standard for admissibility of evidence in a civil
action brought under Section 145 and abused its discre-
tion in excluding Mr Hyatt’s declaration.

The Court held that the only limitations on the admis-
sibility of evidence in a Section 145 proceeding are those
limitations applicable to all civil actions imposed by the
Federal Rules of Evidence and Federal Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure. In reaching this decision, the Court focused on
the language of the statute and the legislative history of
Section 145 to determine that the intent of Congress was
to allow applicants to introduce new evidence in civil
actions brought under Section 145. Speciﬁcally, the Court
found that the language of Section 145 does not provide
any ‘unique rules of evidence’ and further,
‘this civil
action does not merely afford judicial review of agency
action. Rather, the statute directs that the district court
may “adjudge that such applicant is entitled to receive a
patent for his invention . . . as the facts in the case may
appear.” ’ Id. at *18.

The Court also rejected the Director’s argument that an
applicant may only ‘introduce new evidence that “the
applicant could not reasonably have provided to the
agency in the ﬁrst instance.” ’ Id. at *32. The Court found
that the Director’s reliance on Morgan v Daniels, 153 US
120 (1894) was misplaced since Morgan does not address
the admissibility of new evidence. Instead,
the Court
relied on US Supreme Court precedent that has ‘consist-
ently recognized that new evidence may be introduced in
these district court proceedings.’ Id. at *37.

The Federal Circuit emphasized that this rule is consist-
ent with the district court’s right to consider the Patent
Ofﬁce proceedings in determining what weight to afford
the applicant’s newly admitted evidence. The Court clari-

ﬁed that where no new evidence is admitted in a Section
145 proceeding, the district court must review the case on
the same record presented to the agency and must apply
the Administrative Procedure Act’s substantial evidence
standard to the Patent Ofﬁce’s fact ﬁndings. However,
when new evidence is introduced, the district court ‘must
make de novo fact ﬁndings with respect to factual issues
to which the new evidence relates.’ Id. at *47.

Ultimately, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment of
the district court, holding that it was an abuse of discre-
tion to exclude Mr Hyatt’s declaration, and remanded for
further proceedings.

Judge Dyk, dissenting, cautioned that

the majority
opinion ‘denigrates the important expertise of the PTO’
and ‘invites applicants to deliberately withhold evidence
from the PTO in favor of a more hospitable district court
forum.’ Id. at *65.

Practical signiﬁcance
Hyatt forced the Court to weigh the risk of applicants
deliberately withholding evidence from the PTO in favour
of a more hospitable district court forum (at the heavy
expense of delay and loss of potentially important patent
term), against the risk that the PTO would be over-
whelmed with an onslaught of evidence on potentially
non-controversial points of fact. Time will tell whether
the balance reached by the majority of
is
correct. In light of these broader evidentiary consider-
ations, more dissatisﬁed applicants may turn to the Dis-
trict Court to redress an adverse decision of the Board,
rather than go straight to the Federal Circuit.

Australian golfer, Greg Norman, notwithstanding that
the merchandise bearing those marks had been manu-
factured by and purchased from an authorised licensee.

Legal context
Sporte Leisure considers,
in circumstances of parallel
importing, the application of section 123(1) of the Trade
Marks Act 1995 (Cth), which provides a defence to a
claim of trade mark infringement made under section 120
on the grounds that the mark has been applied to, or in
relation to, goods, by or with the consent of the mark’s
registered owner.

Facts
Great White (the second applicant) owned two registered
trade marks in respect of apparel, footwear and headwear,
for the words ‘Greg Norman’ and a device in the form of
a stylised depiction of a shark, respectively. Under an
agreement between head licensor Greg Norman Collec-
tion, Inc (GNC) and BTB Marketing PVT Ltd, BTB was
licensed to use the trade marks in connection with the
manufacture and sale of ‘licensed products’ in the Union
of
India. BTB was, however, prohibited from selling
licensed products outside the Union of India without
GNC’s prior written approval.

On or about 18 August 2008, Paul’s Retail placed a pur-
chase order for ‘Greg Norman’ garments with Singapore-
based PT International Corporation Pte Ltd. The evidence
established that the managing director of PT International
informed the sole director of Paul’s Retail, Mr Paul
Dwyer, that the garments to be supplied were genuine
goods manufactured by licensed manufacturer, BTB. Paki-
stan-based Sunsports (BVI) Limited, which was afﬁliated
with PT International, then issued a ‘Purchase Order’ to
BTB. Importantly, BTB notiﬁed Sunsports that the gar-
ments would only be manufactured after a letter of credit
was established. BTB manufactured the garments after the
letter was established, and the associated shipping and
invoice documentation indicated that the garments would
be shipped to Sunsports from India to Pakistan via Singa-
pore. However, upon their arrival in Singapore, Sunsports
sold the garments to PT International. The evidence
established that in February or March 2009, PT Inter-
national shipped the garments to Sydney, where they were
acquired and subsequently offered for sale by Paul’s
Retail.

exposing for sale, the garments bearing the marks (section
120) ([2010] FCA 1162 at [91] – [92]).

The evidence established that, before BTB received the
Purchase Order, Mr Rahul Singh, the managing director
of BTB, was aware that Sunsports might acquire the gar-
ments from BTB for supply to, but not outside, the Paki-
stan market. The Court also concluded that BTB was
unauthorised to manufacture the garments for sale to
Pakistan under the licence agreement, notwithstanding
that subsequent correspondence from Mr Singh to GNC
indicated both that BTB considered itself a distributor of
products in ‘the Indian sub continent’ and that BTB had
been supplying Greg Norman products to Sunsports in
Pakistan. The Court accepted that GNC informed Mr
Singh that BTB needed to submit a business plan for
GNC’s approval in order to service markets outside India,
and that the royalty reports submitted by BTB under the
licence agreement did not account for the products sup-
plied to Sunsports.

As a defence to the alleged trade mark infringement,
Paul’s Retail contended that BTB manufactured and
applied the trade marks to the garments shipped to Sun-
sports with GNC’s consent (section 123(1)). In conclud-
ing that Paul’s Retail’s defence did not succeed, Nicholas J
stated ([2010] FCA 1162 at [78]):

[w]here a registered owner consents to another person
applying the registered mark to goods on condition that
the goods must not to (sic) be supplied outside a desig-
nated territory, the registered owner would not usually be
regarded as having consented to the application of the
mark to goods which the other person knows at the time
he or she applies the mark are to be supplied by him or
her outside the territory.

The Court emphasized that the garments supplied by BTB
to Sunsports were speciﬁcally manufactured by BTB for
supply outside India, which was prohibited by the terms
of the licence agreement. Further, in obiter dictum, not-
withstanding that his Honour found that BTB did not
pay royalties in respect of the garments shipped to Sun-
sports, his Honour was ([2010] FCA 1162 at [89]):

. . . not . . . prepared to infer that products manufactured by
BTB in respect of which GNC had received royalty pay-
ments were products to which the second applicant’s
marks had been applied without the second applicant’s
consent in the absence of convincing evidence to that
effect.

Analysis
Infringement by Paul’s Retail
Justice Nicholas held that Paul’s Retail (among other
respondents) infringed Great White’s
registered trade
marks by importing, distributing and/or offering or

Burden of proof of consent
Obiter, the Court rejected Paul’s Retail’s submission that
the burden was on Great White to demonstrate that the
trade marks had been applied to the garments without its
consent (section 123(1)). Justice Nicholas considered that,
as a matter of construction, because section 123 creates

an exception to infringement, the person invoking the
defence bears the burden of proof. However, in certain
circumstances, it may take little for the burden to shift to
the registered owner.

Further, contrary to Paul’s Retail’s submission, Great
White was not also required to establish that Paul’s Retail
had engaged in ‘infringing use’ in relation to the trade
marks.

Liability of joint tortfeasor
The Court rejected the applicants’ submission that Mr
Dwyer was involved in the trade mark infringements and
therefore liable for those infringements as a joint tortfea-
sor. Mr Dwyer’s ‘close’ involvement in the infringement
was in his capacity as Paul’s Retail’s executive director,
and the Court was satisﬁed that, as stated above, he genu-
inely believed the garments were ‘genuine goods’.

In considering the competing tests in Performing Right
Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd [1924] 1 KB 1
and Mentmore Manufacturing Co Ltd
v National
Merchandising Manufacturing Co Inc (1978) 89 DLR (3d)
195 concerning the liability of a director as a joint
tortfeasor, Nicholas J concluded that, for the director to
be liable, more than a ﬁnding that the director caused or
directed the company to perform infringing acts
is
required. In the Court’s view, the extent of a director’s
personal
involvement and his or her state of mind is
important, and whether the director held an honest belief
that the acts which he or she directed or procured were
not unlawful is also a signiﬁcant (and in this case, the
decisive) consideration.

Practical signiﬁcance
The facts of Sporte Leisure may support the conclusion
only that a registered owner of a trade mark would not
usually be regarded as having consented to the application
of its mark to goods where the licensee knows when the
marks are applied that the goods will be supplied outside
the designated territory. Importantly, BTB only manufac-
tured the infringing garments after Paul’s Retail placed the
order and the relevant letter of credit was established, and
BTB did not pay royalties in respect of those garments. It
is doubtful that the Court would have reached the same
conclusion if BTB was instead unaware of the destination
of the garments or if it ﬁlled the order from an existing
stockpile of merchandise.

Further, while the decision conﬁrms that the burden of
proof to demonstrate that a trade mark has been applied
to goods with the owner’s consent rests on the party
relying on the defence in section 123(1), the burden of
proof may shift to the owner, for example, as Nicholas J
noted, where the owner is best placed to know whether
the mark has been applied with its consent.

Sporte Leisure also demonstrates the increased difﬁculty
that an owner may face in proving that a director of a
company is liable for trade mark infringement as a joint
tortfeasor, where the director has merely caused or
directed the company to perform the infringing acts in
the normal course of business and honestly believes the
relevant goods are genuine.

interest confusion recognized by

Och-Ziff Management Europe Ltd and Anor v Och Capital
LLP & Ors [2010] EWHC 2599 (Ch), 20 October 2010
Confusion prior to sale of services or goods has been
recently accepted by the High Court of England and
Wales as actionable in passing off and trade mark
infringement, materially expanding the scope of these
causes of action in English law.

Legal context
Under Article 9(1)(b) of the Community Trade Mark
Regulation (207/2009/EC) (CTMR), holders of a Commu-
nity trade mark (CTM) can prevent others from using a
similar sign for similar goods or services to those for
which the CTM is registered and which causes a likeli-
hood of confusion among the relevant public. The CTMR
also provides for infringement to be established under
Article 9(1)(a) where a sign identical to a CTM is used
for identical goods, and under Article 9(1)(c) which pro-
vides for owners of CTMs with a reputation to prevent
use of a similar sign for any goods or services where such
use without due cause among other things is detrimental
to the distinctive character or the repute of the CTM.
There are various defences to infringement,
including
under Article 12(a) where a defendant uses its own name
or
commercial
practices.

in accordance with honest

address

Further, under the English law tort of passing off, good-
will can be protected where the following three elements
are established (Reckitt & Colman v Borden [1990] 1 WLR
491, 499):

(i) Goodwill: the claimant must establish that he has
goodwill in the market in respect of his goods and
services and that he has established that goodwill
through the use of distinguishing feature(s).
