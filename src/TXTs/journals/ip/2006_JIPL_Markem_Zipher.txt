Markem v Zipher‚Äîthe Court of Appeal provides
guidance on entitlement proceedings
Beatriz San Martin and David Knight*

1. Introduction
In March 2005 the Court of Appeal handed down its
judgment in Markem v Zipher1 on patent entitlement
(Figure 1). The judgment, delivered by Jacob LJ, was
approved in full by Mummery LJ and Kennedy LJ.
This important judgment both provides guidance on
the application of the entitlement provisions in the
Patents Act 1977 and also reviews and applies the
rule in Browne v Dunn2 on procedural fairness where
the reliability of witnesses is questioned, while apply-
ing the Henderson v Henderson3 principles on abuse
of process.

2. The facts
The claimants (Markem), a US company and its
wholly-owned UK subsidiary, were both engaged in
manufacturing printing and marking machines for
use in industry. The defendants consisted of Zipher
Limited, a company set up in March 2000 primarily
to develop new printers (Zipher), and four personal
defendants who previously worked for Markem but
had left at various dates during 1999 to 2000 to work
for Zipher.

Markem brought a patent entitlement action
against Zipher involving six different patents and
applications Ô¨Åled by Zipher: three patents related to
thermal transfer printing and the other three related
to inkjet printing. The basis of Markem‚Äôs claim was
that the inventions had been devised during the per-
iod when Zipher‚Äôs employees had been employed by
Markem.

The printers developed by Zipher were to be used
to place information on packaging rapidly running
on production lines (for example, bar codes and

Key issues
 A relatively routine dispute between the former
and current employers of a team of inventors
as to which is entitled to two groups of patents
took an unusual turn after the former employer
proved reluctant to argue any wrongdoing on
the part of his former employees.

 Following the trial, issues were raised relating to
the credibility of witnesses and abuse of process
through the subsequent litigation of ‚Äòstored‚Äô
issues. The Court of Appeal decided to substi-
tute its own opinion of the evidence for that
of the trial judge.

 This article maps the many strands of this ulti-
mately complex piece of litigation, which the
House of Lords has refused to review, touching
upon both the substantive issues that the Court
of Appeal has clarified as well as procedural
uncertainties that still await clarification.

‚Äòbest before‚Äô dates). At Ô¨Årst instance4 Judge Fysh ruled
in favour of Zipher in respect of the inkjet patents
and the appeal by Zipher only concerned the thermal
printer patents. These printers used a ribbon that
carried ink and printed by the application of heat
(thermal printing). The printers used a print-head
consisting of many heatable heads. The print-head
was in contact with the ribbon, which was, in turn,
in contact with the packaging. When the small heat-
able heads were heated, they transferred a dot of ink
from the ribbon to the packaging. The small heatable
heads could be activated selectively to print
the
desired information on the packaging.

Figure 1. Determining patent entitlement.

3. Entitlement proceedings
Can an entitlement under section 7
Patents Act 1977 give rise to a claim for
entitlement under sections 8, 12, or 37?

Markem claimed that some of the inventions covered
by claims of the thermal printer group patents were
made at Markem and that this gave them entitlement
to Zipher‚Äôs patents as sole owners or as co-owners.
Importantly, Markem did not allege that Zipher or
any of its employees had done anything wrong or
unlawful; nor did it advance a case of breach of con-
Ô¨Ådence, breach of contract, breach of Ô¨Åduciary duty
or other rule of law as part of its entitlement claim.
Markem claimed that it was entitled to apply for
the patents under section 7 Patents Act 1977,5 which
states that

(1) Any person may make an application for a patent

either alone or jointly with another.

5 All references to sections are to sections of the Patents Act 1977.

(2) A patent for an invention may be granted‚Äî

(a) primarily

to
inventors; . . .

the

inventor

or

joint

(b) in preference to the foregoing, to any person
or persons who, by virtue of any enactment
or rule of law . . . , or by virtue of an enforce-
able term of any agreement entered into with
the inventor before the making of the inven-
tion, was or were at the time of making of
the invention entitled to the whole of the
property in it . . .

(3) In this Act ‚Äòinventor‚Äô in relation to an invention
means the actual deviser of the invention and
‚Äòjoint inventor‚Äô shall be construed accordingly.

On the basis that it was entitled to apply for a
patent for the inventions under section 7, Markem
relied on the provisions of sections 8, 12, and 37,
which relate to the determination of questions of
entitlement before the grant of the patent (section 8),

convention patents

(section 12), and after the patent has been granted
(section 37). As neither party suggested that there
was a material difference in the mechanism for deter-
mination of entitlement under these three sections,
Jacob LJ based his judgment on section 8. By infer-
ence, however, the same principles will apply to sec-
tions 12 and 37.

Jacob LJ held that the question of whether Markem
was entitled to apply for a patent under section 7 was
irrelevant to the question of whether it was entitled to
another party‚Äôs patent application. Some other rule of
law would have to be invoked to claim entitlement
of another party‚Äôs patent application. As noted,
Markem did not assert at any point that Zipher or
any of its employees did anything wrong or unlawful
in the work carried out at Zipher or in making the
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is not enough for the claimant to show that
he came up with the inventive concept if
the owner of the patent came up with the
inventive concept independently and
happened to file the invention first

patent applications that were the subject of
the
dispute. Jacob LJ added that there would be great
uncertainty and damage to freedom of employment
and research if the law were to be different. An
ex-employee should be free to use information that
is not a conÔ¨Ådential trade secret or is otherwise con-
Ô¨Ådential. Use of that information to make an inven-
tion should entitle the ex-employee to apply for a
patent.

The take-home message is that, in order to advance
an entitlement case under sections 8, 12, or 37, it is
not enough to show that you could have made your
own application for a patent under section 7. The
burden should be on the party claiming entitlement
to demonstrate a link between the inventive concept
as conceived and owned by that party and the patent
application as made by the other party. It is not
enough for the claimant to show that he came up
with the inventive concept if the owner of the patent
came up with the inventive concept independently
and happened to Ô¨Åle the invention Ô¨Årst. The only
way that the claimant will be entitled to the patent
will be if he can show some breach of a rule of law
and, most commonly, this will be based on a breach

of conÔ¨Ådence, breach of contract, or breach of a
Ô¨Åduciary duty.

Markem also argued that

the Comptroller (ie
the Patent OfÔ¨Åce) had no jurisdiction in respect of
issues such as breach of conÔ¨Ådence and restrictive
covenants. It followed, Markem argued, that if the
Comptroller had no jurisdiction to determine such
issues, he also lacked jurisdiction to determine such
issues as part of an entitlement claim: given that the
Comptroller did have jurisdiction to hear entitlement
claims under sections 8, 12, and 37, it necessarily
followed that entitlement claims should not include
questions such as breach of conÔ¨Ådence. The Court
of Appeal disagreed with this reasoning, holding
that the Comptroller‚Äôs jurisdiction in matters of en-
titlement included the determination of questions as
to the legal rights of each of the parties. It was not
enough to determine who was responsible for devis-
ing the inventive concept: it was also necessary to
determine who had legal title to the inventive con-
cept. Where the matter involved complicated ques-
tions of fact or law the Comptroller could always
refer the case to the Court.

The Court of Appeal clearly envisaged that, besides
an entitlement action based on sections 8, 12, and 37,
a party could also bring an independent action for
breach of conÔ¨Ådence, breach of contract, or breach
of a Ô¨Åduciary duty where equity could compel a per-
son to hand over the ‚Äòproceeds‚Äô of his wrong‚Äîwhich
could include the legal title to the patent. Given that
an entitlement claim needs to be linked to some
breach of a rule of law, opportunities will always exist
to plead an independent action for breach of that rule
of law. The Comptroller will not, however, have juris-
diction to deal with such independent actions and a
party will have to consider whether it wishes to bring
separate court proceedings.

To what extent can validity be an issue
in entitlement proceedings?

Markem argued that the issue of validity was irrelevant
to entitlement proceedings and that the only question
was who was entitled to the invention. The Court of
Appeal found this approach illogical and held that

If the patent or part of it is clearly and unarguably
invalid, then we see no reason why as a matter of
convenience, the Comptroller [or the Court] should

discretion. . . Only when there is self-evidently no bone
should the dogs be prevented from fighting over it.6
(emphasis added).

Thus a party cannot be entitled to a patent if an
inherent part of the entitlement claim includes evid-
ence that, if accepted, would result in the patent being
clearly and unarguably invalid, and the Court or
Comptroller exercises its right to revoke that patent.
A party wishing to claim patent entitlement should,
prior to initiating proceedings, assess whether the
evidence supporting the entitlement claim also ques-
tions the validity of the patent. Where the validity
of the patent is put into question, the party should
consider including an invalidity claim as part of the
proceedings. A successful entitlement action is, how-
ever, likely to be preferable to a successful invalidity
action as, in the former case, the claimant becomes
the owner of the patent whereas, in the latter, anyone
may use the invention disclosed in the patent.

Are the terms of the claims relevant
in proceedings under sections 8, 12,
and 37?

To determine who contributed to what, Markem rea-
soned that a claim-by-claim analysis was required. To
support this view, Markem relied on section 125(1),
which states that ‚Äòan invention . . . shall, unless the
context otherwise requires, be taken to be that
speciÔ¨Åed in a claim . . .‚Äô. Zipher disagreed with this
approach and argued that what mattered was what
was really invented.

The Court of Appeal agreed with Zipher. Jacob LJ
distinguished between provisions in the Patents Act
1977 that were ‚Äòhome-grown‚Äô and provisions that
were derived from the European Patent Convention
(EPC): sections 8, 12, and 37 fell into the former cat-
egory while section 125(1) belonged in the latter. The
meaning of ‚Äòinvention‚Äô in sections 8, 12, and 37 need
not necessarily conform to the meaning in the EPC-
derived provisions. Jacob LJ held that the meaning
of
in section 8 (and, by inference,
sections 12 and 37) must have a more general mean-
ing that which is contained in the claims. He rea-
soned that section 8 applied to situations where
claims are yet to be drafted and the principle of
in such circumstances
what an invention meant

‚Äòinvention‚Äô

must remain the same once the claims were drafted.
He thus held that section 8 essentially referred to
information in the speciÔ¨Åcation rather than the form
of the claims: ‚ÄòWho contributed to what and what
rights if any they had in it lies at the heart of the
enquiry, not what monopolies were actually claimed‚Äô.7
He added that, as a general rule, one should start with
the speciÔ¨Åc disclosure in the patent (ie ‚Äòthe heart‚Äô of
the invention) and ask whether that involved the
use of information that was really that of the applic-
ant, wholly or in part as a joint owner.

As an aside, although Jacob LJ reasoned that the
meaning of ‚Äòinvention‚Äô in section 125(1) was essen-
tially about the monopoly granted and hence what
was in the claims, there would be instances where
the context would otherwise require, as clearly
envisaged in section 125(2).

4. Procedural fairness
Mr Steve Buckby was Zipher‚Äôs principal witness.
Managing Director of Markem‚Äôs UK subsidiary
when he left in 1999 to found Zipher, he was not
a named co-inventor in any of the patents but was
thoroughly familiar with the technology and was
involved in the prosecution of the patents.

At Ô¨Årst instance, Judge Fysh found Buckby to be a
witness in whom he did not have much conÔ¨Ådence.
He felt that, although a patent agent (Mr Allman)
drafted the claims of the thermal printer patents,
it was Buckby, and not the named inventors, who
had been the principal architect in determining the
scope of the patent claims. Judge Fysh held that
he would only accept the critical parts of Buckby‚Äôs
evidence when it had been corroborated. Jacob LJ
disagreed with Judge Fysh‚Äôs assessment and felt that
the approach by Allman and Buckby was a normal
and desirable cooperation between the patent agent
and the client. Further, Jacob LJ did not think that
there was anything sinister in the fact
the
named inventors did not take part in the drafting
and generalization of the claims.

Besides Buckby, Judge Fysh also made adverse Ô¨Ånd-
ings about three of the named inventors, Mr Philip
Hart, Mr Keith Buxton, and Mr Martin McNestry.

recollect a meeting minuted by Mr Chris Adkin while
they were employed at Markem, which all the inventors
attended (the ‚ÄòAdkin Memorandum‚Äô). Judge Fysh said,
‚ÄòI reject this tale of collective amnesia as being inher-
ently unlikely among persons who gave me the impres-
sion of being both alert, astute and above all, technically
able.‚Äô8 In addition, Judge Fysh felt that Buckby was not
frank about the Adkin Memorandum, given his com-
manding position and technical awareness at Markem
at the time of the meeting.

Judge Fysh said, ‚ÄòI reject this tale of collective
amnesia as being unlikely among persons who
give the impression of being alert, astute and
technically able‚Äô
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Although Markem conceded during the appeal
that Judge Fysh was wrong to make adverse Ô¨Åndings
about Buckby and the inventors, Jacob LJ dealt with
this issue in his judgment as he believed it would
be right to do so given that the reputation of the
witnesses had been tarnished. Jacob LJ also took the
opportunity to cite at length the rule in Browne v
Dunn on procedural
fairness, as the case is only
reported in a very obscure set of reports and is
difÔ¨Åcult to obtain. He did so by citing the material
passages of Browne v Dunn via the Australian decision
of Hunt
in Allied Pastoral Holdings v Federal
Commissioner of Taxation.9

J

In essence the rule states that, where the Court is
asked to disbelieve a witness on a particular point,
the witness should be cross-examined to give him an
opportunity to explain and defend himself. Failure
to cross-examine the witness will imply the acceptance
of the evidence given by the witness, unless the witness
has had full notice that there is an intention to ques-
tion his credibility or the evidence is in itself fanciful.
Jacob LJ summarized the rule in Browne v Dunn
by stating that ‚Äòprocedural fairness not only to the
parties but to the witnesses requires that if their
evidence were to be disbelieved they must be given a
fair opportunity to deal with the allegation‚Äô.10 Neither

Buckby nor the inventors were challenged in cross-
examination as to the truthfulness of their evidence.
In fact, Judge Fysh was not even asked to disbelieve
the witnesses and Jacob LJ held that Judge Fysh
should not have drawn adverse inferences from the
witness evidence.

Jacob LJ held that it was not necessary to explore
the limits to the rule in Browne v Dunn as the case
fell squarely within it. In that case Lord Morris
warned against having hard-and-fast
rules with
regard to cross-examining a witness as a necessary
preliminary to questioning a witness‚Äô credibility. This
does, however, raise some questions:

(i) To what extent and in what manner should one
cross-examine the witness for it to fall within
the rule in Browne v Dunn?

(ii) If the witness is not cross-examined, and his
credibility is challenged, how clearly should
notice be given?

(iii) When will evidence be regarded as fanciful?

If in doubt, and where a party wishes to challenge
the credibility of a witness, he should always
question his credibility in clear terms during cross-
examination.

Irrespective of the rule in Browne v Dunn, Jacob LJ
also held that the trial judge‚Äôs reasons for the adverse
Ô¨Åndings were inadequate. To reach this view, the
Court of Appeal re-assessed the evidence and con-
sidered that they could form their view on the basis
of the trial transcript as, in his judgment, Judge Fysh
had said that he ‚Äòdid not Ô¨Ånd the witnesses to be liars
by reason of their bearing or demeanour‚Äô.11 The prob-
lem with this is that Judge Fysh stated at paragraph
116 of the Ô¨Årst instance judgment that ‚ÄòI observed
Messrs McNestry and Buxton whilst they were giving
this evidence and formed the impression that this
forgetfulness (particularly on the part of Mr Buxton)
was exaggerated‚Äô. This criticism is, however, academic
as Markem conceded the point during the appeal.

5. Abuse of process

Markem referred their claim of entitlement

Comptroller. Shortly thereafter, a number of emplo-
yees of Zipher commenced proceedings in the High
Court seeking declaratory relief on the basis that the
reference brought by Markem amounted to allega-
tions of breach of conÔ¨Ådentiality. Markem then
attempted to strike out the High Court action as an
abuse of process. In a hearing in December 2002,
Markem denied that
the entitlement proceedings
included an assertion that the individuals seeking
declarations had breached obligations of conÔ¨Ådential-
ity. The Comptroller by then had decided to refer the
entitlement proceedings to the High Court, and Jacob
LJ (as he then was) stayed the declaratory proceed-
ings‚Äô pending resolution of the entitlement action.

Well before the start of the trial on entitlement,
Markem had available all of
the information it
required to bring a claim of breach of conÔ¨Ådence.
Markem did not, however, add such an action to
the entitlement proceedings, and Zipher was the

In May 2004,
Markem unsuccessfully sought to lift the stay on the
declaratory proceedings and in June 2004 Markem
began an action for breach of conÔ¨Ådence against
four individuals working at Zipher. The defendants
in that action responded by applying to strike out
the action as an abuse of process under rule 3.4 of
the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR).

The defendants argued that the fresh action arose
out of exactly the same factual background as the
patent entitlement action and should have been
brought at the same time. Judge Fysh (who heard
the case) was of the view that Jacob LJ‚Äôs intention in
the hearing in December 2002 was to ‚Äòpark‚Äô all further
consideration of conÔ¨Ådential information issues until
the conclusion at Ô¨Årst instance of the entitlement
action. As such, Markem‚Äôs breach of conÔ¨Ådence
action was not an abuse of process.

CPR 3.4(2) states,

‚ÄòThe court may strike out a
statement of case if it appears to the court . . . that
the statement of case is an abuse of the court‚Äôs pro-
cess or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal
of the proceedings.‚Äô The Court of Appeal noted that,
as the power to strike out was discretionary, it would
only interfere with the decision at Ô¨Årst instance if
that decision was plainly wrong.

ARTICLE

The parties agreed that the principles set down in
Henderson v Henderson as considered by the House of
Lords in Johnson v Gore Wook & Co12 laid down the
law that had to be applied. In essence, the rule in
Henderson v Henderson requires that issues and facts
that are clearly part of the subject-matter of the litiga-
tion should be brought forward in the same action.
The reasoning behind the doctrine is based on public
policy as it is in the general public interest, and in the
interest of the parties, that litigation should not drag
on and that the defendant should not be oppressed
by successive proceedings. Importantly, failure to com-
ply with the rule does not automatically amount to an
abuse of process. The doctrine should only be applied
when the facts amount to an abuse, ie an unjust harass-
ment of a party. The decision should be broad and
merit-based, taking account of the public and private
interests and all of the facts, focusing on whether, in
all the circumstances, a party is abusing the process of
the court. The Court must balance a claimant‚Äôs right
to bring an action with a defendant‚Äôs right to be protec-
ted from being harassed by multiple proceedings.

The Court of Appeal held that, having examined all
of the circumstances, the decision of Judge Fysh was
wrong. Once Markem had all the available informa-
tion to allege breach of conÔ¨Ådence it was under an
obligation to bring an action or to abandon it but
was not entitled to keep it in reserve, awaiting the
outcome of
the entitlement proceedings, as this
amounted to harassment.

Given that entitlement proceedings will always
involve some breach of law, questions arise as to (i)
whether any entitlement referral to the Comptroller
should also be accompanied by independent proceed-
ings in the Court for breach of that rule of law and
(ii) when such a claim should be started. The decision
will depend on the circumstances of each case and
highlights the need to review the case strategy at a
number of key stages during proceedings.

Whether or not one agrees with the guidance
provided by the Court of Appeal in Markem v Zipher
to the application of the entitlement provisions in
the Patents Act 1977, the guidance will have to be fol-
lowed for the foreseeable future as, on 26 October
2005, the House of Lords refused Markem‚Äôs petition
for leave to appeal.
