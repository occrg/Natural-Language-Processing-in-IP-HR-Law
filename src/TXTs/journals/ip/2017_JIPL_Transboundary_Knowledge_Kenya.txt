Transboundary knowledge and regional
cooperation in the protection of traditional
knowledge in Kenya
Harriet Deacon*

Introduction

In 2016, the ‚ÄòProtection of Traditional Knowledge and
Cultural Expressions Act‚Äô (hereafter,
‚Äòthe Act‚Äô) was
passed in Kenya.1 The Act aims ‚Äòto provide a frame-
work for the protection and promotion of traditional
knowledge and cultural expressions‚Äô in Kenya, giving
effect to articles 11, 40 and 69(1)(c) of the revised
Constitution of 2010.2

(TK)

knowledge

and traditional

The question of whether and how to provide sui ge-
neris intellectual property (IP) protection for tradi-
tional
cultural
expressions (TCEs) has been controversial. In this arti-
cle, we will not revisit questions about whether tradi-
tional knowledge3 deserves sui generis IP protection, or
the merits and methods of developing an international
legal instrument to do so. Instead, we consider a few of
the questions that arise when IP protection of TK be-
comes a legal reality at the national level, for example
under the Kenya Protection of Traditional Knowledge
and Cultural Expressions Act of 2016.

Most of the commentary on the Act to date has fo-
cused on provisions for implementation at the national
level.4 It is also very important to consider provisions
for transboundary TK and cross-border cooperation be-
cause much TK is shared across national boundaries.
The shared nature of TK is very evident in Africa, where
nineteenth-century colonial administrations negotiated
many borders without reference to local settlement pat-
terns. Rights in TK are highly likely to be infringed by
third parties across national borders, not just through
misappropriation by large multinationals in the global
North but also, as African industry grows, within the

 In 2016, the ‚ÄòProtection of Traditional Knowledge and Cultural

Expressions Act‚Äô (hereafter, ‚Äòthe Act‚Äô) was passed in Kenya. The
Act aims to ‚Äòto provide a framework for the protection and
promotion of traditional knowledge and cultural expressions‚Äô
in Kenya.

 Much of what is deÔ¨Åned as Traditional Knowledge (TK) in

legislation such as this is shared across national boundaries,
and infringements of rights in TK are likely to take place
across national borders too. However, provisions for pro-
tection of rights in TK differ widely between states in the
absence of an international standard-setting instrument in
this area. The lack of a strong regional mechanism in Africa
for cross-border cooperation on TK creates opportunities
for conÔ¨Çict over shared transboundary TK, reduces oppor-
tunities for addressing cross-border infringement and redu-
ces regional negotiating power on third-party licensing.

regulations, and suggest ways of developing stronger re-
gional mechanisms for cross-border cooperation on the
protection of TK.

region. Many African states have passed, or are consid-
ering, TK legislation,5 but their laws are very diverse in
the absence of an international standard-setting instru-
ment in this area. There is also no strong regional
mechanism in Africa for cross-border cooperation on
registration and enforcement of rights in TK, or indeed
on IP in general.

This article analyses provisions for protection of
transboundary (shared) TK and cross-border coopera-
tion in the Act, especially at a regional level. This analy-
sis may inform the further development of the Act and
associated legislation or regulations, and highlight some
ways of developing stronger regional mechanisms for
cross-border cooperation on the protection of TK.

The international context

Conventionally, all IP rights are territorial, as the na-
ture of protection is deÔ¨Åned by national law and the
scope of protection is limited to the boundaries of the
states that grant it. This generally means that only the
law of the country for which protection is sought (lex
loci protectionis) applies when determining, for exam-
ple, what IP rights exist, whether they have been in-
fringed and what remedies exist.6 Because many IP
actions have a transnational dimension,7 however, a
system of multilateral agreements (such as the Paris
and Berne Conventions) has been negotiated. These
agreements, which generally only cover conventional
IP and not TK, have achieved a certain degree of uni-
formity between states by requiring domestic IP laws
to make provision for substantive minimum rights.
Some degree of cross-border protection is achieved by

requiring provision for national treatment, where for-
eign IP rightholders are given the same protection as
citizens of a country.8

under

the World

One of the main attractions of negotiating the TRIPS
agreement
Trade
Organization (WTO) was that it offered for the Ô¨Årst
time a multilateral dispute resolution mechanism for
IP-related issues.10 So far, this mechanism has primarily
been used by the United States, Canada, the European
Union and Australia in disputes among themselves,
rather than in disputes with or between developing
states.11

TRIPS does not confer any speciÔ¨Åc IP protection on
TK as such, and there has been some debate as to
whether it can be regarded as intellectual property at all
under TRIPS.12 In the late 1990s, TK brieÔ¨Çy became a
mainstream negotiating issue in the TRIPS negotia-
tions.13 At this time, DutÔ¨Åeld described the role of TK
within the TRIPS negotiations as:

an issue formulated and promoted by NGOs, subsequently
adopted by trade negotiators, and then introduced into a
highly unpromising forum for achieving solutions on TK,
yet the most effective forum for the pursuit of a rather dif-
ferent agenda: that of justifying decelerated compliance
with TRIPS [by some developing states] and perhaps even
rolling back the strong IPRs it requires WTO members to
provide.14

Partly as a sidelining tactic, the discussion on IP protec-
tion for TK was shifted from the WTO to the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) around the
time of the Doha Declaration in 2001,15 although the
issue still comes up in TRIPS negotiations around arti-
cles 27.3(b) and 29bis.16

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2017, Vol. 12, No. 3

At WIPO, in spite of some successes in the area of
related rights,17 member states have not yet been able
to reach agreement on an international instrument that
sets minimum standards or normative guidelines for
protection of TK. The Intergovernmental Committee
on Intellectual Property
and Genetic Resources,
Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC) was tasked
to develop an international instrument for protecting
IP rights associated with genetic resources (GRs), TK
and TCEs.

SigniÔ¨Åcant distance still remains between the posi-
the negotiating parties in WIPO‚Äôs IGC.18
tions of
Viewed in historical perspective, the differences be-
tween member states‚Äô positions cannot be explained
only in terms of the speciÔ¨Åc character of TK. They are
linked to differing national interests in trade and com-
merce. IP rights regimes have expanded in many ways
in the last few decades in areas that have beneÔ¨Åted the
global North; many of these states only sought to be
part of international agreements on IP as these became
economically advantageous to them.19 At
the same
time, for developing states, TK is not just part of a ne-
gotiating strategy in trade forums on the international
level. Promulgating national sui generis laws for TK can
be part of a populist (or even nationalist) development
discourse highlighting the value of reclaiming ‚Äònational‚Äô
or ‚Äòindigenous‚Äô assets and beneÔ¨Åting communities at
the national level. It also holds out possibility of gener-
ating beneÔ¨Åts for state agencies and local commercial
enterprises, for example through compulsory licensing
and state ownership of TK.20

Other international instruments related to
the protection of TK

SigniÔ¨Åcant attention has been paid to the question of
TK (at least in a narrower sense of knowledge associ-
ated with biogenetic
resources) within the UN

Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).21 This fo-
rum provided developing states with a negotiating toe-
hold on the issue internationally as it acknowledged the
value of TK and the need for beneÔ¨Åt sharing.22 The
CBD‚Äôs Nagoya Protocol (2014),23 now ratiÔ¨Åed by nearly
80 states, requires that when GRs and associated TK are
accessed and used by third parties, fair and equitable
access and beneÔ¨Åt sharing (ABS) agreements have to be
entered into with relevant communities (or states par-
ties) on mutually agreed terms.24 While the Nagoya
Protocol is not an agreement about IP rights, and only
covers access to and use of TK associated with GRs (the
Protocol does not refer to TCEs), it provides ways of es-
tablishing enforceable contracts between providers and
users of these resources, even across national borders.
To this end, article 11 calls for transboundary coopera-
tion on the protection of TK shared across national
borders.

The case for protecting IP rights in TK at the inter-
national level has been further strengthened because of
the increased attention paid to issues of cultural rights,
social justice and misappropriation of culture in various
international forums. For example, article 11 of the
United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP, 2007)25 states that in-
digenous peoples have the right to ‚Äòmaintain, protect
and develop‚Äô their cultural expressions. States shall pro-
vide mechanisms for redress in regard to ‚Äòcultural, in-
tellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without
their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of
their laws, traditions and customs‚Äô. The 2003 UNESCO
Convention for the Safeguarding of
the Intangible
Cultural Heritage, which acknowledges the rights of
communities to manage and beneÔ¨Åt from the practice
of their intangible heritage (broadly contiguous with
TK in the general sense), and encourages states to pro-
tect these rights using intellectual property law, among
other means.26 Although it was initially promoted at

Convention,27

Even though the Intangible Heritage Convention
does not itself affect IP rights,28 its international listing
mechanisms have been used in some cases as a way of
asserting moral claims to cultural ‚Äòownership‚Äô over heri-
tage. Although international cooperation is one of the
stated purposes of the Convention in article 1, this has
led in some circumstances to increased regional tension
over competing claims to transboundary heritage.29
Similar tensions are likely to arise in relation to claims
to IP rights protection in TK.

Given the multifaceted and fractured international
framework relating to TK, and the uncertain prospects
for any agreement on a sui generis instrument at the in-
ternational level, a number of states have put signiÔ¨Åcant
effort into the development of mechanisms for regional
cooperation. This can include establishment of regional
TK databases, efforts to harmonize differences between
national legislation, and mechanisms for the adjudica-
tion of cross-border disputes.30 Regional cooperation
can help to increase bargaining power of TK holders in
negotiations with third parties and to reduce conÔ¨Çict
between stakeholders at the regional level.31 Although
the development of a common ABS framework under
the Nagoya Protocol has been slow at the international
level, African Union (AU) guidelines developed for
member
implementing the Nagoya Protocol
highlight the importance of regional cooperation for
precisely this reason.32 Regional cooperation within
Africa may become even more strategically important
as more commercial ventures are established to exploit
resources within the continent.

the vote on the UNDRIP Declaration, but in its revised

position. Kenya has also ratiÔ¨Åed the 2003 UNESCO

International instruments like these have direct effect
in Kenyan law,33 but none confer any IP rights on com-
munities in respect of their TK. The granting of sui ge-
neris IP rights in TK at the national level is thus a
signiÔ¨Åcant statement of intent to pursue the issue at the
international level, even where economic gains there-
from are uncertain and international enforcement
mechanisms
remain weak. The
Constitution of Kenya provides the rationale for such
legislation in Kenya, preÔ¨Ågured by the National Policy
on Traditional Knowledge, Genetic Resources and
Traditional Cultural Expressions (2009). Article 40(5)
of the Constitution commits the state to supporting,
promoting and protecting the IP rights of the ‚Äòpeople
of Kenya‚Äô, and article 69(1)(c) speciÔ¨Åcally tasks it to
‚Äòprotect and enhance‚Äô IP and ‚Äòindigenous knowledge‚Äô
associated with biodiversity and the ‚Äògenetic resources
of the communities‚Äô. Article 11 provides the basis for
enacting legislation to ensure that ‚Äòcommunities receive
royalties for the use of their cultures and cultural heri-
tage‚Äô (TCEs) and that indigenous GR and associated TK
are recognized and protected. The Constitution of
Kenya, and the Act itself, thus frame the beneÔ¨Åts of IP
protection of TK as primarily local (for communities in
Kenya) and national (for Kenya as a nation state).

In Africa, regional instruments and mechanisms for
protecting TK have been relatively weak. Kenya is a

Property Organization (ARIPO).34 Kenya signed but
has not yet ratiÔ¨Åed ARIPO‚Äôs Swakopmund Protocol,
which entered into force in 2015.35 The Swakopmund
Protocol offers protection to a broad range of TK and
makes provision for dispute resolution mechanism
through ARIPO although this does not yet seem to be
operational. The Protocol deals with the diverse
approaches of its members by restoring ‚Äòthe ownership
of expressions of folklore to communities‚Äô on the one
hand while still recognizing ‚Äòstate control and manage-
ment of expressions of folklore‚Äô on the other, which has
been the source of some criticism.36 The predominantly
francophone membership of the African Intellectual
Property Organization (OAPI)37 has uniÔ¨Åed IP protec-
tion for members. The OAPI Bangui Agreement only
protects literary and artistic works created by or within
a ‚Äòtraditional community‚Äô, however, and thus has a nar-
rower scope than the Protocol.38 Partly because key
states such as South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt are not
members of either ARIPO or OAPI, a new Pan African
Intellectual Property Organization (PAIPO) has been
proposed under the umbrella of the AU.39

Other mechanisms for regional cooperation on TK
will be created through IP chapters in free trade agree-
ments that may create a continent-wide free trade area
as early as 2017.40 Kenya is also a signatory to a
Tripartite Free Trade Area Agreement between the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), the
East African Community (EAC) and the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), in
which the IP chapter is still under discussion. Early
drafts indicate an intention to continue developing na-
tional legislation on TK, pressing for change at an inter-
national level, and fostering further cooperation within
Africa on the issue.41 The East African Community
Treaty requires Partner States ‚Äòto promote co-operation
in the development of science and technology within
the Community‚Äô through, among other things, ‚Äòthe en-
couragement of the use and development of indigenous
science and technologies‚Äô and ‚Äòthe harmonisation of
policies on . . . promotion and protection of intellectual

property rights‚Äô.42 Article 43 of the Protocol on the
Establishment of the EAC Common Market requires
partner states to provide legal protection for TK. Some
research has begun on harmonization of IP laws in the
EAC in anticipation of the development of a new
commonly-held IP regime, but no directives on inter-
national cooperation on IP have yet been drafted.43

Cross-border cooperation on the protection of TK is
thus an important consideration in Africa, and the sub-
ject of new initiatives such as the establishment of
PAIPO and the Ô¨Ånalization of free trade agreements, as
well as proposed mechanisms for the implementation
of the Nagoya Protocol. Provisions at the national level
for the protection of TK in Kenya will need to facilitate
regional cooperation within this changing context. To
discuss this further, we now turn to a closer examina-
tion of the Act and its provisions for transboundary TK
and cross-border cooperation.

A brief summary of provisions in
the Act

Broadly following the framework of the Swakopmund
Protocol,44 the Act deÔ¨Ånes a wide range of subject mat-
ter as TK, including that which may come under the
ambit of patents, copyright, designs, trade marks and
geographical indications, whether or not it is ‚Äòreduced
to a material form‚Äô or documented.45 The Act refers to
‚Äòcultural expressions‚Äô rather than ‚Äòtraditional cultural
expressions‚Äô, which is the conventional term in interna-
tional negotiations, and was the preferred term in the
2015 Bill46 and the earlier National Policy on TK
(2009). However, the term ‚Äòcultural expressions‚Äô in the
Act clearly covers the same subject matter as TCEs; it
refers to ‚Äòany forms, whether tangible or intangible, in
which traditional culture and knowledge are expressed,
appear or are manifested‚Äô.47

The Act narrows the subject matter by providing
protection only to TK48 ‚Äògenerated, preserved and
transmitted‚Äô over generations in a community with

which they are ‚Äòdistinctively associated‚Äô and ‚Äòintegral to
[its] cultural identity‚Äô.49 These expressions are only pro-
tected against unauthorized use outside of the ‚Äòtradi-
tional context‚Äô. ‚ÄòOwners‚Äô or ‚Äòholders‚Äô of TK are limited
in section 2 to ‚Äòlocal and traditional communities‚Äô and
those recognized within these communities as having
special authority over TK. The terminology ‚Äòlocal and
traditional communities‚Äô differs from that in the WIPO
context, viz. ‚Äòindigenous and local communities‚Äô, be-
cause of concerns about the relevance to Africa of ‚Äòpre-
colonial‚Äô and ‚Äòaboriginal‚Äô (Ô¨Årst resident) concepts in the
broad understanding of indigenous peoples that was
generally accepted in Europe and the Americas. Thus,
as proposed by the African Commission‚Äôs Working
Group (2005), the term indigenous is used mainly for
hunter-gatherer or pastoralist communities associated
with a speciÔ¨Åc territory, identity and culture, and shar-
ing a common experience of marginalization.50

The Act offers both defensive and positive protection
for TK through a rights-based approach that follows
some of the ideas discussed in the WIPO IGC.51 It con-
fers both moral52 and economic53 sui generis rights on
‚Äòowners‚Äô and ‚Äòholders‚Äô of TK (or in their absence, a state
agency), providing similar kinds of protection as in
copyright, trade marks, patents and geographical indica-
tions law. These rights are conferred without formalities
and exist in perpetuity as long as the subject matter com-
plies with the requirements for protection.54 The Act
provides for both criminal and civil penalties for in-
fringement, and mediation or alternative dispute resolu-
tion procedures or customary protocols not inconsistent
with the Constitution.55 It establishes requirements for
prior informed consent (going beyond provisions in the
Swakopmund Protocol)56 and beneÔ¨Åt sharing agree-
ments with any third parties in connection with the ex-
ploitation of TK outside the ‚Äòtraditional context‚Äô.57

Provision is made for a county or national level reg-
istration process on a Traditional Knowledge Digital
Repository (TKDR), managed by the Kenya Copyright
Board (KECOBO), but registration is purely declaratory

and does not confer rights in itself.58 It is not clear
from the Act whether KECOBO is the Authority or
National Competent Authority (NCA) referred to in
sections 32 and 42.59 The Cabinet Secretary, working
with county ofÔ¨Åcials60 and holder or owner communi-
ties, is given considerable responsibility to record, man-
age and resolve disputes about user agreements,
licenses, assignments and compulsory licenses.61 Some
disputes can also be resolved by KECOBO.62 Dispute
resolution by these different agencies, including com-
munities themselves in section 30(1), may have slightly
different outcomes. For example, where the Cabinet
Secretary refers disputes to those claiming to be holders
under section 30(1), they may be unable to reach agree-
ment, but in disputes over concurrent claims under sec-
tion 7(6) for inclusion of TK on the register, KECOBO
or the county government may make a ruling even
where holders are still in dispute.

In the Act as a whole, as Nzomo suggests, there is ‚Äòan
overlap of responsibilities‚Äô between county and national
governments, and between KECOBO and the Cabinet
Secretary. These include responsibilities for administer-
ing the register, licenses or assignments and settling dis-
putes over ownership of rights. To reduce problems that
may arise from overlapping roles, Nzomo argues that
most of the responsibilities of the Cabinet Secretary,
aside from compulsory licensing, could be taken over by
KECOBO, which already manages the Register.63

Having brieÔ¨Çy reviewed the Act, which provides for
extensive rights in perpetuity over a wide range of new
subject matter, we now examine how it deals with ques-
tions of transboundary TK and cross-border coopera-
tion, especially at the regional level.

Provisions for transboundary TK and
cross-border cooperation

The National Policy on TK (2009) promoted both re-
gional and international cooperation and cross-border
mechanisms such as the Swakopmund Protocol (then

in draft form) were explicitly mentioned.64 In contrast,
perhaps to avoid overlap with the proposed National
Culture Bill, or with the Swakopmund Protocol, the
Act does not mention ARIPO, its Protocol or interna-
tional cooperation, focusing instead on cooperation be-
tween county and national government.65 The Act
makes rather patchy provision for administering trans-
boundary TK, and does not mention communication
and cooperation with agencies in other states, or re-
gional organizations. At present, neither Kenya nor its
neighbouring states have ratiÔ¨Åed the Swakopmund
Protocol.66

Administration of transboundary TK

According to the Swakopmund Protocol, the owners of
transboundary TK should be registered by the ‚Äòrelevant
national competent authority of the Contracting States
and [the] ARIPO OfÔ¨Åce‚Äô.67 This approach makes sense
in order to ensure that transboundary TK is registered
at the national level.

The administration of transboundary TK is handled
in a rather inconsistent way in the Act. As mentioned
above, the Act refers to a NCA but does not clearly say
this is KECOBO. The Act does not specify channels of
communication with agencies in other states, or any re-
gional
IP organization such as ARIPO (or indeed
PAIPO, at some later date), regarding negotiation of
beneÔ¨Åt-sharing agreements with communities across na-
tional borders.68 Under section 7 of the Copyright Act,
KECOBO has been given powers to enter into associa-
tions with bodies or organizations in or outside Kenya
‚Äòin furtherance of the purposes for which the Board is es-
tablished‚Äô, so this may include cross-border cooperation
relating to its new duties under the TK Act.

The Act divides duties for the administration of trans-
boundary TK between the Cabinet Secretary and
KECOBO. The registration of ‚Äòowners‚Äô of transboundary
TK is done by the national and county governments.69
KECOBO manages the register, but applications for the
transfer of IP rights ‚Äòin or outside Kenya‚Äô based on TK
‚Äòobtained in Kenya‚Äô require the prior approval of the
Cabinet Secretary.70 Applications for consent to use TK

are to be given directly to ‚Äòthe holders‚Äô of that TK,71
which could potentially include co-owner communities
of transboundary TK listed on the TK register in Kenya,
who are citizens of other countries. This kind of direct
cross-border information sharing may not be the inten-
tion of the Act, however, since notices identifying the
holders of TK who will be consulted for consent to its
use,72 and disputes over ownership73 will only be pub-
lished by the Cabinet Secretary in Kenyan newspapers
‚Äòwith nationwide circulation‚Äô.

It is not clear how KECOBO and/or the Cabinet
Secretary would interface with the Competent National
Authorities (CNAs) appointed under article 13 of the
Nagoya Protocol, or with regional mechanisms for dis-
pute resolution under that Protocol. The National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has sole
responsibility for implementing all environmental poli-
cies in Kenya including the Nagoya Protocol. NEMA is
empowered in section 11 of
the Environmental
Management and Co-ordination Act to ‚Äòenter into asso-
ciation with other bodies or organisations within or
outside Kenya‚Äô to this end.

Mechanisms for cross-border dispute
resolution

In the Swakopmund Protocol, the ARIPO OfÔ¨Åce is
tasked with ‚Äòraising awareness, education, guidance,
monitoring, dispute resolution and other activities‚Äô in
regard to transboundary TK.74 ARIPO may mediate in
cases of concurrent claims to transboundary TK, using
‚Äòcustomary law, local information sources, alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms, and any other practical
mechanism‚Äô.75 The newly drafted PAIPO Statutes pro-
mote international cooperation and harmonization of
IP systems across the continent, propose some general
mechanisms for dispute resolution, speciÔ¨Åcally focus on
the protection of TK as
IP and the creation of
continent-wide TK databases to aid in its protection.
More detailed plans have yet to be set out, especially re-
garding PAIPO‚Äôs relationship with ARIPO or OAPI,
and harmonization of IP law in the region.76

region. Zambia has

In the meantime, legislation continues to be devel-
oped in the
ratiÔ¨Åed the
Swakopmund Protocol, and the Zambia Protection of
Traditional Knowledge Act speciÔ¨Åcally aims to give ef-
fect to it. It allows for the registration of transboundary
TK and related agreements about its use on the national
register and with ARIPO, and gives their national com-
petent authority (the Registrar) powers to refer disputes
to ARIPO or other regional or international bodies.77
South Africa is not a member of ARIPO, and it has not
ratiÔ¨Åed the Protocol, but the South African Indigenous
Knowledge Systems Bill nevertheless sets up a channel
of communication between their NCA and state agen-
cies in other countries to conclude prior informed con-
sent and beneÔ¨Åt sharing agreements78 in regard to
transboundary ‚Äòindigenous knowledge‚Äô.79 These NCAs
would also need to work with PAIPO, when it is
operational.

There may be some overlap between the cases that
are referred by the NCA under the Act to organizations
like PAIPO, and those referred by NEMA under the
Nagoya Protocol to regional mechanisms for dispute
resolution. AU guidelines for member states imple-
menting the Nagoya Protocol recommend establish-
ment of a Regional Committee of Experts to cooperate
in negotiating agreements with bioprospectors over the
use of their common GR and associated TK.80 The
Committee could help to mediate disputes ‚Äòbetween
Member States, between a Member State and commu-
nities, or between communities‚Äô regarding access to
GRs and associated TK.81 The guidelines point out that
the African Court on Human Rights and Justice could
also potentially hear cases on exploitation of TK if they
concern the African Charter on Human and Peoples‚Äô
Rights and any other relevant human rights instru-
ments. This court ‚Äòhas a mandate to make binding deci-
sions
and
reparation‚Äô.82

Cross-border cooperation and choice of law

In addition to provisions for transboundary TK, the
Swakopmund Protocol requires the ‚Äònational compe-
tent authority and ARIPO‚Äô to establish measures for
protecting TK for the beneÔ¨Åt of holders ‚Äòfrom foreign
countries‚Äô.83 The Swakopmund Protocol gives
the

following guidance on choice of law in national courts
in such cases:

Eligible foreign holders of traditional knowledge and ex-
pressions of folklore shall enjoy beneÔ¨Åts of protection to
the same level as holders of traditional knowledge and ex-
pressions of folklore who are nationals of the country of
protection, taking into account as far as possible the custom-
ary laws and protocols applicable to the traditional knowl-
edge or expressions of
folklore concerned [emphasis
added].84

When assessing mutually agreed terms in ABS agree-
ments for speciÔ¨Åc uses of transboundary TK associated
with GRs, article 15 of the Nagoya Protocol obliges
States Parties to ensure that they comply with ‚Äòaccess
and beneÔ¨Åt-sharing legislation or regulatory require-
ments of the other Party where such indigenous and lo-
cal communities are located‚Äô.

Because of the nature of TK as knowledge regulated
by communities themselves, it is thus considered im-
portant in regional or international instruments to take
customary law and community protocols associated
with the speciÔ¨Åc owners of that TK into account when
making determinations about IP rights. In the case of
transboundary TK, or TK held by foreign citizens, it re-
mains important to take community protocols and laws
in other states into account, as well as aspects of foreign
law.

How does the Act deal with this issue? It already
makes provision for national treatment, but only where
reciprocal agreements are in place,85 and it does recog-
nize the importance of considering customary law,
whether codiÔ¨Åed or uncodiÔ¨Åed, but it is not quite clear
what approach should be adopted in cross-border cases.
What balance, for example, should be sought between
the principle of national treatment (treating foreign IP
rightholders no less favourably than citizens), and rec-
ognition of IP rights conferred in another country?

This is an important question because national laws
on TK may differ widely between neighbouring states.
Communities in Kenya are given extensive IP rights
over their TK,
for example, while in many other
African states the IP rights in TK are conferred on state
agencies acting on behalf of communities. In Malawi,
for example, copyright in ‚Äòexpressions of folklore‚Äô vests
in the Government ‚Äòon behalf and for the beneÔ¨Åt of the
people‚Äô.86

brought in Kenya regarding a TCE found in both
Kenya and Malawi, would the entire transboundary
community be considered a beneÔ¨Åciary in the case, ac-
cording to Kenyan law, or would the foreign beneÔ¨Åciary
be the Malawian state?

Control over access to and use of TK at the commu-
nity level may be exercised in different ways, whether
through informal agreements or through different kinds
of customary law.87 These different kinds of customary
law may well conÔ¨Çict, especially in respect to trans-
boundary TK. Kenyan courts can take foreign law into
account, based on evidence presented by a person
skilled in that area of law.88 The Judicature Act (1977),
which governs conÔ¨Çict of laws in Kenya, indicates in
section 3(2) that customary law may ‚Äòguide‚Äô the court
insofar as it is not inconsistent with the written law or
repugnant to justice and morality. However, it is not
quite clear whether and how customary law from other
states might be taken into account, and whether it
would be subject to the limitations in section 3(2) of
the Judicature Act.

In the Act,

the Cabinet Secretary, KECOBO or
county governments are given powers to adjudicate
TK-related disputes using customary law (as well as
‚Äòother means as are agreed to by the parties‚Äô,89 ‚Äòlocal in-
formation sources and any other means‚Äô,90 or other
unspeciÔ¨Åed means).91 This Ô¨Çexibility could assist in re-
solving conÔ¨Çicts between different kinds of customary
law at the national
level. It does not, however, give
guidance on how Kenyan agencies would work with
agencies or communities in other states to adjudicate
cross-border cases using foreign law or protocols.

National treatment and TRIPS compliance

The Act provides that Kenya ‚Äòmay‚Äô ensure national
treatment for TK from other states, but only in ‚Äòaccor-
dance with reciprocal arrangements‚Äô (ie bilateral or
multilateral agreements).92 It thus leaves open the pos-
sibility that such protection may not be provided. This
may create problems for TRIPS compliance if TK is

regarded as intellectual property under TRIPS. TRIPS
requires that members provide for national treatment
with regard to ‚Äòthe protection of intellectual property‚Äô,
ie treating nationals of other member states no less
favourably than their own.93

Privileges given to nationals of one country should
be given ‚Äòimmediately and unconditionally‚Äô to those of
another.94 In a WTO dispute resolution case about
European protection of geographical indications (GIs),
the Panel found that the availability of GI protection
constituted such a privilege.95 GIs were regarded as in-
tellectual property because provisions for their protec-
tion are included in articles 22‚Äì3 of TRIPS. No such
provision is made for TK in TRIPS. Although protect-
ing rights in TK involves protecting rights in knowledge
rather than nomenclature (as in the case of GIs), it rep-
resents a similar model of collective creation, ownership
and control of access to GIs.96 TK is explicitly regarded
as intellectual property by the AU in the PAIPO
Statutes,97 and, as evidenced in paragraph 19 of the
Doha Declaration, African states such as Kenya support
the recognition of TK as IP under TRIPS.

The South African Indigenous Knowledge Systems
Bill does guarantee national treatment, but also only
where ‚Äòreciprocal international agreements‚Äô are in place
with the foreign jurisdictions concerned.98 Although it
acknowledges the possibility that communities outside
Zambia may have access to rights and beneÔ¨Åts associ-
ated with transboundary TK,99 no speciÔ¨Åc provisions
are made for national treatment or mutual recognition
in the Zambia TK Act, any disputes being left to a me-
diation by the Registrar or regional organizations such
as ARIPO.

It could be argued that in all these cases, any advan-
tage from protection is thus not conferred ‚Äòimmediately
and unconditionally‚Äô on TK from any other country, as
required under TRIPS article 4. Thus, where there are
no reciprocal agreements, TK from other countries

Harriet Deacon  Protection of traditional knowledge in Kenya

ARTICLE

TRIPS Agreement. Kenya has not yet been subject to
any disputes under the WTO dispute resolution pro-
cess, and most disputes have been between developed
states. However, nothing prevents any member state
from opening such a dispute against Kenya, especially if
their industries are being affected by this Act. Such ac-
tion may become increasingly likely within Africa too,
as Kenyan industry develops greater capacities for com-
mercializing TK.

The Act could adopt a similar formulation to section
24.1 of the Swakopmund Protocol to make the legisla-
tion TRIPS compliant. All foreign holders of TK are of-
fered the same level of protection as citizens (ie treated
no less favourably), while foreign law and community
protocols in the communities where the TK originates
are also recognized. If and when the Protocol is ratiÔ¨Åed,
the Act may in fact need to be amended to reduce any
conÔ¨Çict with provisions in the Protocol.

Conclusion

In conclusion, cross-border cooperation and protection
of transboundary TK are important aspects of any sui
generis regime for TK, especially in regions like Africa
where national borders cut across culturally similar
communities and where in the absence of an interna-
tional standard-setting instrument, provisions for TK
differ widely. Neglecting cross-border cooperation, es-
pecially at the regional level, can increase conÔ¨Çict over
ownership and beneÔ¨Åt from TK, and reduce capacity to
negotiate beneÔ¨Åt sharing agreements with third parties.
Cross-border cooperation on TK is thus highlighted
in regional IP instruments such as the Swakopmund
Protocol, in the AU‚Äôs PAIPO Statutes, in regional trade
agreements and in guidelines for implementing the
Nagoya Protocol. National TK legislation in Zambia
and the TK Bill in South Africa also mention the im-
international cooperation and provide
portance of
mechanisms
for
In
Kenya, the importance of cross-border cooperation was
Ô¨Çagged in the National Policy on TK (2009), but while
the Act of 2016 confers broad sui generis protection on
TK, it does not make clear provision for cross-border
cooperation for either the protection of transboundary

communication.

cross-border

TK or the protection of TK originating in other states.
Pursuing cross-border cooperation mainly through re-
ciprocal bilateral agreements with other states (as the
Act seems to suggest in section 44) may create a patch-
work of very inconsistent approaches.

Kenya may ratify the Swakopmund Protocol, which
makes provision for cross-border cooperation and ad-
ministration of transboundary TK between signatory
states. Nevertheless, not all African states will ratify the
Swakopmund Protocol. Either in the Act or some re-
lated instrument, it may therefore be useful to high-
light the importance of cross-border cooperation in
principle, and perhaps also to make some general pro-
vision for it. This might include clarifying the identity
of the NCA responsible for liaising with responsible
agencies in other states, and with regional organiza-
tions such as ARIPO or PAIPO, as well as agencies set
up within Kenya for implementing other instruments,
such as the Nagoya Protocol. Responsibilities for ad-
ministration of records and agreements associated with
the ownership and use of transboundary TK could be
streamlined.

The establishment of PAIPO, implementation of the
Nagoya Protocol in the AU, and provisions in regional
trade agreements may create new regional mechanisms
for administration of transboundary TK, regional coop-
eration, dispute resolution and perhaps also (although
this is less likely) harmonization of laws on TK. The
Swakopmund Protocol may be used as a model in ad-
dressing some issues, such as choice of law in cross-
border cases and standards for national treatment. The
approach taken in the Swakopmund Protocol could
also however be updated to reÔ¨Çect a growing acknowl-
edgement of the need for free, prior and informed con-
sent of communities for the use of
their TK, as
evidenced in the Act. Such regional mechanisms will
have to take into account the fact that databases of TK
are being set up for the implementation of international
instruments such as the Nagoya Protocol and the 2003
UNESCO Convention,
and an African Regional
Committee of Experts under the Nagoya Protocol or
the African Court on Human Rights and Justice could
also be involved in dispute resolution or enforcement
relating to misappropriation of TK.
