B Vodka gets the champagne treatment

Diageo North America, Inc & another v Intercontinental
Brands (ICB) Limited & others [2010] EWCH 17 (Ch),
Mr Justice Arnold, 19 January 2010
The High Court held that allowing VODKAT to be pack-
aged and marketed in its current condition would lead
to the blurring of the exclusivity of the term vodka.

Legal context
The concept of extended passing off began with Bollinger
v Costa Brava Wine Co. Ltd [1960] Ch 262. The court
held that champagne was sparkling wine produced in the
French region of champagne, therefore the use of the
term ‘Spanish champagne’ in reference to sparkling wine
from Spain was likely to mislead members of the public
who were not knowledgeable about champagne into
thinking that the defendant’s wine was champagne. This
case was followed in Vine Products Ltd v Mackenzie [1969]
RPC 1, John Walker & Sons v Henry Ost [1970], and H.P.
Bulmer Ltd v J. Bollinger SA [1978] RPC 79, which dealt
with the legal status of the terms sherry, Scotch whisky,
and champagne cider, respectively.

Erven Warnink BV v J. Townend & Sons Ltd [1979] AC
731 (‘Advocaat’) allowed the courts to consider terms that
did not originate from a geographical area. Goulding J
held that UK consumers had purchased the defendant’s
product thinking that it was advocaat, and the claimant
had suffered damage as a result. It was irrelevant that
advocaat did not indicate geographical importance. This
decision was conﬁrmed by the House of Lords, Lord
Diplock stating that if a product with particular character-
istics had acquired a public reputation, the goodwill in
the name of those entitled to use it should be protected
against deceptive use of the name by others.

Facts and analysis
Diageo, a drinks manufacturer, produced a wide range of
beverages including Smirnoff vodka which,
in the year
ending 30 June 2007, accounted for 40% of the UK vodka
market.

Drinks manufacturer ICB started marketing VODKAT
in April 2005. The product was not vodka but clear, vir-

tually tasteless and 22% alcohol by volume (ABV).
VODKAT was made up of vodka and fermented alcohol
made from oranges. The mixture was then treated to
remove the taste and colour of the fermented alcohol.
After the success of VODKAT, ICB widened the product
range to include VODKAT CLASSICS and VODKAT
SMOOTHIES.

ICB accepted that the purpose of starting the name with
VODKA was to show an association with vodka, but only
that it contained vodka, not that it actually was vodka. ICB
produced VODKAT in bottles commonly used for spirits
with a red screw top bearing the word VODKAT in white
lettering. The front label was reminiscent of other vodka
bottles; the stylization of the word VODKAT, the use of the
word ‘Pure Blend’ printed above a crown device, a silver
lion superimposed in a red shield with the words ‘Alcoholic
Vodka Blend’ in white, a red disc bordered in white bearing
a white lion with the words ‘Gustus Tracio Corroboro’ in
white superimposed on the silver lion, and a red banner
with ‘22% vol IMPERIAL 70cl e’ in white. The rear label
stated that the product was ‘a premium alcoholic vodka
blend that can be enjoyed with your favourite mixer, with or
without ice’. Subsequent changes were made to the get-up
(the versions collectively referred to as the ‘old get-up’) fol-
lowing complaints from the Gin and Vodka Association,
North Yorkshire Trading Standards and Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that it could mislead
the public. The ‘new get-up’ was launched in August 2009
to deal with Diageo’s concerns and included the prominent
statement, ‘Great New Look! Same Great Taste!’

Diageo alleged that ICB was passing off VODKAT as
vodka and that it had breached EC Regulation 110/2008
(‘the Regulation’, on the deﬁnition, description, presen-
tation, labelling, and the protection of geographical indi-
cations of spirit drinks, which prescribes that spirit drinks
should be 37.5 per cent ABV). Diageo dropped the claim for
breach of the Regulation and ICB dropped a counterclaim
against Diageo for breach of competition law. By the time
the case came to trial, VODKAT had been on the market for
over 4.5 years and over 13 million bottles had been sold.

Goodwill
The court found that ‘vodka’ denoted a clearly deﬁned class
of goods, as speciﬁed in the Regulation and evidenced by
the large amount of vodka products sold in the UK from
the 1990s. Arnold J also mentioned that the public could
distinguish various products that contained vodka from
vodka because of the different ways in which they are mar-
keted. In addition, Arnold J held that vodka, as a class of
goods, had a reputation, giving rise to protectible goodwill.

Misrepresentation
Diageo alleged that ICB’s marketing of VODKAT led to
misrepresentation in three ways:

tion of the product when used with the get-up.

Arnold J held that the name VODKAT implied that the
product contained vodka or was vodka. ICB had not
clearly described that the product was not vodka, most
versions of the old get-up were reminiscent of vodka,
instructions were not given to the trade to display the
product well away from vodka and the advertising cam-
paign failed to educate the public as to what the product
actually was. Arnold J was not convinced by the argu-
ments put forward by ICB that VODKAT was sufﬁciently
distinguishable from vodka by the fact that it was not
actually described as vodka, the presence of the ‘22% vol’
label and the low price. He considered that many consu-
mers would have not noticed the label, and those who did
would not have known that this meant that the product
was of a lower strength than vodka or would have
thought that it was a weaker version of vodka. As to the
price, it was true that VODKAT’s price was usually lower
than ‘Cheapest On Display’ vodkas; however, this price
differential would not have alerted all consumers as seen
from the trap purchases discussed in the judgment.

evidence,

reviewing Diageo’s

Confusion
Arnold J found actual confusion and a likelihood of con-
fusion after
including
examples from the advertising industry, journalists, super-
markets, individuals who had made trap purchases, con-
venience stores, pubs and bars, and views of Trading
Standards ofﬁcers. ICB’s assertion that there had only been
a few instances of confusion, given the length of time that
VODKAT had been on sale, was rejected by Arnold J
because a signiﬁcant proportion of those who had been
confused would not have realized it, and those who had
realized it would not have bothered to complain. This was
conﬁrmed by evidence that consumers in the 18–21 age
group were not likely to complain about products.

Diageo did not assert that ICB intended to deceive the
customers with VODKAT and the old get-up. Arnold J
agreed with the argument that ICB did not take care to
clear up the confusion after the adoption of a risky brand
name. The new get-up was less reminiscent of vodka but
it was not enough to avoid confusion, in light of the old
get-up and the fact that ICB marketed the re-brand as ‘a
new look for the same old product’. Diageo also argued
that the re-brand was too late in reversing the perceptions
of
customers who had already been ‘confused’ or
‘deceived’ by the old get-up (however, the re-brand was
less likely to confuse customers who came across the

product for the ﬁrst time). Arnold J considered that these
ﬁndings applied to VODKAT CLASSICS and VODKAT
SMOOTHIES because customers would have been just as
confused by these products as they would have been by
VODKAT itself.

Damage
Arnold J held that, as the market leader in vodka sales,
Diageo would have suffered loss of sales because of con-
fusion, which was different to the loss of sales through
competition. ICB’s marketing of VODKAT was, more
importantly, eroding the distinctiveness of vodka by
extending it to include beverages that were not 37.5 per
cent ABV spirits and lower strength products containing
fermented alcohol. This could be seen by the introduction
of products similar to VODKAT, such as VODKOVA and
VOSHKA, which would have continued if unchecked.
Arnold J concluded that ICB passed off VODKAT as
vodka in the old and new get-up.

Practical signiﬁcance
This judgment, following a long line of cases, conﬁrmed
that vodka had protectible goodwill. Vodka’s uniqueness
was being damaged because it was used in relation to a
product that was not vodka by deﬁnition of its ingredi-
ents or its alcoholic content.

As stated in Advocaat, it was irrelevant whether a term
indicated geographical provenance. It could still have pro-
tectible goodwill in relation to extended passing off.

A claim for extended passing off was not only available
where the class of goods are perceived to be of higher
quality.

The decision also offered practical guidance on how to
carry out and use trap purchases in a passing off action.
The defendant should be given immediate notice of the
allegations so it has the chance to investigate the matter
and provide a defence.

Some interesting comments were made by the judge
concerning ICB’s survey about customers’ views of vodka.
Diageo had made it clear in correspondence that it did
not think the survey would be useful, but it did not
articulate speciﬁc criticisms. Arnold J said that Diageo
was not estopped from advancing criticisms about the
survey at trial. However, it would have been better to
submit them before the trial so that the survey may have
been modiﬁed in response to the criticisms.
