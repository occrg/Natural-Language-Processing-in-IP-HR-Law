  

The F Words: Frauds, Forgeries, and Fakes 
in Antiquities Smuggling and the Role of 
Organized Crime
Konstantinos-Orfeas Sotiriou*

 

Abstract: The phenomenon of antiquities smuggling is a complicated issue. 
The lack of official data makes it difficult to do an integrated analysis of the 
problem. The aim of this article is to present an accurate view of antiquities 
smuggling in the recent past. After gaining official permission from the Greek 
police, we examined 246 official arrests made by the Greek Department against 
Antiquities Smuggling (Athens Office) that occurred between 1999 and 2009. 
First and foremost, our results revealed that many arrests showed instances of 
fake antiquities. Moreover, it seems that there is a connection between organized 
crime and antiquities forgery. In addition, people with higher status are more 
often involved in antiquities forgery. With respect to the stolen objects, coins 
were by far the most preferred objects when it comes to forgery, and forgers are 
also using mostly bronze when it comes to these forgeries. Antiquity looting 
seems to have many hidden aspects, and the varied natured of antiquities 
smuggling requires the cooperation of a range of competent authorities and an 
in-depth investigation of the data, which should be based on the principles of the 
scientific method.

Keywords: looting, antiquity smuggling, organized crime, fake antiquities,

are  destroying  cultural  heritage  of  significant  importance.3  This  devastation  has 
many  consequences.  The  greatest  of  all  is  the  loss  of  ancient  artifacts  by  which 
researchers  may  interpret  the  working  of  ancient  societies.4  Beside  these  conse-
quences, many researchers have pointed out the connection of smuggling with the 
rise of organized crime. The involvement of criminal networks in antiquities loot-
ing  is  the  most  dangerous  consequence,  by  far,  of  the  smuggling  phenomenon. 
Many researchers have devoted much energy and thought to this subject. However, 
comparatively  little  effort  has  been  put  into  the  study  of  forgeries,  although 
the  smuggling  of  antiquities  also  includes  fakes  and  forgeries.5  Individuals  and 
museums in the Western world are hungry for ancient artifacts,6 especially from 
countries  with  a  long  and  rich  cultural  heritage.7  This  appetite  provides  a  great 
opportunity and motivation for people and networks, in these source countries, to 
devote time and money to creating fake objects, which eventually are sold abroad. 
This article presents the results of an integrated study on forgeries as part of major-
scale research project on the illicit trade of antiquities in Greece.

HISTORY OF FAKES

Fake archaeological objects have a long history.8 There are many stories and cases 
centered on fake antiquities and fraudulent sales. In some cases, the deceived were 
famous museums9 and, in other cases, people, even ones with good archaeological 
experience.10 Forgeries were used as the fundamental element for the construction 
of the distorted perception of the world on matters to do with ancient religion.11 
The rising demand for the export of artifacts, mostly from countries with a rich 
cultural  heritage,  both  by  individual  buyers  and/or  museums,  also  affects  the 
manufacturing of fakes. So large was the demand for Cycladic figures12 in the late 
twentieth century13 that now a vast number of them are without provenience,14 
and, in the majority of cases, they are probably fakes. Often, perhaps more in the 
past, museum curators and, more generally even now, individual buyers do not 
care about matters of provenience, and, eventually, this apathy encourages the 
mass creation of forgeries.15

RESEARCH

Archaeologists and researchers have pointed out the problems that impede a com-
prehensive review of the antiquities-smuggling phenomenon. The problem usu-
ally relates to available data of quality.16 After gaining a special permit from the 
Greek police headquarters (Permit no. 2565/15/528492) and taking account of the 
Greek Law on Sensitive Personal Data Information,17 a vast number of files from 
the Department against Antiquities Smuggling of the Greek Police (Athens office) 
were examined. The main aim was to make a broad study of the smuggling phe-
nomenon with respect to forgeries. Work was conducted using the definitions set 
out in the Greek Law 3028/2002 on Antiquities,18 with the later Law 3658/2008 on 
Measures for the Protection of Cultural Objects classifying forgery as a crime,19 
although not a particularly serious one, it would seem, and setting out the penalties 
for those caught trying to sell fake artifacts as originals. Article 10 of Law 3658/2008 
declares a two-year prison sentence for those who import, export, hold casts, copy 
fakes and try to pass them off for sale as genuine. The authorities rely on these two 
laws to arrest smugglers and people who have made the forgeries.

DATA AND METHODOLOGY

The study reviewed 246 arrests in Greece spread between the years 1999 and 2009. All 
of these arrests and confiscations presented a great opportunity to study a number 
of  important  details  surrounding  the  manufacturing  of  fake  antiquities  and  the 
phenomenon in general as well. For a more sensitive understanding, two different 
categories, based on the confiscated context, were created. The first category refers 
to cases where the confiscated material included genuine antiquities that had been 
looted, alongside forgeries.20 The second category refers to cases where only fakes/
forgeries were concerned. In these latter cases, the authorities had to deal not with the 
looters but, rather, with the people trying to sell the fake objects as originals.

RESEARCH AIM

The  aim  of  this  research  was  first  to  examine  how  frequently  fake  antiquities 
appeared in these 246 arrests, noting the frequency of the appearance of only fake 
antiquities and then of fake antiquities alongside genuine antiquities. In addition, 
the goal was to examine the types of antiquities that were usually copied and to 
which period they belonged, the involvement of organized crime in these activities, 
and, finally, the social profile of all of the arrested people.

KONSTANTINOS-ORFEAS SOTIRIOU

RESULTS

In summary, 36 of the 246 arrests showed instances of fake antiquities. In 29 of these 
cases, smugglers had also looted or stolen genuine artifacts—smuggled out from 
archaeological sites—with the purpose of selling them. In the remaining seven cases, 
the arrested people had only fake artifacts and were intending to sell them as genuine. 
For the accurate reckoning of all of the objects, five categories were devised. The first 
category concerns fake coins, the second marble heads of statues, the third vessels 
made of clay and/or metals. The fourth category includes jewelry of precious metals 
such as silver, gold, and bronze and, finally, the fifth concerns idols made of clay, 
stone/marble, or bronze. The confiscated fake artifacts are outlined in Table 1.

The cases/arrests were an excellent opportunity to study in depth the situation 
with respect to fake antiquities. Not only was it possible to make a comprehensive 
list of the types of antiquities usually produced to defraud potential buyers, but it 
was also possible to go beyond this list because the official files contained crucial 
details about the phenomenon. In 29 of the 36 arrests, the looters had genuine 
antiquities, which had been illegally extracted from archaeological sites, plus fake 
antiquities. Thus, 80.55 percent of all of the cases combined fake antiquities with 
genuine ones. The remaining seven cases had only fake antiquities, which equals 
19.45 percent. A more detailed breakdown of the objects and categories that were 
encountered during our research is shown in Table 2.

Of the seized forgeries, there were 6,209 coins, 152 idols, eight vessels, seven marble 
heads of statues, and, finally, only two pieces of jewelry, equalling a total of 6,378 objects.

FROM WHAT PERIOD OF ANTIQUITY ARE ITEMS MOST OFTEN 

COPIED?

When  forgers  and  smugglers  tried  to  copy  and/or  present  artifacts  to  potential 
buyers, they often relate them to some period or other of the ancient world. Of the 
total 6,378 objects involved, 3,913 of them (mostly coins) did not match the period 
to which they belonged. Therefore, these items were excluded from the following 
account about the types of objects based in a particular ancient period. In total, 
1,433 objects were imitations of objects related to the Classical period (58.13 percent); 
972 objects were objects related to the Hellenistic period (39.43 percent); 45 objects 
were related to the Roman period (1.82 percent), and five to the Byzantine period 
(0.32 percent). Five objects were imitations vaguely related to somewhere between 
the Neolithic and late Bronze Age (0.20 percent), and, finally, there was just one 
object that was a New Hittite imitation (0.040 percent).

WHAT OBJECTS WERE OFTEN COPIED?

Obviously coins are by far the preferred object when it comes to forgery. In total, 
6,209 coins were confiscated during the arrests: of which 1,291 were Classical

imitations (1,284 bronze, five silver, and two golden); 967 coins were Hellenis-
tic imitations (904 silver, 57 bronze, and 6 golden); 45 coins were Roman copies 
(25 bronze, 15 silver), and, finally, only four bronze coins (made of bronze) were 
Byzantine imitations. In addition, 3,907 bronze coins had no further description 
assigned to them. Idols, made both of marble/stone and/or bronze were the sec-
ond most common object to be involved in fraudulent activity. In total, out of 
the 152 idols, 140 were Classical imitations (27 made of clay, 76 made of bronze, 
and 37 made of marble); five idols were Hellenistic imitations made of clay, and  
another five were imitations belonging anywhere between the Neolithic period to 
the Late Bronze Age (one made of bronze, four made of stone/marble). Finally, 
there existed one bronze Roman imitation and one bronze imitation of the New 
Hittite period. Out of the eight metal vessels, five were made of bronze with no 
further description about the period they were imitating, and two were from the 
Byzantine period and made of gold. There also existed one vessel made of clay, 
with no further description as to its chronology. Fake marble heads of statues do 
occur. Of the seven that were retrieved, two were Classical imitations, four were 
Roman,  and  one  had  no  further  description.  For  jewelry,  which  was  the  least 
common category for smugglers/forgers, just one pair of items was represented: one 
was from the Byzantine period, made of bronze, and one was from the Byzantine 
period, made of gold.

MATERIALS OF THE FAKE OBJECTS

The materials that the forgers used in their efforts to create fake antiquities can be 
broken down as follows: 5,362 objects were made of bronze; 924 objects of silver; 
48 objects of marble/stone; 33 objects of clay, and, finally, 11 objects were made 
of gold (see Table 3).

PREFERENCES

Even if it is extremely difficult to point to the preferences in antiquities smuggling 
in general, besides the preference for the small size of the objects,21 it seems easy

enough to spot one special and preferred ancient artifact, namely coins. The Classical 
period is often seen as the golden period for ancient Greek culture, and, thus, 
it is not surprising that the vast majority of the fake coins were trying to imitate 
coins from this particular era. It seems that it is relatively easy or safe for forgers, 
in their efforts for profit, to copy ancient Greek coins of this period—thus, all 
told, the vast majority of the fakes were from the Classical period.22 Moreover, it 
is the bronze Classical coins that are most often targeted since the ancient city-
states all over the Mediterranean minted excellent coins of this material. Since the 
Hellenistic period was one of great wealth, thanks to the spoils looted from the  
Persian east by Alexander the Great, the successor kingdoms minted excellent 
golden and silver coins for their citizens, and, thus, forgers have tried to create 
more Hellenistic coins made of silver than any other material. Roman and Byzantine 
coins were too few to reveal what, if any, patterns of choice were operating in this 
category. Most of these confiscations were made at major tourist destinations, such 
as Santorini and Delphi; every year, thousands of tourists visit these archaeological 
sites, and it can be safely assumed that the fake coins were intended to be sold to 
tourists (see Table 4).

ORGANIZED CRIME

Further analysis, based on the details of these official files, was conducted into the 
role played by organized crime in these transactions. A thorough examination 
showed that in at least 13 cases out of 36 (36.11 percent), the crimes had all of the 
essential details to be characterized as “organized,” according to European23 and 
Greek law.24 In many cases, the authorities were unable to arrest all of the partici-
pants, and, hence, these crimes were not officially labeled as being organized in the 
court hearings. A closer examination of the arrest files, however, revealed crucial 
details, and, thus, here at least they may be termed organized crime cases. These 
crucial details included the existence of a team for illegal purposes, the allocation 
of duties among the members, the involvement/corruption of the public sector,

SOCIAL PROFILE OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ANTIQUITIES FORGERY

The social profile of the people involved in cases of antiquities forgery was some-
thing that, from the very start of this research, excited interest and was one of the 
main goals of the project since a better understanding was deemed vital. An inte-
grated piece of recent research has already proven the involvement of people with 
a higher status in antiquities looting activity,26 so the social profile of the arrested 
people in cases that involved forgeries was a natural extension and so was subjected 
to a similar scrutiny. For better understanding this aspect of the research, 10 cate-
gories were determined based on occupation:
 
	 •	 	business,	including	businessmen	in	general,	merchants,	and	jewelers;
	 •	 	freelance	 work,	 including	 a	 great	 variety	 of	 occupations	 such	 as	 drivers,	
hairdressers, bakers, car engineers, electricians, butchers, plumbers, economists, 
carpenters, coffeemakers, pastry cooks, writers, and sound technicians;

	 •	 	private	 sector,	 including	 private	 employees	 in	 general,	 bank	 employees,	 and	

guards;

	 •	 	public	sector,	including	public	sector	employees	in	general,	doctors,	policemen,	

university professors, customs clearers, and kindergarten teachers;

	 •	 	agricultural	sector,	such	as	farmers,	cheese	makers,	small	land	owners,	cattlemen,	

and small animal industrial workers;

	 •	 	archaeology	 and	 fine	 art	 sector,	 including	 archaeologists,	 gallery	 owners,	

lithographers, musicians, sculptors, musicians, and conservationists;

	 •	 	construction	 sector,	 including	 people	 working	 in	 the	 construction	 industry,	
such as civil engineers, workers, construction company employees, excavation 
machine drivers, gaffers, smiths, real estate employees, and builders;

	 •	 	maritime	activities,	such	as	sailors	and	fishermen;
	 •	 	individuals	with	unknown	occupations;	and
	 •	 	other,	which	included	out	of	the	ordinary	occupations	that	did	not	readily	fit

retirees.

 
It is clear from these findings that there has been a greater involvement of busi-
nesspeople and people with a higher status, and probably money and resources, 
in the forgery of antiquities. However, aside from businessmen, it is quite clear, 
and, to that extent, interesting, that people from all ranks of society are likely to be 
involved. People such as students, policemen, doctors, construction workers, real 
estate agents, public sector employees, freelancers, and so on are all participating 
in forgery and its promotion. The diversity of the involved people makes the pre-
vention  and  detection  of  the  phenomenon  difficult  since  the  authorities  must 
potentially confront every member of society (see Table 6)!

CONCLUSION

In a financial world of many disturbances, risks, and uncertainties, the antiq-
uities and archaeological artifacts market is a relatively low risk business in terms 
of investment for bona fide buyers and responsible museums.27 But hundreds of 
numismatic sites all over the world are selling thousands of ancient coins every 
year, smuggled out of many countries.28 Individual buyers are willing to pay great

amounts for such antique objects. The tremendous number of fake objects involved 
in this one study—6,343—of which the vast majority were coins, highlights that 
this problem is significant and also has some intrinsic financial magnitude, which 
would  benefit  from  further  investigation.  The  high  percentage  of  the  cases  that 
involved genuine antiquities (80.55 percent) alongside fake ones reveals that it is a 
profitable action that is attractive to both organized crime members (36.11 percent) 
and single individuals from all over the social web. Genuine antiquities are the 
bait for potential buyers, while the fake antiquities provide the real profit for their 
forgers. The sheer number of fakes is sufficient, if not fully identified, to obscure 
and distort scientific research on antiquities. Misleading results, as has happened in 
the past, may be the outcome. In particular, this “coin fever” is responsible for the 
vast number of fake coins, which this examination makes abundantly plain. Small 
in size, not so easily identified as fakes by potential buyers, and easy to transport 
without correct permission from the authorities, coins make the ideal objects to 
operate in. It is not surprising then that they total 6,209 pieces in the research. By 
compiling and assessing all of these different aspects from the police files, a unique 
opportunity to correlate and examine them emerged, shedding some light onto the 
various aspects of the forging and smuggling phenomenon. The significantly small 
(or insignificant) penalty for forgery is responsible, in the researchers’ opinion, for 
the large-scale involvement of people from all levels of society. While the forgery of 
antiquities seems harmless compared to the looting and smuggling of antiquities, 
the profits accruing from such actions is sufficient to attract gangs and organized 
crime members and, in this way, can destabilize any society.
