Embracing an IP strategy amid WTO compliance
Kong Qingjiang*

With China’s entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in December 2001, IP rights (IPR) became an
increasingly important
topic. So far, much public
attention to IPR has focused on counterfeit goods,
pirate software, and movies. However,
in the future
one can expect the discussion to shift from consumer
goods to higher value-added goods such as advanced
technology. After all, China is the world’s largest recipi-
ent of foreign direct investment, at over US$80 billion
in 2008, and technology transfers alone constituted
almost one-ﬁfth of
the
Chinese government is determined to embrace an IPR
strategy to lay the foundation for a knowledge-based
economy. The emergence of this IPR strategy is the
most noteworthy development in the ﬁeld of IPR in
post-WTO China.

this amount. On its part,

The idea of implementing an IPR strategy was ﬁrst
put forward by the Jiu San (September 3) Society, one
of China’s eight non-communist parties at the annual
conference of the Chinese People’s Political Consulta-
tive Conference (CPPCC) in 2003.1 According to Wu
Boming, who made the proposal to the CPPCC on
behalf of the Jiu San Society, the creation, possession,
and exploitation of IPR has become indispensable from
the perspective of an enterprise or even a nation in
competition. The idea resonated among China’s enter-
prises, intellectuals, and government ofﬁcials and was
ﬁnally accepted by the State Intellectual Property Ofﬁce
(SIPO) as the ofﬁcial policy.2 In June 2005, the Leading
Group for the Work on the Formulation of the State
Intellectual Property Rights Strategy was established to
formulate an IPR strategy and the then Deputy Prime
Minister Wu Yi was made Head of Leading Group.3
Accordingly, the IPR strategy was raised the state level.
On 15 October 2007, the 17th Congress of the Com-
munist Party of China (CPC) endorsed the concept of

implementing a state IPR strategy.4 On 5 June 2008,
the State Council promulgated the Guidelines of the

Why is China formulating an IPR
strategy?
The increasing importance of IPR in global
competition
Intellectual creations have gained increasing import-
ance in the context of the knowledge-based economy,
particularly in promoting technological innovation and
social and economic growth.

The rather tangled history of Sino-US trade nego-
tiations over IPR matters and the central role that IPR
played during the negotiations leading to the last
round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) are well-known examples of the increasing
importance of IPR on the world economic scene.

In a word, while the need for IPR on the part of
government arises from the social objective of promot-
ing the creation of new types of information to add to

the existing knowledge base and the creation of
markets to stimulate initiatives in intellectual creation,
enterprises are given the legal ability to set the terms
on which their IPR may be used. Moreover, as a mon-
opoly by nature, IPR has become an important insti-
tutional tool for companies to create market share and
market value. In fact, in today’s competitive environ-
ment, IPR is a signiﬁcant factor in almost every com-
pany’s ability to vie for existence and development.

Lessons taught within the international
community
In the past two decades, two key events had a lasting
impression on China. The ﬁrst is that the Uruguay
Round included IPR for the ﬁrst time in the history of
the multilateral trading system. IPR remained central
throughout the negotiation process of the Uruguay
Round. The second is the United States’ forceful en-
forcement of US IPR in China and constant exertion of
pressure on China to institutionalize an IPR regime of
a higher standard of protection. These two events high-
light the importance of IPR in the eyes of the devel-
oped economies. It is no exaggeration to say that the
two events had been a rude awakening for China.

Response to IPR-based competition from
multinational corporations
It is well perceived that powerful foreign rivals, with
advanced technologies
and optimized-management
models, may plot against domestic manufacturers by
all means in order to grab as much market share as
possible. Given its monopolistic nature, IPR is an excel-
lent, if not the best, means available to multinational
corporations. China’s enterprises have been increasingly
involved in assertion of IPR by multinational corpor-
ations, where IPR holders press for enforcement either
through direct face-to-face confrontation, by escalating
into administrative remedy, or even through litigation.
Moreover, domestic manufacturers’
lack of concern
over IPR often leaves them at a disadvantage when
facing such claims. In the face of foreign IPR hege-
mony, a sense of grievance and even of nationalism
emerged among some enterprises. As a result, the per-
ception that multinational corporations are taking
advantage of IPR to restrain unfairly their competitors

in China is gaining momentum among China’s enter-
prises, intellectuals, and government agencies.

Take China’s motorcycle manufacturers, who face
strong foreign challenges in IPR cases, despite their
dominance in the Southeast Asian market. Japanese
motor companies have experienced a shrinking of
their market share in China’s motorcycle market.6
They attributed this decline to imitation products
from China7 and as expected, took whatever action
is permissible under the IPR framework.
In 2003,
Japan’s Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd won an RMB900, 000
(US$109, 000) court judgment against Tianjin Gang-
tian after accusing the Chinese company of producing
and selling copies of its motorcycles. That was one of
the largest settlements in a Chinese copyright infringe-
ment case. Tianjin Gangtian was also ordered to stop
making motorcycles under Yamaha’s name, and to
apologize through local newspapers to Yamaha.

IPR dispute
between ‘New Oriental School’ and Educational Testing
Services (ETS) is such an example. This copyright
dispute erupted as early as 1996. The ETS complained
to China’s concerned departments that the New Orien-
tal School, a successful English Training Centre, illegally
used copyright exam materials. After the latter sincerely
apologized, ETS offered limited cooperation by legally
authorizing New Oriental School to use its TOEFL
exam materials. However, the ETS was unhappy with
New Oriental School for repeated copyright infringe-
ment in the years that followed and thus deferred any
decision regarding authorization of New Oriental
School to use its GRE exam materials. To the dismay of
ETS, New Oriental School was found to be using,
copying, and selling ETS’s
copyright GRE exam
materials without permission. In 2002, the impatient
ETS ﬁled a lawsuit against the New Oriental School for
damages of RMB30 million. In September 2003, New
Oriental School was ordered by No. 1 Intermediate
People’s Court to compensate ETS and the Graduate
Management Admission Commission to the value of
RMB10 million and to surrender all the infringing
materials to the Court for destruction.

The lawsuit was given wide media coverage and was
interpreted as being intended to penalize China’s stu-
dents. ETS had to release a statement which said that it

6 Honda’s motorcycle sales last year in China dropped 27 per cent, whereas

Yamaha’s sales plunged 49 per cent, said an ofﬁcial with Honda’s Beijing
ofﬁce.

7 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) statistics

indicate that China produces about 11 million motorcycles annually, 9
million of which are imitations of Japanese products. About 2 million of

the imitation motorcycles are exported to Asian nations, and some are
sold with only the trade marks changed. A Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC, later reorganized into the
‘Ministry of Commerce’) ofﬁcial commenting on Japan’s statistics
dismissed it as ‘totally groundless’.

its copyrights on its exam materials, which is also
essential to the integrity of the examination system and
the university admissions process. In no way is the

students but
instead is an effort to protect them. Nor was this an
attack targeted against New Oriental School or the
websites. It was only the engagement of the rule of law
to stop copyright infringement and piracy. ETS has
always attached great importance to the protection of
copyrights and the interests of copyright owners. As a
result, ETS decided to address this copyright infringe-
ment problem through legal channels.8

Intriguingly, the two parties have continued to have
some form of cooperation with each other even since
the ﬁrst copyright dispute arose. A reasonable expla-
nation is economic beneﬁt. The New Oriental School is
not only a competitor but also a collaborator with ETS
vis-a`-vis International English Language Testing System
(IELTS). The latter is therefore reluctant to abandon
New Oriental School on account of
its substantial
inﬂuence and rich experience in administering TOEFL,
GRE, and GMAT in China. As a partner, New Oriental
School has successfully built up conﬁdence among
Chinese students, and applicant numbers for the exams
increase each year. All these have practically extended
ETS’ market share in China. ETS surely has no inten-
tion of ﬁnishing New Oriental School off with a single
blow, but rather seeks further control of it in order to
achieve greater market share instead of being replaced
by other adversaries such as the IELTS.9

Quite a few multinational corporations have ﬁled
patent applications with the SIPO. Reportedly more
than 90 per cent of the patents in the telecommunica-
tions and semi-conductor industry, around 90 per cent
in the biological industry, and some 70 per cent in
pharmaceutical
industry and computer industry are
owned by foreign companies.10 Some multinational

In the view of some of China’s enterprises, the IPR

China
In addition to the
approaches mentioned above, the IPR strategy can also
occur in disguised forms, among which is to undertake
a joint effort with other companies to create a new
standard with a shared IPR pool that can be licensed
out or to create a technical standard.14 As the creator
of the technical standard of the core business oper-
ations of an industry, a multinational corporation is in
a unique position either to force an enterprise in China
to use the standard to the advantage of, inter alia, the
multinational corporation or to dictate the terms of
cooperation between it and the Chinese enterprise. By
seeking IPR-backed opportunities in the China market,
certain multinational corporations have already turned
the exploitation of technical standards into a lucrative
revenue stream.

Upon the challenge by the three Chinese companies, the SIPO’s Patent
Re-examination Board re-examined the patents and announced in
September 2001 that Honda’s patent on the invention was asserted, but
that its patent on the industrial design was invalid because a patent had
already been issued for a similar design. On 25 July 2002, Honda ﬁled a
petition through the courts to have the invention patent reconﬁrmed,
arguing that the SIPO wrongfully rescinded the patent. On 25 September
2002, Beijing No 1 Intermediate People’s Court dismissed the case against
Honda.

conditions dictated by the latter.

taken will cause serious damage to the competitors or
even force them into a corner.15

With the IPR strategy of multinational corporations
in place, China’s enterprises now incur considerable
costs,
in time and money, determining how to do
research without infringing other companies’ patent
rights.16 This gives rise to the question of whether the
substantial costs involved in patent searching, analysis,
and litigation are a necessary price to pay for the incen-
tives offered by China’s new patent system, or whether
ways can be found to reduce them. The IPR strategy of
the multinational corporations has, however, served to
prompt China’s competitors
to change how they
develop their products.

The perception of some of China’s enterprises, intel-
lectuals, and government ofﬁcials that multinational
corporations have taken advantage of
their IPR to
squeeze the market share of China’s companies has
something to do with the fact that there is no clearly
deﬁned competition law. Accordingly, it is difﬁcult to
differentiate between a monopolistic act and an act of
IPR self-protection.

The pressure for domestic enterprises to resort to an
IPR strategy not only comes from abroad but also from
within China, as domestic competition intensiﬁes.
However, it is fair to say that IPR-based competition
from the multinational corporations is the primary
motivating factor behind the move to embrace an IPR
strategy in China.

Inspiration from IPR Strategies from USA and Japan
The USA and Japan are pursuing an IPR strategy in
their economic restructuring and particularly in its
foreign trade relations. The US Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce (USPTO) adopted the 21st Century Strategic
Plan in 2002 (revised in February 2003). The ﬁve-year
Strategic Plan is basically
self-enabling plan,
transforming the USPTO into ‘a
with the aim of

a

quality-focused, highly productive, responsive organiz-
ation supporting a market-driven intellectual property
system’.

In July 2003, the Intellectual Property Strategy Pro-
gramme was formally implemented in Japan.17 Com-
pared with the US strategy, Japan’s IPR strategy is more
comprehensive, covering not only capacity-building on
the part of the government IPR agency but also the
policy priorities towards IPR-oriented innovations and
their application. The Japanese strategy aims to make
Japan ‘a Nation Built on Intellectual Property’. In other
words, its objective is to enhance Japan’s international
competitiveness.

While the US strategy focuses on improving the efﬁ-
ciency of patenting and trademarking, Japan’s strategy
covers the whole cycle of intellectual creation: the cre-
ation, the protection, and the exploitation of IPR. It
even extends to the obligations of the central govern-
ment, of the Prefectures, of the cities, of the univer-
sities, and of the enterprises. As part of the Strategy,
Japan is stepping up measures to counter counterfeiting
globally.18

Both the USA and Japan are well ahead of China in
terms of the level of innovation. Their pursuit of an
IPR strategy not only serves as a warning but also as a
source of inspiration to China’s innovation drive.

‘Integrating Intellectual Property Rights

In this regard, a report of the UK’s Commission on
Intellectual Property Rights (CIPR) has special impact
on China’s decision to embrace an IPR strategy. As the
title
and
Development Policy’ reveals, the Report of the CIPR in
September 2002 is development oriented. The report
can be seen as advocating an IPR strategy, of which the
primary purpose is
IPR
regimes could be best designed to beneﬁt developing
countries within the international agreements, includ-
ing the TRIPS’, thus distinguishing the strategies of
both the USA and Japan.

15 For example, the DVD 6C Licensing Agency, representing the six leading

developers of DVD technology and formats—Hitachi, Ltd, Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co., Ltd, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Time
Warner Inc., Toshiba Corporation, and Victor Company of Japan, Ltd
(JVC)—took no countermeasures in the face of what was later called
piracy on the part of Chinese DVD manufacturers until 2002 when China
had put in place an IPR regime of high standard in its effort to comply
with the WTO commitments and when China had begun exporting DVD
players. In 2002, the DVD 6C Licensing Agency launched a
comprehensive attack against Chinese manufacturers of DVD players.
Among other things, they petitioned the EU customs to detain DVD
players of Chinese origin on the ground of suspected IPR infringement
and forced Chinese manufacturers to agree to become licensed under the
DVD 6C patents on or before 30 June 2002 and to pay royalty for DVD-
Video players for the use of end-users in China at a standard rate of 4%
of the net selling price of the player, or US$4.00 per player, whichever is
greater. China’s manufacturers thought the multinational corporations

behind the DVD 6C Licensing Agency were taking the measures only to
stop their China counterparts from exporting.

16 An example is that a well-established research institute spent 4 years and
CNY25 million on a project which turned out to have repeated what had
been done by a multinational corporation, in that the international
company technology had patented the technology (W Jingchuan,
interviewed by China News Agency on 13 January 2004).

17 In February 2002, Prime Minister Koizumi made a policy statement. In

March 2002, the Strategic Council on Intellectual Property was
established, which published in July 2002 the Intellectual Property Policy
Outline. The Basic Law of Intellectual Property was passed in November
2002. In March 2003, the Intellectual Property Strategy Headquarters
were established, comprising all the ministers and 10 experts led by the
Prime Minister as the Chairman.

Growing IPR awareness in China
IPR awareness in China is growing in part as a result of
nurturing.19 IPR awareness not only relates to the legal
consciousness of IPR but also to the importance of
IPR strategy in global competition. Although China’s
competitiveness in the ﬁeld of IPR lags far behind
developed countries, some of China’s enterprises are
becoming aware that only self-owned IPR can empower
them in their competition with multinational corpor-
ations equipped with technological advantages. Some of
China’s companies have even taken measures to secure
international innovation resources, while others have
begun forging a strategic cooperation in innovation
activities.20

All

the above factors contribute to a sense of

urgency of embracing an IPR strategy in China.

2. What is the Chinese IPR strategy
about?
The Guidelines of the State Intellectual Property Rights
Strategy outline the key elements of
the state IPR
strategy.

First, the issue of IPR is dealt with from ‘the height
of a national strategy’. In other words, the IPR strategy
is part of the national development strategy.

Secondly, the IPR strategy is to consummate IPR
legislation in China in the next 5– 10 years with an
emphasis on the enforcement of IPR. Improving IPR-
related policies, laws, and regulations is made part of
the strategy.21

Thirdly,

the IPR strategy aims

to increase the
number of patents in China, to match other major
global economies, and to study and implement the IPR
strategy in selected ﬁelds.

foreign equipment vendors must

The strategy is supplemented by IPR tactics such as
the setting of technical standards. For example, the
Standardization Administration
(SAC)
approved early in May 2003 the Chinese WLAN stan-
dard, which came into effect on 1 December 2003,
although a transition period has been initially granted
that extend the compliance deadline for some WLAN
products until 1 June 2004 and its implementation was
later postponed ‘for an unlimited period’ under tre-
mendous pressure from the US side.22 On account of
this standard, equipment vendors that want to sell
WLAN gear in China are required to offer products
based on the Chinese standard. To conform to this
standard,
license
WAPI through a manufacturing agreement with 1 of 11
Chinese companies designated by the government,
including Legend Group Ltd and Huawei Technologies
Co. Ltd. The Chinese companies—many of which
compete against foreign equipment vendors—are not
under any obligation to license WLAN to foreign com-
panies, who could ﬁnd themselves
locked out of
China’s WLAN market if they cannot reach an agree-
ment with a local partner. While China’s companies
that get WAPI licensed may demand detailed access to
foreign companies’ products and technologies, raising
concerns about the protection of IPR, the implemen-
tation of the Chinese WLAN standard, and its licensing
requirements would fundamentally change a market
that had previously been open to foreign equipment
vendors by creating a new barrier to trade. The require-
ment has also triggered worries among multinational
corporations that could undermine efforts to create a
global standard for wireless networks.

Fourthly, the strategy endorses the switch of inno-
vation modality from the imitation-oriented approach
to self-dependent
IPR-oriented one. Many Chinese
enterprises have relied on imitation of imported pro-
ducts and equipments for the technology acquisition.
The government reportedly plans to invest RMB20
billion to focus on innovation in 12 selected important
areas, aimed at achieving 2000 patents during the
‘Eleventh Five Year Plan’ period.

Lastly, the strategy encourages an active participation

patents.23 Through a Texas court, Cisco sought a per-
manent injunction to stop Huawei distributing versions
of its Quidway routers and servers. Market analysts
have speculated for some time that Cisco would take
the case to law because of
the similarity between
Huawei’s products and their own. Chinese market ana-
lysts, however, see the move as a more cynical protec-
tion strategy aimed at defending Cisco’s global markets.
Huawei is offering similar products at lower prices in
overseas markets where Cisco has enjoyed market dom-
inance. The lawsuit is therefore seen in China as a rec-
ognition of how far Huawei has come to constitute a
real threat to Cisco. According to the latest market stat-
istics, Huawei appears to be stealing some of Cisco’s
thunder. Huawei has reportedly captured 13 per cent of
the global market for next-generation voice products,
with over 4 million ports shipped to date.

Cisco claimed that portions of Huawei’s source code
are so similar to its own that even text strings, ﬁle
names, and bugs are identical. Cisco also accused
Huawei of infringing at least ﬁve of its patents related
to proprietary routing protocols.

After months of denying any wrongdoing, Huawei
admitted in late March that an employee had copied 2
per cent of the router operating software from Cisco
but insisted that the company did not know of the vio-
lation. In June, a federal judge for the Eastern District
of Texas
issued a preliminary injunction, barring
Huawei from selling products that incorporated the
patent in dispute.

Cisco recently halted the suit pending an indepen-
dent review of Huawei products, after Huawei said that
it had changed its source code.

Now Huawei is back on the offensive, teaming up with
Microsoft in China, where the two ﬁrms will sell an inte-
grated package of next-generation network equipment
from Huawei coupled with Microsoft’s Exchange Server
2003. Dubbed U-SYS WorkSpace, the offering is aimed at
carriers looking to offer IP Centrex and other hosted IP
services like Microsoft Exchange. This is a very deliberate
strategy to buy legitimacy in the Western market. In
addition to the Microsoft deal, Huawei has struck a com-
mercial arrangement with 3Com Corp. Immediately after
the Texas judge’s June injunction, which covered only a
narrow range of products, 3Com ﬁled a motion to inter-
vene, petitioning the court to declare that products pro-
duced by the joint venture between itself and Huawei did
not infringe Cisco’s patents.

between Huawei and Cisco’ in S Li (ed.) The Dispute between Huawei and
Cisco (China Yanshi Press Beijing 2003), 89 –105.

Case study 2: from DVD to EVD: DVD
manufacturers’ collective action
China makes up to roughly 70 per cent of home DVD
players in the world market, which reached the peak of
over 30 million sets in 2002. However, in the same
year, China’s DVD manufacturers encountered a crisis
overshadowing the prospect of the prospering industry.
The IPR holders, represented by 3C DVD Licensing
Group comprising multinational corporations such as
Philips, Sony, and Pioneer, claimed from Chinese man-
ufacturers royalties that accounted for a sizable portion
of their proﬁts. The harsh attitude of the IPR holders
left no doubt that they were employing the IPR strategy
to corner their Chinese counterparts. It occurred to
China’s DVD manufacturers, who were heavily depen-
dent on the multinational corporations, that they had
no choice other than to develop their own patented
technology to compete with the multinational corpor-
ations,
for by owning industry standard technology
they can not only avoid increasing licensing fees but
also license to and collect royalties from others.

As early as 1999, China began to develop its own
format
for video player products, which was later
called EVD (Enhanced Versatile Disc). However, it was
after the DVD ‘patent mania’ of 2002 that the EVD
standard acquired stronger government support in its
drive to reduce licence fee payments and shake off
dependence on foreign technologies in production.

According to the company developing EVD, Beijing
E-World Digital Technology that comprises government
bodies and 10 domestic electronics manufacturers, the
new format promises ﬁve times the image quality of
DVD movies and a higher computer data-storage
capacity. However, the EVD standard seems to be quite
costly: it will be playable only on EVD players, which
will cost about US$240, compared with around US$85
for the average cost of a domestic DVD player. It does
not appear to be a user-recordable format for now, and
aims to complement the DVD movie format for those
with high-deﬁnition TVs. Prospective EVD manufac-
turers will have to rely on ﬁlm distributors to introduce
content on EVD. Moreover, competitors outside China
have developed similar high-capacity optical disc
formats in order to push DVD technology forward.
Japanese electronics giants Toshiba and NEC,
for
example, have had their next-generation DVD standard
approved by
an international

association of electronics makers and movie studios,
just weeks after China clariﬁed its own EVD format.

EVD will meet a huge market challenge, although
the EVD developer claimed that it would represent the
new industry standard. It has thus been proposed that
to help the developer of the EVD standard, the govern-
ment should adopt the EVD standard as a compulsory
standard,
corporations
including the manufacturers and ﬁlm distributors have
to adapt to this standard in order to tap the Chinese
market.

so that

In the current international DVD market, the com-
petition for technology standards has been far more
severe than the competition for sales.24 In the attempt
to evolve from DVD player manufacturers to EVD
standard setters, Chinese DVD manufacturers have
clearly shown that they are not content with being a
major manufacturer; they will not only compete on
prices, but have also start competing over DVD tech-
nology standards.

Case study 3: Motorcycle manufacturers in
Chongqing: from imitation to patent creation
China now possesses the world’s largest motorcycle
manufacturing industry, with an annual production
scale in the vicinity of 12 million units and exports of
2.9 million units. However, China’s motorcycle makers
are known for being quick to imitate25 and therefore
are often accused of
infringing foreign motorcycle
manufacturers’ industrial designs and trade marks.26

China’s motorcycle manufacturers are being urged to
develop new technologies and products with indepen-
dent IPR to ensure they survive cut-throat international
competition from multinational corporations.

Chongqing is China’s major motorcycle manufactur-
ing base, hosting big producers such as Zongshen,
Lifan, and Jialing. Chongqing has been a major target
of an IPR offensive by Japanese motorcycle manufac-
turers. The motorcycle manufacturers’ response to the
IPR strategy is quite illustrative of that of the motor-
cycle industry in China as a whole.

Zongshen ﬁled 72 patents in 2001, but this number
increased dramatically to 176 in 2002, a rise of 144 per
cent.27

Realizing that domestic manufacturers must end
their strategies of ‘cloning’ and ‘duplicating’ motor-
cycles if they are going to beat international ﬁrms
under the WTO’s rules, Jialing Group has invested 4
per cent of total sales on technology innovation and its
new product sales account for 39 per cent of this com-
pany’s total sales in 2002.28

Lifan Industrial Group established an IPR depart-
ment in October 2002. It has developed more than 110
motorcycle engine types, 527 motorcycle disc catalo-
gues, 109 patents, 30 copyrights, and 45 registered
brands, thus positioning Lifan in the leading position
in the motorcycle industry of the country.29

The move of

in
Chongqing towards more IPR ownership exhibits the
new IPR strategy of China’s motorcycle industry.

4. What does the IPR Strategy imply?
Adopting an IPR strategy implies that China is willing
to draw lessons from the experience of other countries
and to beneﬁt
international
organizations and international ﬁrms in improving
IPR policy and IPR management
in an open and
increasingly globalized economy. It is known that the
strategy will take account of US and Japanese IPR
practices.30

from the expertise of

Embracing the IPR strategy also means that China
needs to review the current or envisaged IPR reforms
in this country, and assist
in the development of
institutional,
legal, and regulatory IPR frameworks,
including those related to the enhancement of IPR
protection that are required for China to meet the
challenges and opportunities
following the WTO
entry.

It was made clear from the outset that the strategy
would also be compatible with the TRIPS Agreement.31
For multinational corporations, however,
the IPR
strategy is not free from worries. For example, the
strategy will require governments at various levels to
offer preferential policies to encourage inventors to set
up small- and medium-sized high-tech enterprises
based on their patents, and therefore may be discrimi-
natory to foreign companies. Like other IPR strategies
in other countries, the Chinese IPR strategy, to the

32 According to the US Trade Representative, ‘China’s mandatory new

encryption standard for wireless networking products would make China
the only WTO member to introduce such a mandate for consumer
products—a restriction compounded by granting domestic companies
exclusive control over the technology’. There, in a letter of March 2004

addressed to the Chinese government, three senior US ofﬁcials, ie
Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans, Secretary of State Collin Powell,
and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, reportedly expressed the
concern. See http://www.inforworld.com/article/04/03/05/
