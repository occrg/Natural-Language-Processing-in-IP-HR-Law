Do copies made while browsing infringe?
Iona Silverman*

The decisions of the High Court for England and Wales
and then of the Court of Appeal in Newspaper Licensing
Agency Ltd and others v Meltwater Holding BV and
others1 that local copies made on a computer screen and
on a computer’s hard drive when browsing can infringe
copyright were bold and somewhat controversial.

The speciﬁc question of whether such local copies con-
stitute temporary copies for the purposes of Article 5(1)
of the Information Society Directive2 was appealed to the
Supreme Court.3 In contrast to the Court of Appeal, the
Supreme Court recognized the broad implications and
therefore the importance of the question, acknowledging
that a result which would make infringers of many mil-
lions of ordinary users of the internet was unacceptable.4
Given the transnational dimension of the issue, the
Supreme Court referred the question of
temporary
copies to the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU) for a preliminary ruling on the basis that the
issue was of such importance that it should be resolved
uniformly across the EU. The Supreme Court was not
without its own view, however. In his unanimously
agreed decision of 17 April 2013, Lord Sumption sets
out his conclusions on the effect of the Directive, as the
CJEU has interpreted and applied it to date. In his view,
both on-screen and cache copies made while browsing
should fall within the temporary copying exception.

The temporary copying exception
This case originated in the Copyright Tribunal when
news aggregator Meltwater applied to the Tribunal to
determine the reasonable terms of its licence with the
Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA). The NLA then
sued Meltwater and its users (represented by the Public
Relations Consultants Association Ltd (PRCA)) in the

that content and by reading the news articles on the

Since Meltwater had agreed to enter into a licence
with the NLA, the High Court granted a stay in relation
to the question of whether Meltwater infringed copy-
right by providing snippets of content to its users; only
issues relating to users reading content provided by
Meltwater proceeded. In particular, the PRCA disagreed
that its members infringed copyright by making local
on-screen and hard-drive copies of articles when reading
them online. It argued that these copies fell under the
temporary copying exception.

Iona Silverman . Do copies made while browsing infringe?

ARTICLE

Article 5(1) of the Information Society Directive5
creates an exception to Article 2 (the reproduction right)
for copies

which are transient or incidental [and] an integral and
essential part of a technological process and whose sole
purpose is to enable:

(a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an

intermediary, or

(b) a lawful use

of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which
have no independent economic signiﬁcance.

Recital 33 of the preamble to the Information Society
Directive states that the temporary copying exception
‘should include acts which enable browsing as well as
acts of caching to take place’ and that ‘a use should be
considered lawful where it is authorized by the right-
holder or not restricted by law’.

At ﬁrst instance in NLA v Meltwater, Proudman J said,
however, that ‘[a] person making a copy of a webpage on
his computer screen will not have a defence under s.28A
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 simply because
he has been browsing’,6 meaning that browsing is not
allowed unless the person browsing has permission to do
so from the owners of the content on the web pages
which they are viewing. In her view, the temporary
copies exception is solely concerned with incidental
and intermediate copying so that any copy which is
‘consumption of the work’, whether temporary or not,
requires the permission of the copyright holder. Further,
she held that the exception cannot have been intended to
legitimize all copies made in the course of browsing,
otherwise users would be permitted to watch pirated
ﬁlms and listen to pirated music. As the Supreme Court
clariﬁes at para 36 of its decision, legitimizing browsing
does not prevent rightsholders from taking action
against those who upload unauthorized content.

The Court of Appeal agreed, saying:

As is clear from a consideration of recital 33 as a whole, the
reference to ‘browsing’ is ‘to the extent that they meet these
conditions’. ‘They’ refers to the acts of reproduction. The
acts of reproduction are those occasioned by the voluntary
human process of accessing that webpage. Accordingly, they
fail to satisfy any of the conditions to which recital 33 refers.
S.28A does not provide even a limited defence to the claims

of infringement to which the business of Meltwater is likely
to give rise.7

The outcome was therefore that copies made when
browsing were infringing copies: unless consent was
given,
internet users infringed copyright by reading
material online.

It is a general principle of copyright law that con-
sumption of a work (for example reading a book) is per-
mitted, whereas reproduction (for example making a
copy of the whole or a substantial part of that book) is
permissible. Historically, restriction on consumption has
been limited to secondary infringement by possessing
illegal copies; a licence was not required in order to
merely consume a work. However, in the digital world,
local copies (including hard-drive and on-screen copies)
must be created in order to allow a user to read a web
page.

The Court of Appeal’s decision in NLA v Meltwater
in Infopaq)8
(combined with the CJEU’s judgment
moved the law towards allowing consumption on the
basis of permission,9 without considering the wider
impact
this might have on legitimate internet
browsing.

that

The decisions in NLA v Meltwater have been contro-
versial. Some found the Court of Appeal’s decision
disappointing, condemning it for failing to confront the
difﬁcult issues of law with which it was presented.10
Others have observed that the real point of the decisions
is to afﬁrm that the internet is not a copyright-free
space, and that technological inconvenience is no reason
for ignoring the rights of copyright owners online.11
The High Court and the Court of Appeal were keen to
protect rightsholders from piracy, which continues to be
a very real problem in the digital world where illegal
downloading and peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing are common-
place. The Supreme Court was clear however that the
application of
the temporary copying exception to
browsing is a distinct issue from that of online piracy.

Proposed legislative reform
The issue of whether browsing should explicitly be
made legal was considered in July last year by the House
of Commons in a public committee meeting on the

Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill.12 The following
proposed new section was debated:

30A Sharing and viewing on the internet

Where work is made available to the public at a particular
web address with the permission of the owner of the
copyright in that work, copyright shall not be infringed
by—

(a) any circulation of that web address, or of its title, or of

another web address that redirects to that web address;

(b) the downloading of any data required to display that
work at that address, and any subsequent processing of
that data, including processing for display, provided
that it does not result in any publication elsewhere
of the work or an adaptation of the work.

This provision would have made it clear that browsing
content which has been legitimately placed on a website
does not infringe copyright.

Labour MP Fiona O’Donnell said that ‘[i]t is evident
that the law has not caught up with new media and the
worldwide web, and the Government must respond.’
She then quoted Professor Lionel Bently, of Cambridge
University, who takes the rational view that ‘[t]here is
something fundamentally wrong with a legal regime
which renders the innocent acts of many millions of
citizens illegal.’13

Although Business Minister Norman Lamb had previ-
ously said that the copyright licensing system requires
modernization in order to be ﬁt for the 21st century, he
did not support O’Donnell’s argument in this instance,
saying that the issue of browsing had been dealt with in
NLA v Meltwater and that the Government should there-
fore await the outcome of the case in the Supreme Court
before passing any further legislation.

Ultimately no action was taken (only 6 of the 17
Committee members voted to pass the proposed s 30A)
as the Committee decided to wait for the Supreme
Court’s decision before passing any legislation. However,
the fact that the issue was debated at such a high level
conﬁrms its importance.

The Supreme Court’s decision
The Supreme Court recognized the public interest in the
question of whether copies made when browsing are
temporary, saying:

12 Public Bill Committee, Thursday 12 July 2012 (Afternoon), Graham Brady

in the Chair, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill.

13 Ibid.
14 [2013] UKSC 18, above, n 3, para 4.
15 Ibid, para 38.
16 Ibid, para 11.

The issue has reached this court because it affects the oper-
ation of a service which is being made available on a com-
mercial basis. But the same question potentially affects
millions of non-commercial users of the internet who may,
no doubt unwittingly, be incurring civil liability by viewing
copyright material on the internet without the authority of
the rights owner, for example because it has been unlawfully
uploaded by a third party.14

It was the far-reaching consequences, in particular the
transnational dimension of the issue and the fact that
the internet has become a basic technical facility used
by millions,15 which convinced the Supreme Court that
any decision on temporary copying should be referred to
the CJEU for a preliminary ruling so that the issue could
be resolved uniformly across the EU.

Despite referring the question of whether copies made
when browsing constitute copies which are (i) tempor-
ary, (ii) transient or incidental and (iii) an integral
and essential part of the technological process, for the
purposes of Article 5(1) of the Information Society
Directive, the Supreme Court was not without its own
opinion.

Before giving its view on each of the conditions of
Article 5(1), which it said should be read together as
they are overlapping and repetitive, as ‘each of them
colours the meaning of the others’,16 the CJEU gave a
helpful summary of the EU case law on Article 5(1):
namely Infopaq I,17 FAPL18 and Infopaq II.19

CJEU case law
Infopaq I
The Supreme Court ﬁrst considered the CJEU’s ap-
proach to the temporary copying exception in Infopaq I,
a case referred by the Danish courts. Infopaq is a news
aggregation service, which used a data capture process
involving the creation of copies at
four successive
stages: (i) the creation of a scanned image of the original
article, (ii) the conversion of that image into a searchable
text ﬁle, (iii) the extraction of the keywords from that
text ﬁle together with the ﬁve words on either side, and
their storage as a text ﬁle, and (iv) the printing out
and retention of copy (iii).

The issue in Infopaq I turned on the temporary or
transient character of copies made as part of this data
capture process. The CJEU held that Article 5(1) might

apply to scanned images, images converted into search-
able text ﬁles and keywords extracted from that text ﬁle,
if the Danish court was satisﬁed that these copies were
deleted automatically when the technical need for them
had passed. The CJEU held however that the printed
copies were not ‘transient’: they were destroyed only on
human intervention, i.e. when a person actively chose to
destroy them. The CJEU was of the view that the re-
quirement that the copying be an integral and essential
part of a technological process meant that it could only
be ‘temporary’ or ‘transient’ if it was inherent in the
technological process that the copy would be deleted
when that process was complete.

The CJEU also conﬁrmed that the temporary copying
exception applies to copies made for the sole purpose of
enabling a lawful use, and that internet browsing could
be a lawful use.20

FAPL
The fourth and ﬁfth conditions of Article 5(1) were ana-
lysed by the CJEU in FAPL. In this case the defendant,
Mrs Murphy was the owner of a pub. She had subscribed
to a television service in Greece, and used a Greek satellite
decoder to show football matches in her pub in the UK.
The temporary copies made in the memory of the
decoder and on the television screen in the course of the
streaming of the football matches were alleged to infringe
copyright. Although the facts of Infopaq I and NLA v
Meltwater are better aligned, because both cases relate to
news aggregation, the Supreme Court noted in NLA v
Meltwater that the decoder and screen copies in FAPL are,
in technically speaking, very similar to the hard-drive and
screen copies in issue in NLA v Meltwater. Another simi-
larity between NLA v Meltwater and FAPL is that the in-
fringement alleged was against consumption of a work—
reading an extract from an article or against watching a
football match. In FAPL the CJEU held that, while any ex-
ception from the right of the copyright owner to control
reproduction must be strictly construed, that right must
be balanced against the purpose of the exception, which
was to encourage the development and operation of new
technologies and the rights of users who wished to use
those technologies.21 It further held that the copies made

in the satellite decoder and on television screens fulﬁlled
the conditions of Article 5(1).22

Regarding the question of lawful use, the CJEU held
that a use is lawful, whether or not the copyright
owner has authorized it, as long as it is consistent with
EU legislation governing the reproduction right.23

The CJEU clariﬁed that

‘independent economic
signiﬁcance’ does not have the same meaning as ‘com-
mercial value’. A work can have commercial value and
yet have no independent economic signiﬁcance:
for
instance, in this case, news snippets have commercial
value, and yet have no independent economic signiﬁ-
cance because no value is added by digitally transmitting
or viewing the news snippets to that already inherent in
them as physical newspaper clippings.24

Finally,

the CJEU dealt with the requirement of
Article 5(5) of the Information Society Directive which
states that the temporary copying exception only applies
in ‘special cases which do not conﬂict with a normal
exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do
not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
rightholder’. The CJEU held that, as it had found that
Article 5(1) was satisﬁed, on the same considerations
Article 5(5) must also be satisﬁed.

Infopaq II
The CJEU further analysed the temporary copying ex-
ception in Infopaq II, a second reference in the same case
as Infopaq I. In this case, the CJEU held that the making
of copies is a ‘necessary’ part of a process if that copy
enables the process to function ‘correctly and efﬁcient-
ly’.25 The CJEU also reiterated what it had said in Infopaq
I concerning internet browsing being a lawful use of a
work,26 and in FAPL that use of a work is not unlawful
by reason only of the fact that it lacks the authorization
of the copyright owner.27

As regards the economic signiﬁcance of a work, the

CJEU conﬁrmed its ﬁndings in FAPL:

the economic advantage derived from their implementation
must not be either distinct or separable from the economic
advantage derived from the lawful use of the work con-
cerned and it must not generate an additional economic ad-
vantage going beyond that derived from that use of the
protected work.28

Application of the temporary copying
exception
Based on these cases, the Supreme Court gave a detailed
opinion on how the temporary copying exception
should, in its view, apply to local copies created by users
when browsing, before referring the question to the
CJEU.

Temporary, transient and incidental
The Supreme Court ran the ﬁrst and second conditions
of Article 5(1) together, saying that ‘temporary’ has the
same meaning as ‘transient’.

Referring to Infopaq I, the Supreme Court explained
that the relevant requirements for a copy to be tempor-
ary or transient are (i) that the storage and deletion of
the copyright material is automatic, as opposed to being
dependent on ‘discretionary human intervention’, and
(ii) that the duration of the copy is limited to what is
‘necessary for the completion of the technological pro-
cesses in question’.

The question therefore arises: are on-screen and hard-
drive copies stored and deleted automatically? The
Supreme Court was of the view that when a user browses
the internet the copies made on his hard-drive are made
automatically, without ‘human intervention’ other than
the decision to browse the internet. Similarly the
Supreme Court explained that the deletion of those
copies is automatic as it is caused by a lapse of time
coupled with continuing use of the browsers, because
hard-drive copies are automatically deleted when a cache
becomes full.

The Supreme Court took a purposive approach: the
object of restricting Article 5(1) to temporary or transi-
ent copies is to ensure that the exception does not apply
to downloads or other more permanent copies which are
‘permanent’ in the sense that they remain until the user
personally chooses to delete them. Although an internet
user could adjust his cache settings and leave his com-
puter switched on in order to preserve a cached copy,
the Supreme Court said that this was irrelevant because
these actions ‘do not involve a discretionary decision
whether to retain the material in memory or not. They
are merely rather artiﬁcial ways of extending the dur-
ation of the relevant “technological processes”’.29 Again,
the Supreme Court was pragmatic, saying that copies
made when browsing must be judged in light of the
normal operation of a computer or its browser, because
the fact that it is possible to devise of a way of extending

the life of the copies does not prevent those copies from
being temporary. The Supreme Court took the same
view when considering whether deletion of hard-drive
and on-screen copies is independent of human interven-
tion, as required by Infopaq I if the copies are to be tem-
porary; merely devising a way to extend the life of a copy
is not sufﬁcient to make deletion dependent on human
intervention, as this would frustrate the purpose of
Article 5(1).

The court continued that as the copies were transient
it is ‘strictly speaking unnecessary to consider whether
they are also “incidental”’;30 however ,it was clear that
they were, as computer software puts a web-page on a
screen and into a cache to enable the user to view that
web-page therefore the creation of the copies is wholly
incidental to the technological process involved.

Lawful use
The Supreme Court considered the question of whether
the exception applies only to copies made in the course
of the transmission of material within a network, as the
NLA argued was the case. Because browsing is not a
‘transmission’ and because recital 33 of the Information
Society Directive is clear that the temporary copying ex-
ception applies to ‘acts which enable browsing as well as
acts of caching to take place’, the Supreme Court said
that it was an ‘impossible contention’ that the exception
should apply only to acts of transmission. Because the
acts of temporary reproduction which ‘enable’ browsing
to occur include the making of temporary copies in the
internet cache of the user’s hard drive and on his screen,
the Supreme Court said that it follows that the recital
‘expressly envisages that the exception will apply to end-
user viewing of web-pages’.31

In any event, the Supreme Court pointed out that the
temporary copying exception does not just cover copies
made in the course of the transmission of material
within a network, but it also extends to copies the sole
purpose of which is to enable a lawful use. The term
‘lawful use’ can be difﬁcult to understand in this context:
it is easy to jump to the conclusion that an unauthorized
use cannot be lawful. However, it is clear that if the tem-
porary copying exception applied only to authorized
copies it would be rendered meaningless as authorized
copies have no need for an exception. The Supreme
Court was able to cut through this confusion, saying
that Article 5(1) is an exception which necessarily oper-
ates to authorize certain copying which would otherwise
be an infringement of the copyright owner’s rights.32

Iona Silverman . Do copies made while browsing infringe?

ARTICLE

721

The question to ask when considering whether a use is
lawful is not whether the rightsholder has authorized the
use, but whether the use is restricted by legislation, as
the Supreme Court clariﬁed by referring to the CJEU’s
decisions in FAPL and Infopaq II. The Supreme Court
was clear that ‘this necessarily includes the use of the
work by an end-user browsing the internet’.33

In the same way that it is lawful to read a book or
a newspaper, it is lawful to browse the internet. The
Supreme Court said that, once it is accepted that part of
the purpose of Article 5(1) is to authorize the making of
copies to enable users to view material on the internet,
the conditions of Article 5(1) should be construed con-
sistently with that purpose.

Integral and essential part of a technological
process
In considering the third condition of Article 5(1)—that
a copy must be an integral and essential part of a techno-
logical process—the Supreme Court said that although
it might be possible to design a computer which does
not make local copies when browsing, computers today
do make such copies when users browse the internet.
Accordingly, on-screen and hard-drive copies are an
integral and essential part of a technological process. It is
difﬁcult to see, even hypothetically, how an on-screen
copy could be avoided any more than a copy made in
the retina of the eye could be avoided when browsing, so
it is reassuring that the Supreme Court has taken this
approach.

Independent economic signiﬁcance
The Supreme Court was also satisﬁed that the ﬁnal con-
dition, namely that the copying should have no inde-
pendent economic signiﬁcance, was satisﬁed because, as
in FAPL, the on-screen and hard-drive copies have no
independent economic value for users when browsing.

Article 5(5)
Article 5(5) of the Information Society Directive speci-
ﬁes that the temporary copying exception applies only in
cases which do not conﬂict with a normal exploitation
of the work or other subject-matter and which do not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
rightsholder. Although it did not make a ruling on
whether copies made when browsing fall under the ex-
ception at Article 5(1), the Supreme Court was un-
equivocal that

Once it is accepted that article 5.1 extends in principle to
temporary copies made for the purpose of browsing by an
unlicensed end-user, much of the argument which the
courts below accepted unravels.34

The Supreme Court added:

Once these matters are established, it follows that article 5.5
is also satisﬁed.35

The Supreme Court made no ruling on whether Article
5(1) applies to copies made when browsing as it felt that
this was too important an issue not to be resolved uni-
formly across Europe. However, Lord Sumption was
explicit in his unanimously accepted judgment that,
in his view, based on recent CJEU case law (of which
the High Court and Court of Appeal had not had the
beneﬁt), the copies made when browsing fulﬁl the condi-
tions of Article 5(1). In particular, Lord Sumption was
not persuaded by the argument that, if viewing content
online does not require a licence, rightsholders would be
exposed to large-scale piracy, and he said that the CJEU
did not appear to have been persuaded of this either. He
said that diminution in the rights of copyright owners
must necessarily narrow the scope of their protection
but that this should be kept in proportion. Rightsholders
still have a right of action against pirates, against people
who upload infringing content; indeed, the Information
Society Directive contains important provisions enlar-
ging the range of procedures and sanctions available
against piracy.

Lord Sumption then considered the practical conse-
quences which would ensue, should a decision to the
contrary be made.

Consequences
In considering the implications of the application of the
temporary copying exception to on-screen and hard-
drive copies, the Supreme Court referred to the EU’s
policy of maintaining a high level of protection of intel-
lectual property but said that it was necessary to keep
this concept in proportion. First, one should remember
that Article 5(1) is an exception to the right to copy
which, by its very nature as an exception, must operate
to authorize copying which would otherwise be infrin-
ging. Secondly, the Supreme Court reminds us that it
has never been an infringement merely to read an article.
Article 5(1) simply seeks to equate the law, as it applies
to the physical world, to the online world making it legal
the
to read an article using a computer. Thirdly,

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2013, Vol. 8, No. 9

Supreme Court said that if it is an infringement to view
copyright protected material online, then all those who
browse the internet will likely commit infringements,
which ‘seems an unacceptable result, which would make
infringers of many millions of ordinary users of the
internet across the EU who use browsers and search
engines for private as well as commercial purposes’.36

The Supreme Court next considered Meltwater’s pos-
ition: although Article 5(1) could permit users to view
copyright material,
it did not permit Meltwater to
upload or make copies of that material. Thus Meltwater
still required a licence from the NLA or the publishers,
which it has.

The quest for uniformity
The Supreme Court therefore referred the question of
whether Article 5(1) of the Information Society Direct-
ive applies to local copies made when browsing the inter-
net to the CJEU, in order that the issue be resolved
uniformly across Europe. While the speciﬁc questions
are yet to be drafted, in the meantime it is clear that the
Supreme Court has provided the CJEU with a very
detailed opinion on the matter.

The Supreme Court was clear that the aim of Article
5(1) was not to enable pirates to circumvent the law, and
that rightsholders would still have a course of action
against those who upload material without authoriza-
tion. Article 5(1) does not negate any course of action
against pirates, it simply forces rightsholders to seek
those who are ‘more obviously at fault’.37

Although, in the Supreme Court’s view, users should
not be required to enter into licences with rightsholders
in order to view content, Meltwater must be authorized
to use that content. Lord Sumption commented that it is
likely that the licence fee chargeable to Meltwater will be
substantially higher if the CJEU agrees that users do not
need a licence. The NLA has lodged an alternative claim
with the Copyright Tribunal who may need to review the
licencing scheme between the NLA and news aggregators
on that basis.

The CJEU’s decision will not be available for 12 to 18
months but will be eagerly awaited by users and right-
sholders alike seeking clarity as to what constitutes a
temporary copy. The Supreme Court’s decision is re-
freshingly pragmatic and demonstrates that the UK
courts are able to balance the effects of our ever evolving
technology with the demands of the law.
