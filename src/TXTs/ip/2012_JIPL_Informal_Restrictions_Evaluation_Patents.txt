Informal restrictions and evaluation of patents
Oliver P. Baldus and Christian Heckmann*

Traditional IP management ideas
The development of what is now commonly known as
patent management began in the USA in the late
1980s, after the newly founded Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit1 handed down numerous verdicts
in favour of patent owners.2 The existence of this new
court signiﬁcantly increased the enforceability of IP
rights, thereby drawing public attention to their proﬁt-
ability.3

In short order, large companies such as IBM4 and
Instruments5 began developing sophisticated
Texas
licensing programs to increase patent-based revenue. In
this context, ﬁrms also had to develop methods of
patent valuation so as to guarantee sound investment
decisions.

Europe has lagged behind signiﬁcantly in regard to
recognizing the importance of active patent manage-
ment strategies, and patent-valuation methods as a part
thereof.6 Only over the course of the past ten years or
so has signiﬁcant progress been made in these areas.7

This ever-growing interest in patent management and
valuation is also in part a function of the recent emer-
gence of numerous business models that utilize IP rights
as their central asset.8 Some examples of this are:9
† IP mutual funds
† IP auctions
† IP trolls
† IP consulting

IP analysis services

IP data mining

IP insurance

IP ﬁnance

As these examples indicate, there is signiﬁcant diversiﬁ-
cation taking place in the way patents are used. No
longer are they solely a means of protecting one’s
invention.10

Founded in 1982, this is the main court in charge of appeals regarding
patent infringement suits.
For example, in 1986, the court ruled that Kodak was to pay $925 million
dollars in damages to the ten times smaller company Polaroid for
infringement of its patents.

† Most patents suffer from a reduced actual en-
forceability, eg due to a threat from counter
patents by a competitor. This fact results in the
set of formal rights (prohibitive rights) granted
by patents often being reduced to a smaller set
of rights which are actually enforceable, termed
the informal
restrictions approach (‘IR ap-
proach’). The reduced set of rights is considered
when determining the value of a patent, leading
to more precise results.

interface for modelling competitive patent situa-
tions in a simple way, thereby facilitating the

let us brieﬂy specify under what conditions
patents create value for a ﬁrm so that we may better
understand what exactly might constitute effective
patent management.

ARTICLE

Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, 2012, Vol. 7, No. 8

In short, the economic worth of a patent is the
utility it brings to a ﬁrm in comparison to a situation
without the patent.11 More precisely, it can be deﬁned
as the worth of the ﬁrm holding the patent in compari-
son to the worth of the ﬁrm without the patent.

However, there are certain misconceptions regarding
patents and their
supposed inherent value. Many
people erroneously believe that mere ownership of a
patent automatically leads to great wealth. This is
simply not
the case. Owning a patent guarantees
neither wealth nor any proﬁt at all, for that matter.
Rather, within patents, there may exist a potential for
proﬁt, derived from the competitive advantage granted
by the patent’s prohibitive nature, that is, the owner’s
ability to prohibit others from making, using or selling
his invention. However, being able to impede others
alone will not lead to any kind of revenue. In order to
proﬁt from a patent, its owner must also have and exer-
cise the ability to make use of the advantage contained
within it.12 This ability to utilize a patent’s advantage is
usually contingent on complementary factors, such as
having the necessary capital or production facilities to
commercialize the invention or being familiar enough
with the industry to know where the invention might
be made proﬁtable in the ﬁrst place. Indeed, in some
instances an inventor may hold a patent to a technology
that is simply not useful in his speciﬁc industry. Apart
from having no use for the technology, he may further
lack the necessary funds, know-how or production
facilities to commercialize the invention. To be sure, an
invention, eg, in the form of an innovative technology
or production method, does not equal a marketable
product. Thus one of the reasons many inventions are
licensed out to third parties is that sometimes there
may be no other feasible way to proﬁt from them.

The value-in-context phenomenon
It becomes clear that the degree to which a patent can
be made proﬁtable is contingent in large part on the
speciﬁc context in which it is placed. A patent’s value
can ﬂuctuate drastically depending on the context in
which it is used, as we shall also see later.13 This is

Hundertmark,

Magazine 12/01, 33.

commonly referred to as the ‘value-in-context’ phe-
nomenon.14

Beyond the need for certain complementary goods,
the generally high speciﬁcity of inventions and their
corresponding patents also contribute to this phenom-
enon. Inventions with a broad range of general uses,
such as the light bulb, have become exceptionally rare.
Presently, most patentable technologies are speciﬁc in
nature and have only a small niche-area of application,
thus exhibiting a low transfer value. This means that
there are few, if any, other ﬁrms that could make use of
the technology and, consequently, there is neither a
competitor against which the patent would grant a
competitive advantage, nor are there potential custo-
mers to license. In this scenario, the invention itself
may have a high value for the ﬁrm; the value of the cor-
responding patent, however, will be close to zero.15 16

To summarize, Figure 1 shows a patent’s value as a
its potential value, the existence of the
function of
complementary assets necessary to tap into this poten-
tial, as well as the exploitation process, that is, the spe-
ciﬁc way in which one goes about tapping into the
patent’s potential, eg, marketing techniques.17

Returning to our examination of patent manage-
ment, it becomes clear that if one’s patents (or patent
portfolios18) are to create any signiﬁcant amount of
revenue—be it in the form of innovative products or
revenue from licences—active management and stra-
tegic decision-making is mandatory.

a patent. The amount is regularly in the tens of thousands of euros.

17 Above n 6, 30: the varying sizes of the pieces show that the three parts do

not necessarily contribute equally to the patent’s value, while the jagged
edges symbolize the need for a holistic strategy that tailors each
component to the other two.

18 It is rare for ﬁrms to hold single patents. For our purposes, ‘patent

portfolio’ means a group of patents belonging to a ﬁrm.

Oliver P. Baldus and Christian Heckmann . Informal restrictions and evaluation of patents

ARTICLE

In this sense, IP rights have become yet another stra-
tegic marketing tool, used in ways that go far beyond
the protection of one’s intellectual property.19

Effective patent management means maximizing the
highly context-dependent value of one’s IP rights by
strategically coordinating all components relevant to a
given situation.20 This requires intricate knowledge of
business administration, economics, strategic marketing
and law.

Unfortunately, this need for interdisciplinary expert-
ise frequently leads to confusion and, subsequently,
mismanagement. This is especially true for mid-sized
ﬁrms, which often cannot afford professional manage-
ment services. In some instances, ﬁrms even choose not
to actively manage their patents at all due to lack of
know-how.

A new way of thinking about patents?
We will now look at the so-called Informal Restrictions
Approach (‘IR approach’) and what it can do to facili-
tate a more accurate understanding of patent situa-
tions. Speciﬁcally, its purpose is to present an intuitive
approach to understanding the
characteristics of
patents in competitive situations. In this sense, it can
be considered a context in which considerations of
patent strategy or valuation should be based.

The informal restrictions approach
The basic contention of the IR approach is that the
formal rights granted by a patent are in many cases not
fully exercisable due to informal restrictions arising
from the particular environment of the patent-owning
ﬁrm. It values patents based on the de facto opportun-
ities they present to their owner.

Formal rights afforded by a patent are based on
negative rights, which allow the patent owner
to
prevent others from using the invention without his
consent. The extent of these formal rights depends on
the legal scope of the subject matter protected by the
patent, the number of countries for which protection is
granted and the lifetime of the patent.

While,

legally speaking, all patents afford their
owners the same level of protection in regard to their
right to prohibit third-party use of an invention, they
may differ greatly in regard to the actual enforceability
of these rights.21 Such a reduction in a patent’s enforce-

Figure 2. Patent with limited enforceability.

ability can have various causes. A patent may,
for
example, be limited in its enforceability due to consid-
erations of reputation. Most often, however, it is due to
competitors—or clients (in a supply chain environ-
ment)—owning what can be referred to as ‘counter-
patents’. These are patents that are relevant to a ﬁrm’s
business but which are owned by a competitor.

Counter-patents afford their owners the opportunity
to ‘retaliate’, should they be the targets of legal hostil-
ities, eg, temporary injunctions, infringement suits or
nullity procedures. Figure 2 shows one such patent
with a reduced scope. While the legal system grants a
particular set of
formal rights to the owner of the
patent—as indicated by the dashed line—not all of
these rights are actually enforceable. In practice, only a
reduced subset of enforceable rights remains, as indi-
cated by the solid line.

For example, if ﬁrm A wants to make use of a new
patent and prohibit ﬁrm B from using its technology,
and ﬁrm B owns a patent to a technology that is cur-
rently in use by A, there exists an interdependency
between the ﬁrms, which would manifest itself in a
legal stand-off should a conﬂict occur. Enforcing a par-
ticular IP right in these situations will likely lead to
retaliation by the competitor, resulting in legal conﬂicts
that waste company resources. Because these legal cases
often cannot be won by either party, coexistence and
collaboration usually occur.

Figure 3 depicts two situations. In case 1, Firm A
enjoys full exercisability, since the de-facto-scope of its
patent 1 coincides with its formal scope. This is the
case because the scope of patent 1 reaches into Firm B’s
business operations, and Firm B owns no counter-

production facilities and necessary capital to commer-
cialize the invention; (iii) it has a whole department
dedicated to coordinating business strategy with IP
management services in charge of
the exploitation
process.

According to the ‘value-in-context’ theory, all three
conditions needed to realize a patents potential value
are fulﬁlled. As a consequence, a given valuation
method would come to the conclusion that the patent
in question is of high monetary value. This, however, is
not necessarily the case.

We established earlier that a patent’s value is not in-
herent, but rather depends upon the owner’s ability to
make use of the potential contained within it. This
being so, a patent’s value becomes a function of the
degree to which the rights granted by it are actually en-
forceable.

To make this clearer, let us add a further premise to
our scenario: (iv) both competitors currently hold
patents on technology used by our imaginary company.
As is sometimes the case between large companies op-
erating in the same industry, no licensing agreements
were concluded.22 These patents owned by FBM’s com-
petitors could be used to impede FBM’s production sig-
niﬁcantly and have thus far not been utilized only
because it was more proﬁtable for both companies to
co-exist, peacefully that is, each allowing the other to
use its own technology without agreement or via cross-
licensing agreements. As to (iv), FBM could not make
use of its patent without fear of retaliation by its com-
petitors. This informal restriction effectively reduces the
de facto scope of the patent. Even though, legally speak-
ing, FBM could make use of its prohibitive rights, the
economic backlash could be so severe that it would not
be commercially viable to do so.

Thus a patent’s value is not a function of three, but

rather of four components:

(1) Potential value;

(2) Complementary goods;

(3) Exploitation process; and

(4) The de facto ability to utilize the patent, contingent
upon the existence of counter- patents or other infor-
mal restrictions.

The severity of retaliatory measures depends on the
quality of the counter-patents, that is, the degree of
relevance they have to one’s business operations. If, for

patents with which to retaliate (Patent 2 lacks the ne-
cessary legal scope to affect Firm A). In case 2 the situ-
ation is different: Firm B also owns a patent that affects
Firm A’s business, leading to mutual interdependence,
as outlined above. In this case the de facto scope of
both patents is reduced, as indicated by the dotted line.
Thus, despite being identical formal rights, not all
patents are created equally. This has signiﬁcant implica-
tions for the commercial valuation of patents: Any
valuation method must necessarily take these informal
restrictions into account if the monetary value of the
patent is to reﬂect the actual value it will have for the
ﬁrm. This is especially relevant when buying or selling
patents since transferring an IP right from one owner,
ie, one context, to the next, can fundamentally change
its value. As mentioned earlier, what may be of ex-
tremely high value to one ﬁrm may be near useless to
another.

The IR approach can be considered a qualiﬁcation
of the ‘value-in-context’ phenomenon. While the latter
stresses that a patent’s value is context-dependent, it
fails to address the fact that what ultimately matters
most
is the owner’s ability to actualize this value.
‘Ability’ in this context is not know-how, but rather the
freedom from external constraints in the form of infor-
mal restrictions.

To elaborate, let us imagine a scenario in which a
ﬁrm, FBM, has been granted a new patent. Let us
further assume the following premises: (i) the potential
value of the patent is great, eg, because it grants FBM
the ability to prohibit its only two competitors from
using an up-and-coming technology that is vital to
progress in the industry; (ii) the ﬁrm is well established
the complementary goods in form of
and has all

22 The same applies to situations in which existing licence agreements are

up for renewal within the next few weeks or months.

Deﬁning a ﬁrm’s IP potential
In terms of the IP potential, patents and other IP rights
are to be regarded as prohibitive formal rights that
could actually be used as tools against competitors.
However, in practice it is often neglected that not the
number of patents as such but only patents that actual-
ly affect a competitor can be seen as this type of tool
contributing to the aforementioned IP potential.28

When determining the ﬁrm’s IP potential, the ﬁrst
step is to measure the ﬁrm’s overall potential for using
these tools against a given competitor. In practice,
most ﬁrms hold a large number of patents, each of
which has a different impact on any one competitor. In
order to determine the ﬁrm’s overall IP potential it is
thus necessary to review each individual patent in the
context of its relevance for the particular competitor’s
business operations.

Far from being simple, however, a given patent’s
impact has to be determined under consideration of
various factors, eg, the scope of the patent, its duration,
workaround solutions of the protected subject matter
and enforceability.29 Beyond these, many other, some-
times more subtle, internal and external factors may in-
ﬂuence the viability and effectiveness of a patent’s
ability to affect a competitor, such as the position of
the owner within the supply chain.30

Accordingly, the determination of a ﬁrm’s IP poten-
tial involves weighing and summing up all individual
impacts. That overall IP potential for hitting a particu-
lar competitor in production may range from a very
low degree (weak IP potential), where a competitor’s
business is hardly affected by one’s possible actions, to
a high degree, in which a competitor could actually be
forced out of business by way of a number of effectively
used patents that inhibit his production capabilities
(strong IP potential).

The second step in deriving a ﬁrm’s IP position
within the IP strategy matrix is determining the com-
petitor’s IP potential for impairing one’s own business
activities in the same way, as seen from the opposite
side. Having established both one’s own and the com-
petitor’s IP potential, a relative IP strength (RIS) can be

which a monetary value can be attributed only secondarily. For
established portfolio analyses see A Poredda and S Wildschu¨tz ‘Patent
Valuation—A controlled Market Share Approach’ (2004) Les Nouvelles
No.2, 77 –85; A Wurzer and S Hundertmark ‘Value oriented IP
Management’ (2006) IAM Magazine 12/01, 33.

instance, there exist simple workaround solutions, the
counter-patents can be considered harmless.

The decision of whether to make use of a given
patent thus depends on a cost – beneﬁt analysis: if the
gains from employing a patent are larger than the costs
associated with the retaliatory measures, it is feasible to
employ the patent. The IP strategy matrix introduced
below facilitates this process of analyzing a ﬁrm’s situ-
ation in this regard.

The IP strategy matrix—a way to depict
strategic situations
The IP strategy matrix (IPS matrix) introduced here
(Figure 4) uses a graphical representation in order to
visualize a ﬁrm’s IP position with respect to a single
competitor. In this sense, it is a form of bivariate port-
folio analysis.23 It seeks to identify viable courses of
action in the form of generic IP strategies and deter-
mine optimal resource allocation of IP rights.24 25

A company’s IP position is derived from two vari-
ables: (i) its exposure,26 deﬁned as a function of the
ﬁrm’s revenue and the competing ﬁrm’s ability to affect
this revenue by utilizing IP rights and (ii) the ﬁrm’s IP
potential, that is, its potential to hit the competitor in
his business by utilizing its own IP rights, under con-
sideration of any existing informal restrictions.27

24 A rather unstructured approach regarding patent strategies was published

by RL Cantrell Outpacing the Competition (John Wiley & Sons 2009).

Weber, G Hedemann, H Cohausz Patentstrategien (Heymanns 2006).

restrictions.

introduced here primarily focuses on identifying generic IP strategies to

deﬁned as the quotient between the IP potential of the
ﬁrm over that of its competitor and serves as a useful
identiﬁer for a ﬁrm’s IP position. The ﬁrm’s IP position
can then be graphically represented on the horizontal
and vertical axes of the IPS matrix, as seen in Figure 8.
Based on these evaluations, it assigns to the ﬁrm one of
four distinct
IP positions, denoted here as walls,
weapons, weaknesses and wastelands.

This differentiation into four positions takes into
consideration the IR approach, which is imperative to
gaining an accurate understanding of a ﬁrm’s IP situ-
ation.

Importantly, the IPS matrix functions primarily as
an interface for visualizing competitive situations based
on IP rights. While complex calculations could certain-
ly be integrated into the model, its main strength lies
in its simplicity. Thus what is presented here are not
the particularities of calculating these situations, but
rather the general workings of the model itself, as well
as the generic strategies corresponding to the four IP
positions.

The ‘walls’ position
The walls position, as shown in the upper right corner
of the IPS matrix, arises when two competing ﬁrms
have equally strong IP potential and the RIS-value is
approximately one. This symmetrical situation is quite
common and typically given between equal players, ie,
ﬁrms of equal size. A ﬁrm’s size, however, need not ne-
cessarily dictate its IP potential. Indeed, it is possible—
and not entirely uncommon—for ﬁrms of signiﬁcantly
differing sizes to ﬁnd themselves in a walls position. In
effect, a walls position means that each company is,
theoretically, equally capable of hindering the business
activities of the other (see informal restrictions ap-
proach in Figure 3). As a consequence, an implicit
stand-off
situation between the competitors arises,
which can best be modelled with the game theoretic
model of a so-called iterated prisoner’s dilemma.31 As
mentioned, signiﬁcant
informal restrictions tend to

form of requital.

legal battles. Taking this

One optimal strategy in such a prisoner’s dilemma
situation, as shown by the payoff matrix in Figure 5,

Figure 5. depicting a matrix of the payoffs of a prisoner’s
dilemma.

involves seeking agreement and cooperation with a
friendly competitor, which leads to a gain of 80 for
each company. In the case of an initiated attack, which
could temporarily lead to a gain of 100 for the attack-
ing ﬁrm, retaliation would occur in the next round of
the game, resulting in a much smaller payoff of 20 for
both in all subsequent games.

Therefore, collaboration is optimal only as long as
there exists behavioural reciprocity between the two
ﬁrms. If a competitor attacks one’s ﬁrm, it is necessary
to retaliate in order not only to increase one’s gains but
also to maintain credibility.32 This simple ‘tit-for-tat’
strategy has been extensively researched, and evidence
suggests that it provides optimum gains for each party
in cases of on-going, ie, iterated games.33

For a paradigm of a similar stand-off situation and
tit-for-tat strategies, one can compare this IP situation
with the arms race during the Cold War, in which the
USA and USSR were caught in a clinch for power that
forced each to commit
tremendous amounts of
resources to matching the other’s investments in order
to avoid becoming militarily inferior and risking anni-
hilation. Correspondingly, the role of patents in a walls
position is to maintain an option for retaliation and
constitute defence mechanisms against hostile IP-based
and other attacks, such as aggressive marketing. In this
sense, one’s own IP rights can be more illustratively
interpreted as defence walls surrounding one’s business
assets.34

In real life, walls may be erected in order to protect
assets from, say, an aggressive neighbour. They can be
lowered gradually when trust and friendship emerge,

strates
strategies
employed in a walls situation. As above, a ﬁrm’s behav-
iour in a walls position is largely dependent on the be-
haviour of its ‘neighbour’, that is, its competitor. This
means that when a competitor increases investments in
IP rights that are relevant for one’s own ﬁrm—and,
subsequently,
threat of an IP-related lawsuit
increases—it is necessary to respond accordingly, ie, by
enhancing one’s own IP position. Likewise, when the
competing ﬁrm maintains IP investments, one’s own
position may be kept as well.

the

The decision-making process with regard to IP invest-
ments follows this train of thought in that it calls for a
thorough analysis of one’s relationship to and with the
competitor. Having considered the nature of one’s rela-
tionships, one may determine whether, and to what
degree, protective measures in the form of IP rights/
patents, are needed in order to avoid being caught off-
guard by a potential attack. While a minimum line of
defence is usually necessary to protect the core of one’s
business regardless of how good the relationship to rele-
vant competitor’s may be, there are also situations in
which no barriers are needed since there is no risk of an
attack, eg, between afﬁliated parts of a corporate group.

Bearing this in mind,

the walls position generally
allows for two types of strategies, namely the collaboration
strategy and the decapitation attack strategy. As the names
suggest, one is defensive in nature, aiming at peaceful co-
existence and the maximization of collective gains; the
other is offensive in nature, seeking to incapacitate a
competitor and maximize individual gains. Presuming
that the potential of the ﬁrm and its competitor are
equally strong, a strategy decision should be based on
factors such as the ﬁrm’s size, available resources and his-
toric relationship with the competitor. Further considera-
tions will, among other
take into account
marketing-related questions such as to what degree the
competitor is actually encroaching on one’s own business.
If, for example, both ﬁrms target the same market, there
may be a more immediate need to take offensive action
than if the market overlap is fairly small. Ultimately, the
costs of an aggressive action must be weighed against the
prospect of successfully eliminating a competitor and the
gains this would entail. In doing so, ﬁrms should analyse
the associated costs holistically, taking into account, for
example, the costs of a potential loss of reputation.

things,

While the strategies are at opposite ends of the
spectrum of possible actions, all intermediaries are sub-
optimal. Keeping this in mind, ﬁrms should thus
thoroughly evaluate the unique nature of their speciﬁc
situation and then fully commit to their strategy of
choice, both of which shall now be examined more
closely.35

Collaboration strategy
Generally speaking, there is no reason to disregard in-
formal restrictions and initiate any type of hostile
action, eg, attacks such as infringement suits or oppos-
ition and nullity procedures against a friendly competi-
tor, ie, one that does not attack one’s own company.
Such hostile action is sub-optimal in the context of a
tit-for-tat strategy because it wastes company resources
while achieving few gains,
if any: a competitor will
simply retaliate by employing his own IP rights,
causing a stand-off leading to high legal- and oppor-
tunity-costs for both companies.36 It follows that half-
hearted attacks and casual
should be
avoided completely in these situations since they lack
the dedicated effort necessary for achieving any signiﬁ-
cant impact. Unfortunately, many ﬁrms still engage in
this
ambiguous behaviour
without adhering to a general IP strategy, eg, by ﬁling
scattered opposition proceedings.

type of uncommitted,

skirmishes

Thus, if a company ﬁnds itself in a walls position
and wants to avoid such a futile, resource-intense con-
ﬂict, it should choose the collaboration strategy, which
entails an approach based not only on tolerance of, and
respect for, the competitor’s business, but also on co-
operative measures aimed at making both companies
better off, such as cross-licensing agreements. Seeking
full cooperation and agreement with a competitor on
IP-related questions will result in optimum gains for
both parties and, it is hoped, peaceful coexistence over
an extended period.37

With regard to distinguishing a friendly competitor
from a hostile one, it is often difﬁcult to recognize
hostile behaviour in advance. In particular, changes in
patenting behaviour are usually undetectable without a
certain delay due to the 18-month period before patent
applications are published. A competitor’s attitude can
change quite rapidly during times of transformations,
eg when a key patent expires, economic problems arise
or a new manager comes in. Because of this, ﬁrms
should monitor a competitor’s actions closely and

cooperation.

this time should be used to prepare the second vital
component of the strategy.

Equally, a sudden and complete change of behaviour
also offers the most promising approach for attacking
the competitor, as will now be shown.

Decapitation-attack strategy
The offensive course of action in a walls position,
termed the ‘decapitation-attack’ strategy, is based on
the idea of attacking the competitor in such a way that
he completely loses his ability to retaliate. This strategy
seeks to obliterate the informal restrictions posed by
the threat of an adverse counter-attack. It can be con-
sidered both riskier and more resource-intensive than
the collaboration strategy. However, it is also the strat-
egy that provides much greater gains if successfully
implemented. It is this prospect of exceedingly large
future gains for the ‘surviving’ ﬁrm that is responsible
for the attractiveness of this approach.

The basic premise of the strategy is to ‘attack’ the
competitor, using various IP rights-related measures
in order to incapacitate the competitor’s economic
resources. This can be accomplished in a two-pronged
fashion, that is, by improving one’s own and impair-
ing the competitor’s IP potential,
for example by
ﬁling a large number of suits and procedures against
the competitor, thereby effectively overwhelming him.
This is done in the shortest amount of time possible
in order to take full advantage of the element of sur-
prise, and can be accompanied by additional measures
that assist
the competitor’s retaliation
potential.

the loss of

Since it is necessary rapidly to increase the RIS
value, the ﬁrst element of implementing a decapita-
tion-attack strategy is to improve one’s own IP poten-
tial discreetly. This is achieved, for example, by ﬁling
new patent applications or by buying existing IP rights.
With regard to new patent applications, ﬁrms
should attempt to ﬁle these in short order so that their
publication is focused around the same time, which is
generally around 18 months after the ﬁling date. To
accomplish this,
it may make sense to delay the
applications for previous inventions to a date when
applications for more recent inventions are simultan-
eously possible. Since the competitor is not able to an-
ticipate an attack within the 18-month period between
the ﬁling and publication of new patent applications,

recognizes

As mentioned previously, the second element of a
decapitation-attack involves impairing the competitor’s
IP potential. Common ways of achieving this are by
ﬁling nullity and infringement suits or triggering op-
position procedure. Since the competitor almost imme-
diately
is
important that they be coordinated in such a way that
they coincide with the ﬁrst component of the attack as
outlined above. If the attack is discovered before publi-
cation of one’s ﬁled applications, the second element
must be initiated immediately in order to maximize
the chance of success.

activities, however,

these

it

Ideally, an attack is triggered by the simultaneous
publication of one’s new patent applications and the
ﬁling of a large number of supplemental measures
aimed at tying up the competitor’s resources such as
nullity procedures, infringement suits and temporary
injunctions. On this note, the attack could even be
further supplemented by including non-IP-related mea-
sures, such as aggressive marketing campaigns, thus
creating a truly holistic attack.38

Since the decapitation-attack strategy is only success-
ful if the targeted competitor is caught off-guard, it is
of utmost importance to delay the competitor’s aware-
ness of one’s undertakings for as long as possible.
Along with thorough preparation and effective timing,
the element of surprise is a key factor in the successful
implementation of this strategy.

Due to the surprising appearance and overwhelm-
ing nature of the decapitation attack, it is very difﬁ-
cult to defend against it: the competitor must hastily
raise a defence against an unexpected and well-pre-
pared multi-dimensional attack.39 Often the business
simply does not have enough resources—human,
monetary or logistical—to defend against a larger
number of well-prepared actions. While this is a
major advantage for an attacking ﬁrm, however, this
fact also makes it necessary to monitor the competi-
tor’s behaviour constantly in order to pre-empt the
risk of falling prey to such constantly actions oneself.
It may even make sense to keep some short-term
human resources on standby if a relationship to a par-
ticular competitor seems especially volatile.

In summary,

the collaboration strategy is best
in most competitive situations.
It allows ﬁrms to
beneﬁt from mutual cooperation measures, such as

cross-licensing agreements and sharing of resources,
while avoiding the high costs associated with legal
battles. Nevertheless, ﬁrms should regularly (re)evaluate
their IP potential—especially during times of transi-
tion—both in order to detect potential decapitation
attacks as well as recognize situations in which it may
be advantageous to launch an attack themselves. In
particular, a strong and sudden increase of ﬁling activ-
ities, leading to an imbalance in IP rights, could be an
indication of an imminent attack.

Though a collaboration strategy in a walls position
can be quite comfortable for ﬁrms and may generate
many gains, it is nevertheless an unstable equilibrium
and ﬁrms must remain prudent at all times, as men-
tioned above. For this reason, ﬁrms may prefer to seek
out the relative safety of a weapons position in the long
term.

The ‘weapons’ position
The weapons position, depicted in the lower right
corner of the IPS matrix, describes an asymmetrical
state that is characterized by a strong imbalance in IP
potential and leads to a high RIS value that signiﬁcant-
ly exceeds one. One ﬁrm is much ‘stronger’, and can
thus easily exert its strong IP potential on a competitor
without fear of retaliation.

In this case, the spectrum of possible strategies is
much wider than in a walls position, allowing also for
intermediate or extended strategies between collabor-
ation and decapitation attack, such as attrition and
overt attacks. This position corresponds to a state in
which a mighty ﬁrm faces a defenceless competitor
against which IP rights can be used as ‘weapons’ rela-
tively indiscriminately and without fear of retaliation.40
Speaking from the viewpoint of the IR approach, the
low opposite potential for retaliation lowers the infor-
mal restrictions associated with own IP rights, as can
be seen in Figure 6. Consequently, the set of actually
enforceable rights (solid line) is increased within the
set of formal rights (dotted line) as compared with the
walls position as depicted in Figure 2.

itself

However,

just because a ﬁrm ﬁnds

in a
weapons position does not mean that it should neces-
sarily exploit it. Indeed, there could be situations in
which it would be more comfortable for the strong
ﬁrm to reside in the relative comfort of arranged col-
laboration, similar to that of a walls position.

Nevertheless, though much more comfortable than a
classic walls position, ﬁrms in a weapons position

Figure 6. Patent enforceability in a weapons situation.

should still monitor the activities of their competitors,
lest they lose their advantage and are thrown back into
a walls position. This is especially true for situations in
which the IP based advantage rests on a single key
patent.

In order to keep weak competitors from improving
their IP potential, a strong ﬁrm may use an attrition
strategy, in which it intermittently ﬁles suits or proce-
dures against the competitor in order to drain his
resources. Which strategy should be chosen depends
largely on the broader context of the situation. There
may be cases in which it would be unwise to attack or
hinder the competitor, eg, for reasons of reputation. In
any case, whether a company chooses to fully exploit a
weapons position or not, it should seek to maintain its
strength by continuously monitoring its IP potential
vis-a`-vis its main or potential competitors and invest-
ing in its IP potential if need be.

In practice, the weapons position is often occupied
by non-producing ﬁrms, such as patent trolls, since
their non-existing production cannot be hit by the
patents of another ﬁrm. To these trolls,
informal
restrictions do not exist and, accordingly,
they are
assigned the highest RIS values.

An example of a weapons position being exploited is
the current struggle between the ﬁrms Oracle and
Google, in which Oracle seeks to charge Google high
licence fees. Google has so far been incapable of
defending against this due to its weak IP potential in
relation to Oracle.41

‘Weaknesses’ and ‘wastelands’
The weaknesses position, shown in the upper left hand
corner of the IPS matrix, is the inverse of the weapons
position, characterized by a weak and a mighty com-

attempt by utilizing his own IP rights. Thus moving
from a weaknesses
to a walls position essentially
involves employing the ﬁrst half of a decapitation-
attack strategy to establish a balance in the IP poten-
tials and reaching a RIS value close to one.

The wastelands position is shown in the lower left
section of the IP strategy matrix (Figure 4). In most
patent systems, these wastelands arise in settings where
patents are not possible or competitors do not hold
any patents even though they theoretically could.42
Since in a wastelands situation the corresponding IP
potential is extremely weak, the RIS value cannot be
deﬁned reasonably and informal restrictions do not
exist. Consequently, these situations are rather uninter-
esting in terms of IP strategies.

In reality, wastelands are found in business areas
where patents are not provided or business is based on
long standing technologies with expired patents.
Common examples of wastelands are the business seg-
ments of retailers or the clothing industry, which nor-
mally do not hold any patents. Nonetheless, if a ﬁrm
obtains a patent strongly affecting a competitor it
could immediately reach the weapons position.

Summary
The IR approach presents itself as an intuitive and easy
to apply paradigm for thinking about patents in com-
petitive situations. It is based on the idea that the set of
actually enforceable rights is always a subset of the
legally granted formal rights. The size of this subset
depends on the particular context in which the patent
is embedded, eg, the patent owner’s position in the
value chain. Thus changing the context of the patent
directly affects its value.

The IR approach proves itself useful by starting with
the de facto capabilities a patent affords its owner.
Building on this new approach, the IP strategy matrix
serves as a useful interface for modelling competitive
patent situations in a simple way, thereby facilitating
the derivation of viable patent strategies. As with the
IR approach, it too can be seen as a context in which
other, more technical considerations of valuation may
take place.

petitor, resulting in a low RIS value tending towards
zero. The weaknesses position is dangerous since it
leaves the company at the mercy of a mighty competi-
tor, unable to enforce its own IP rights or even merely
use them as ‘walls’, ie, deterrence mechanisms. Because
a ﬁrm in a weaknesses position is so vulnerable to
hostile attacks, aggressive behaviour
toward strong
competitors must be avoided at all costs so as not to
provoke any retaliatory measures.

In terms of the IR approach, informal restrictions
are extremely high—with an RIS value tending towards
the weak company cannot afford to
zero—since
enforce even one of
its patents regardless of how
powerful they might have been. Often start-up com-
panies will ﬁnd themselves in a weaknesses position.
Consequently the set of actually enforceable rights
shrinks to an empty set.

Though not as powerful initially, patents are still of
high importance for ﬁrms in weaknesses positions:
They are vital building blocks for achieving the safety
of patent parity vis-a`-vis a competitor, ie, a walls pos-
ition.

To achieve this, a company must improve its IP po-
tential despite its weak initial position, eg, by research
and development
investment or by buying existing
patents. It is imperative that any measures of this sort
be undertaken with the greatest amount of care and
secrecy as possible. Should the competitor discover any
efforts geared at reaching a walls position and feel
threatened by them, he could easily snuff out any such

made by man’, in Europe patents for non-technical subject matters are
not admissible.
