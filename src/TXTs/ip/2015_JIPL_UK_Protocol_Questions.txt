UK claim construction: return of the Protocol
questions and file wrapper estoppel
Ralph Cox and Simon Spink*

Assumptions, Actavis and Arnold J
For the 10 years since the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in
Kirin-Amgen v Hoescht Marion Roussel,1 it has been
widely assumed that there is no ﬁle wrapper estoppel in
the UK and no doctrine of equivalents either. Both these
assumptions are thrown into doubt by the Patent Court’s
decision in Actavis v Eli Lilly.2 The judge, Mr Justice
Arnold, ﬁrst applied the more or less defunct Improver or
Protocol Questions3 in a manner that potentially opens
the door to a doctrine of equivalents in all but name. The
judge then held that the court should not shut its eyes to
the prosecution ﬁle but should ensure a patentee did not
abuse the system by accepting narrow claims during
prosecution and then arguing for a broader construction
in a subsequent infringement action.

Use of the ﬁle wrapper
In Kirin-Amgen, Lord Hoffmann said that there were good
reasons why the German and English courts discouraged,
if not actually prohibited, the use of patent ofﬁce prosecu-
tion ﬁles in aid of the construction of claims. The reasons
included the consideration that the meaning of a patent
does not change depending on whether a party has access
to the ofﬁce ﬁle and, in any event, the ﬁle may reﬂect no
more than a patentee’s desire to get the patent granted
quickly without further argument with the examiner. In
short, it was a difﬁcult and likely unproductive exercise to
use the ﬁle wrapper to try to work out what the patentee
meant by a claim’s terms.

Taking the hint, parties and the courts made little use
of ﬁle wrappers in subsequent cases with Sir Robin Jacob
observing in Eli Lilly v Human Genome Sciences4 that he
was not conﬁdent it was legitimate to do so even though
the UK courts had yet to decide the matter conclusively.
Going further, Mr Justice Floyd in Qualcomm v Nokia5
warned that it was positively counterproductive to be re-
ferred to prosecution documents as this practice alerted

guidance on arriving at a purposive construction of a claim, the Questions

† The law of patent construction in the UK has been
largely settled since the 2004 House of Lords’ deci-
sion in Kirin-Amgen which, in conﬁrming purposive
construction as the correct approach, ruled out any
US-style doctrine of equivalence. It also doubted the
utility of
the Protocol Questions, despite their
regular application by the UK courts and the adop-
tion of similar questions in other EU jurisdictions.

† The law on ﬁle wrapper estoppel, the use of a
patent’s prosecution history to estop the patentee
from arguing a different construction during liti-
gation, has been settled for even longer. The UK
courts have felt strongly that it should not be ne-
cessary to read the prosecution history in order to
determine a patent’s scope. Germany and Canada
concur with the UK’s approach, however, the US
courts take the opposite stance with ﬁle wrapper
estoppel providing a counterbalance to its doc-
trine of equivalents.

† Mr Justice Arnold’s judgment in Actavis v Eli Lilly
has reopened both these issues. Arnold J not only
applied the previously defunct Protocol Questions
in construing Eli Lilly’s Alimta patent but then
used the patent’s prosecution history in deciding
that its claim did not extend to cover Actavis’s
variant. This comes close to the US approach cri-
ticized by Lord Hoffmann in Kirin-Amgen and
may lead to a resurrection of the Protocol Ques-
tions as a doctrine of equivalence, even if not ex-
plicitly recognized as such.

the tribunal to the fact that there might be something to
be said for the alternative construction.

The approach in the UK can be contrasted with that of
the US courts, where ﬁle wrapper estoppel provides a
counterbalance to the doctrine of equivalents in construing
a patent by ensuring that a patentee cannot argue a narrow
claim construction on validity during prosecution but then
seek to expand the scope of protection via the doctrine of
equivalents in subsequent litigation on infringement. In
contrast, the Canadian courts follow a doctrine of purpos-
ive construction with extrinsic evidence being inadmissible.
Accordingly, ﬁle wrapper estoppel has been rejected by the
courts there.6 This position also prevents a patentee from
relying on a ﬁle wrapper to show consistency of construc-
tion before a patent ofﬁce and in the courts.

Doctrine of equivalents
Returning to Kirin-Amgen, having ﬁrst conﬁrmed that the
Catnic7 principle of purposive construction was ﬁrmly
in accordance with the Protocol on the construction of
Article 69 of the European Patent Convention (EPC),
Lord Hoffmann addressed the question of equivalents:

It seems to me that both the doctrine of equivalents in the
United States and the pith and marrow doctrine in the United
Kingdom were born of despair. The Courts felt unable to
escape from interpretations which ‘unsparing logic’ appeared
to require and which prevented them from according the pa-
tentee the full extent of the monopoly which the person skilled
in the art would reasonably have thought he was claiming.

He reasoned that if literalism stood the way of constru-
ing patent claims in such a way as to give fair protection
to the patentee then there were two options available:

(i) to adhere to literalism in construction but evolve a
doctrine which supplements the claims by extend-
ing the protection of the patent to equivalents; or

(ii) to abandon literalism altogether (as the House of

Lords did in Catnic).

Lord Hoffmann found that Article 69 of the EPC had
shut the door on any doctrine (and in particular any
‘structured’ approach) which extended scope of protec-
tion beyond the claims. But he stopped short of dismiss-
ing the concept of equivalents in its entirety; instead, he
acknowledged that equivalents could be an important
part of the background that would affect the skilled
person’s understanding of a claim. His conclusions in that

respect were entirely consistent with Article 28 of the
Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69, which states
that, in balancing the literal and purposive construction
of a patent’s claims, due account should be taken of ‘any
element which is equivalent to an element speciﬁed in the
claims’. He then speciﬁcally addressed the Protocol Ques-
tions, doubting their usefulness in reaching a purposive
construction and in particular highlighting the difﬁculties
of applying the second question to new technology. In
conclusion he said that there was in reality only one ques-
tion which was compulsory: what would a person skilled
in the art have understood the patentee to have used the
language of the claim to mean?

What has followed since Kirin-Amgen has not been
unexpected; the Protocol Questions have seldom been
used in UK patent actions,
judges and practitioners
shunning the structured approach in favour of asking
Lord Hoffman’s compulsory question: ‘what would a
person skilled in the art have understood the patentee to
mean?’ In Smith & Nephew v Convatec Technologies,9 it
was even questioned whether a 1992 decision on in-
fringement of a numerical limitation would have been
decided the same way following Kirin-Amgen as it had
been using the Protocol Questions. This apparently
settled state of the law on construction is now reopened
by Mr Justice Arnold’s decision in Actavis v Eli Lilly.

Actavis v Eli Lilly
Actavis concerned Eli Lilly’s European patent protecting
the formulation of its cancer treatment, Alimta. The
patent claims the active ingredient, pemetrexed disodium,
in combination with vitamin B12 and, optionally, a folic
protein binding agent. Actavis sought declarations that its
proposed generic version of Alimta, which would contain
one of pemetrexed diacid, pemetrexed dipotasium or
pemetrexed dimethamine, did not infringe this patent. If
granted, the declarations would mean that once Eli Lilly’s
Supplementary Protection Certiﬁcate, based on an earlier
and now expired patent
for pemetrexed alone, also
expired on 10 December 2015, its path to market would
be clear. This was not just the position in the UK but in
other European jurisdictions too: since Actavis was not
challenging validity, it was allowed to seek declarations of
non-infringement under the French, Italian and Spanish
designations of the patent as well as the UK designation.
Originally, Actavis had sought a declaration in relation to
the German designation of the patent too but the claim

Ralph Cox and Simon Spink . UK claim construction: return of the Protocol questions and ﬁle wrapper estoppel ARTICLE

was eventually dropped after Eli Lilly ﬁled an infringe-
ment action in the Du¨sseldorf Regional Court.

In his judgment, Mr Justice Arnold carefully reviewed
the case law on both use of ﬁle wrappers and the doc-
trine of equivalents. On the latter, he identiﬁed three
main classes of case in which patentees resort to argu-
ments on equivalents, namely where:

(i) the patent has been poorly drafted (as in Improver);

(ii) technology has moved on signiﬁcantly since the

patent was ﬁled (as in Kirin-Amgen); and

(iii) the patentee regretted a decision taken during the

course of prosecution.

He considered Actavis to be a clear example of the third
category. Eli Lilly had attempted to broaden its claims in
prosecution to cover ‘pemetrexed’, failed and accepted the
narrower claims to pemetrexed disodium. It had reserved
the right to ﬁle a divisional application, but did not do so.
Several years on, faced with a competing product, it
clearly wished it had broader claims in order to catch
Actavis’s product on infringement. But there was ‘no
reason why the law should be sympathetic to the patentee’,
which not only had the beneﬁt of skilled professional
advice but also had the opportunity to appeal against
adverse decisions by patent examiners. Further, from a
policy point of view, to allow examiners’ decisions effect-
ively to be overturned by the courts on claim construction
would undermine their important role in balancing the
monopoly granted with the disclosure given. Against this
background, Mr Justice Arnold made use of the prosecu-
tion history as one of several reasons why Eli Lilly’s broad
construction, that pemetrexed disodium encompassed
other salts because the important pemetrexed anion was
present irrespective of the cation used, should be rejected.
Further, it is signiﬁcant that Mr Justice Arnold choose to
use the Protocol Questions when construing the scope of the
claims. He noted that the Questions had fallen out of fashion
since Kirin-Amgen, which he regarded to be unfortunate as,
despite their shortcomings, they provided a structured ap-
proach to the question of equivalents and had been inﬂuen-
tial across Europe. Other factors inﬂuencing the judge’s
decision to use the Protocol Questions were that there was
no dispute that the alleged infringement was not within the
primary, literal meaning of the claim and that the parties
themselves had used the Questions for consistency of their
submissions on the non-UK designations. What is also sig-
niﬁcant about this choice is that Mr Justice Arnold chose to
resurrect the Protocol Questions when there were other (and
better-trodden) routes he could have taken to reach the same
destination should he have wished. As with all ﬁrst instance

decisions, it is now a matter of waiting for the Court of
Appeal’s decision to see if the Protocol Questions do indeed
have a new lease of life as a means of introducing a form of
equivalence and whether ﬁle wrapper estoppel is here to stay.
Meanwhile, in Du¨sseldorf, the District Court granted
an interim injunction against Actavis ﬁnding infringement
of the German designation of the patent by its threatened
dealings in pemetrexed dipotassium and on the basis of
equivalence rather than literal infringement of the patent’s
claims. As an aid to construction the German courts use a
set of questions which at ﬁrst read are not dissimilar to the
Protocol Questions but that arguably give greater scope
for a ﬁnding of equivalence (particularly in the third ques-
tion which considers the technical effect of the equivalent
means rather than circling back to the language of the
claim as in the Protocol Questions). This approach is not
generally counter-balanced by reference to a patent’s pros-
ecution history and was not in this instance.

Construction, caveat and caution
Mr Justice Arnold observed that the US has a doctrine of
equivalents with a doctrine of ﬁle wrapper estoppel to
counterbalance it. Recent case law suggested the UK had
neither. The judge’s considered use of the Protocol Ques-
tions and ﬁle wrapper estoppel (albeit only in the case of
the regretful patentee) in his judgment suggests that the
status quo could be changing. As could be expected he
issued a caveat regarding his use of ﬁle wrapper estoppel,
cautioning that the use of prosecution history should
only be when it is short, simple and shows clearly why
the claims are in their granted form and not broader.

As regards the Protocol Questions, they merely fell out
of favour after Kirin-Amgen. Lord Hoffmann may have
shut the door on doctrines that explicitly extended the
protection outside the claims but he left it ajar in terms of
the Protocol Questions. Mr Justice Arnold clearly felt this
was one of the cases where the Questions were useful
—but applying them where there is plainly no literal in-
fringement comes very close to Lord Hoffmann’s descrip-
tion of the US approach, ie ‘to adhere to literalism in
construing the claims and evolve a doctrine which supple-
ments the claims by extending protection to equivalents’.
Even if not explicitly recognized as a doctrine of equiva-
lence, the decision may therefore lead to a resurrection of
the Protocol Questions by patentees effectively arguing
just that. The decision may also see a renewed use of the
Protocol Questions as an aid to construction generally
but it seems unlikely to return to the time when every am-
biguity in a claim was routinely put through them.
