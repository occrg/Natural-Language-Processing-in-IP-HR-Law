      "1 Vectorisation\n",
      "\n",
      "The most impactful changes on the eﬃciency of the function involved optimising it for vectorisation.\n",
      "Vectorisation is where the compiler parallelises code by performing an operation, lying within a for\n",
      "loop, on a vector containing several elements of a subject array simultaneously. This is as opposed to\n",
      "performing the operation on sequentially on each element of the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order for the compiler to vectorise code eﬀectively, for loops and data accesses need to take\n",
      "a certain form. One important rule is to make sure that array elements are accessed incrementally\n",
      "according to their index. This is so the compiler can put elements positioned next to each other in\n",
      "memory in vectors. This was not the case in the original code as the variable i was on the inside of\n",
      "a nested loop which was being multiplied in the index of arrays. By changing the loops in the ﬁnal\n",
      "program we see a decrease in the time taken by a factor of 11 for an 8000x8000 image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another rule is to make sure it is clear to the compiler that there will be no pointer aliasing in\n",
      "the program using the restrict keyword. Without it, the vectorisation report states that there is an\n",
      "assumed dependence between arrays. Putting restrict in sees a decrease in the time taken by a factor\n",
      "of 5 for an 8000x8000 image.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third rule is to make sure operations are separated to make it simple for the compiler to perform\n",
      "them. This is a compromise since I initially hypothesised that it would be faster to do all the operations\n",
      "at once so the subject array element would only have to be loaded and stored once. This ended up\n",
      "mattering little, probably since the cost of going to a low-level cache is very small. It would also have\n",
      "the beneﬁt of allowing factorisation so less costly multiplication would need to be done. The beneﬁts\n",
      "of vectorisation outweigh this, however, as the vectorised version is marginally faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Data types\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of data type has a signiﬁcant impact on the eﬃciency of the program. The original code\n",
      "used doubles, each consisting of eight bytes which is unnecessarily precise for the task being performed.\n",
      "Floats consist of four bytes each and are suﬃcient to pass the test. Changing from doubles to ﬂoats\n",
      "doubles the operational intensity of the function which is especially beneﬁcial as the program is memory\n",
      "bandwidth bound so we want to minimise the number of bytes loaded and stored per operation. Doing\n",
      "this approximately halves the time taken to run the function for all image sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "The ﬂoating point operation, division, takes far more clock cycles to compute than multiplication\n",
      "because the Intel compiler used divides by ﬁrst ﬁnding the reciprocal of the denominator and then\n",
      "multiplying it. This is why replacing all division operations with multiplication reduces the time taken\n",
      "to run the function by a factor of 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 Storing variables\n",
      "\n",
      "Aware that memory bandwidth is often the bottleneck for programs, I originally approached the task\n",
      "with the attitude that no variables should be stored and all repeated values should be recomputed.\n",
      "After some trial and error, this was the slowest approach. Recomputing multiplications turned out to\n",
      "be slightly slower than retrieving data from a low-level cache. It was fastest, albeit only just, to take a\n",
      "mixed approach with values that were computed with multiplication and that were used several times\n",
      "stored as variables with simple, less used, values recalculated every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 Compilers\n",
      "\n",
      "My ﬁnal program is compiled using the command: ”icc -O3 -xHOST -std=c99 -Wall stencil.c -o stencil”.\n",
      "I chose to use the icc compiler because of its automatic vectorisation which enabled all the speed\n",
      "increases mentioned in the ﬁrst section. As can be seen below in Graph 1c, the gcc compiler performs\n",
      "similarly to using the icc compiler with the -O1 ﬂag. This is because vectorisation is disabled with\n",
      "the -O1 ﬂag. The -O3 ﬂag performs best because it is designed for loop-heavy programs that operate\n",
      "on large datasets. xHost marginally increases the eﬃciency of the program by telling the compiler to\n",
