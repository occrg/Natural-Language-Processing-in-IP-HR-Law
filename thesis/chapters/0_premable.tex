\section*{Executive Summary}	
	This project is a contribution to a law academic's research into the growing relationship between intellectual 	property law and human rights law; in particular, the extent to which intellectual property laws involve human rights considerations, and their balance between consideration of creators and users. 
	
	The first technical objective for the project is to use natural language processing to estimate measures of these two aspects for input law journals and statutes. This will involve using Python to explore a variety of machine learning models, starting with support vector machines, to optimise results. Classifications will be evaluated using F1-scores and compared against current research's achievements. 
	
	The second is to collaborate with the law acadmic iteratively to find the most appropriate way to visualise the results for the project's domain using 'matplotlib' for plotting and tKinter for the user interface. Success in this objective will be based upon typical human computer interaction practices.
	
	Currently, the relationship between intellectual property and human rights is analysed on a case-by-case basis due to a lack of systematic means of analysis. The project will give that systematic method and therefore allow a more comprehensive argument to be made about the relationship.  
	
	The project is likely to be successful because there have previously been successfully projects that involved similar topic classification tasks. It will, however, be made individual from many of these by my iterative approach to the project, collaborating with a law academic to find the most appropriate way to classify and visualise the results. 
	
	Should it be successful, the project will further understanding of how past events have impacted intellectual property laws.
