\begin{document}


% This macro creates the standard UoB title page by using information drawn
% from the document class (meaning it is vital you select the correct degree 
% title and so on).

\maketitle

% After the title page (which is a special case in that it is not numbered)
% comes the front matter or preliminaries; this macro signals the start of
% such content, meaning the pages are numbered with Roman numerals.

\frontmatter

% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.

\makedecl


% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures, tables and algorithms.  The former is a compulsory part of the
% dissertation, but if you do not require the latter they can be suppressed
% by simply commenting out the associated macro.
